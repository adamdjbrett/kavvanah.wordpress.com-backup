										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted a more critical approach to Fackenheim than found in the works of Michael Morgan so I turned to David Patterson, Emil Fackenheim Syracuse UP 2008. The book won the 2008 National Jewish Book Award in the category of Modern Jewish Thought, so I assumed it would be more critical.For Patterson, Fackenheim represents a Jewish thinker who affirms the centrality of Torah, yet does not despair of philosophy the way Levinas and Soloveitchik despair. Fackenheim has the tikkun for the darkness at the heart of man as told by Joseph Conrad or Primo Levi. The height of the book for me was when Patterson used the thought of the kabbalist Yitzhak Ginzburgh to explain Hannah Arendt, that too much ego leads to absolute evil.</p>
<p>A different approach is offered by Konstanty Gebert. An observant Polish Jew who was instrumental as an educator and journalist in Solidarity. He now edits Midrasz, a Polish-Jewish monthly.  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/week-in-the-life-konstanty-gebert-journalist--silk-screen-expert-helps-poles-and-jews-heal-ancient-wounds-1101026.html">Interview with him</a></p>
<p>He wrote an article &#8220;Forgetting Amalek&#8221; in Responsibility in Crisis, editor David William Cohen &amp; Michael Kennedy 183-201</p>
<p>Gebert writes that the Torah teaches us to wipe out the memory of Amalek but to always remember their treachery – there is a tension of memory/oblivion</p>
<p>Emil Fackenheim offers the 614<sup>th</sup> commandment. For Gebert, that is like the situation described by Gregory Bateson, a double bind that produces pathological disassociation or a catch -22. If the Shoah makes one turn away from religion then the 614<sup>th</sup> commandment to not give Hitler a posthumous victory by turning away. It means that one is either not true to one’s self or is helping the holocaust. One cannot turn away and if one accepts the call of the Holocaust one disassociates from oneself.</p>
<p>He ponders if Amalek in the Torah, as pure evil, is a construct based on their trauma and not on actual knowledge of Amalakites.  Hating Amalek was an easy thing in their post traumatic stage and the inherited trauma of their immediate descendents.</p>
<p>But, the Babylonians mixed all the tribes in the area through forced relocations. This nullified the commandment to eliminate the Amalek, because at that point the Amalek ceased to exist as a tribe.</p>
<p>Gebert thinks that the university today has a responsibility to help prevent the creation of new Amalek images. We need to separate historic understanding from justifying. We need free debate and intellectual liberty.</p>
<p>Now Amalek’s children themselves need to condemn the evil and work together with the children of victims. We need to remember the evil of Amalek, but the only way to truly wipe out Amalek is through reconciliation. Children of Amalek will come to naught if not helped by the children of the victims.</p>
<p>As a comparison, Avi Sagi sought to justify the Biblical prohibition and explain the moral problem now that we have modern morals, many commentaries on Joshua and Samuel also resort to justification and limiting, but not to reconciliation or the role of the university.  <em>The Punishment of Amalek in Jewish Tradition: Coping with the Moral Problem</em>, Avi Sagi, Harvard Theological Review Vol.87, No.3 (1994)</p>
<p>Reb Shlomo and Reb Zalman taught that we have to turn to simcha to overcome the inner darkness. Then we have to return to Torah in a more open way. <a href="http://rebshlomo.org/transcriptions/the-shoah-the-holocaust-and-helping-to-rebuild-a-new-world/"> Reb Shlomo text.</a></p>
<p>In contrast, the Haredi world, based on a teshuvah of Rabbi Menashe Klein, overcomes the Holocaust by creating a saving remnant of true Jews. They focus only on the true Haredi Jews and limit the validity of conversions including <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1067342.html">Emil Fackenheim’s son</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sukkot is the holiday of the 6<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> centuries: Hoshanot are from this period, according to Goldschmidt. As is the custom of waving the lulav in 6 directions.</p>
<p>First, Some random 6<sup>th</sup> -9<sup>th</sup> century ideas</p>
<p><strong>Guilt and treating the sukkah as exile, not as presense.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Said R&#8217; El&#8217;azar bar Maryom: Why do we make a sukkah after Yom Kippur? To teach you that on Rosh Hashanah The Holy One, Blessed Be He, sits in judgment on all mankind, and on Yom Kippur He signs the verdict. Perhaps Israel&#8217;s sentence is exile; therefore they make a sukkah and exile themselves from their homes to their sukkah Pesikta of Rav Kahana Parasha 2 addenda, Mandelbaum 457)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> Don&#8217;t go to Great Adventure or other entertainment for chol hamoed.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The festivals make a difference between the nations and Israel: the nations eat and drink, and go to the circus and the theater, and anger the Lord by their words and deeds; Israel eats and drinks and goes to the houses of prayer to praise His name and to the houses of study  to learn His glory. Pesikta 340-1</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Vicarious atonement for the nations</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Just as this dove atones for sins, so does Israel atone for the nations, for all those seventy bulls which are sacrificed on the festival are on behalf of the seventy nations, so that the world not be bereft of them, as is written (Psalms 109) &#8220;<em>They answer my love with accusation but I am all prayer&#8221;</em> Midrash Shir Hashirim Rabba 1.<em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;All seventy bulls that Israel used to sacrifice on the festival were for the seventy nations of the world, so that they not be removed from the world, as it is said: &#8216;They answer my love with accusation, but I am all prayer&#8217; (Ps. 109:4). That is, now they are protected by prayer instead of sacrifice.&#8221;<em> Pesikta de Rav Kahana</em> (par. 30)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And now 1000 years later, three very different fin de siècle 20<sup>th</sup> century ideas</strong></p>
<p>1] Chief Rabbi Dr Jonathan Sacks writing that the sukkah helps us identify with the poor of “Calcutta and Caracas.” <em>Dignity of Difference</em> 112</p>
<p>2 The sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1880-1950) spoke of seven &#8220;chassidic <em>ushpizin</em>&#8221; as well: the Baal Shem Tov, the Maggid (Rabbi DovBer of Mezeritch), and the first five rebbes of Chabad: Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch, Rabbi Menachem Mendel (the &#8220;Tzemach Tzeddek&#8221;), Rabbi Shmuel, and Rabbi Sholom DovBer.</p>
<p>Where I was for one or the meals the debate was between the method starting with the Besht or now should they start with the Alter Rebbe and end with the 7<sup>th</sup> Rebbe. This seems more widespread than I thought. Have the Biblical Ushpizin lost their resonance?</p>
<p>3] Old time R Shlomo Carlebach moving he six directions from cosmology or sefirot to personal experience of religion. <a href="http://www.mishpacha.org/sukkotlulav.shtml"> link</a></p>
<blockquote><p>First, face right. Right in Kabbalah signifies the attribute of <em>hesed</em>, kindness, mercy, overwhelming beneficence. Do you find it too hard to be generous? Or are you suffering from an excess of generosity, of kindness, of love? &#8221;</p>
<p>Then face left. Left in Kabbalah is <em>gevurah</em> – strength, strict judgment, limits. <em>Gevurah</em> is Isaac – bound for sacrifice on Mount  Moriah, unflinching, accepting of judgment. Take this opportunity to think of the limits, the judgments in your life. Are your circumstances too confining? Do you need more boundaries, or fewer? Do you need more strength? This is an opportunity to invite God to help you fix the limits in your life.</p>
<p>Next, face straight ahead: <em>tiferet, </em>or beauty. This is the balance, where the beneficence and the boundaries are in their proper proportions. It is Jacob, it is the middle course.</p>
<p>Then, look up. Can you connect with God? What’s the holiness you need in your life? How high can you rise this year?</p>
<p>Then, aim down. This is about groundedness, about your foundations. And it’s about your ability to find the buried treasures, under your feet; the truths buried in the dirt.</p>
<p>Finally, backwards. The essence of repentance is being able to go back and fix your past  by your coming to terms with it</p></blockquote>
<p>I find these three approaches to be quite different: the metonymic ethical, the binding to a saint, and the introspective.</p>
