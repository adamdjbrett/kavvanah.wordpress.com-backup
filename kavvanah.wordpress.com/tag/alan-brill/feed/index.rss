										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to give a Jewish response to the following paper by the Harvard historian Professor Kevin Madigan at a recent conference. The papers have just been published. Madigan spoke as a historian and I spoke about memory. For those interested in the topic, the papers provide a full bibliography in the footnotes.<br />
Kevin Madigan, <a href="http://escholarship.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1228&amp;context=scjr">Has the Papacy &#8216;Owned&#8217; Vatican Guilt for the Church&#8217;s Role in the Holocaust?</a><br />
Alan Brill, <a href="http://escholarship.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1230&amp;context=scjr">Does the Church ‘Get’ the Holocaust? A Response to Kevin Madigan</a></p>
<p><strong>Here are my conclusions. If you want more information then see the original papers or if you want to enter the discussion, then please read the original papers first.</strong> </p>
<p><em>A few concluding observations<br />
(1) There is a sincere attempt by the Vatican for reconciliation, and reconciliation is indeed the goal.</p>
<p>(2) There is also a sincere attempt by the Vatican for moral reckoning of antisemitism; however, they also have other forefront concerns, including the pastoral, liturgical, and doctrinal life of the Church.</p>
<p>(3) I completely agree with Professor Madigan’s conclusions to the question about historic reckoning. Nevertheless, issues should not be conceptualized only in the present.</p>
<p>(4) However, the understanding of Jewish Holocaust memory is intermittent. Most of the time the Holocaust is understood as a Jewish tragedy, though Vatican speeches may not reveal this understanding. When going to a Holocaust memorial to show respect to the Jewish people while<br />
accompanied by a group of Jews, Church representatives need to understand that the Holocaust is not the “30 million people killed by the fascists” nor is it a “universal problem of inhumanity and evil in the world.” For Jews, it is a war against six million Jews as Jews, with the Jews singled out for extermination. At a minimum this is demanded by diplomacy and propriety; at best it requires empathy for Jewish memory. There is a noticeable lack of a personal empathy and empathetic regret.</p>
<p>(5) Is there an understanding by the Church of the Jewish sense of the Tremendum? Do they &#8220;get” the Jewish silence, bereft of theological answers? Do they “get” the rupturing of Jewish faith, leaving a sense of Jewish brokenness? The answer is no. Few Jews evoke the eternal<br />
covenants as a comfort<br />
.<br />
(6) Finally, current Church statements made in light of the Holocaust, are not addressing the past 2000 years of Christian anti-Judaism. Fr. Edward Flannery’s observation in the Introduction to his book The Anguish of the Jews” still holds true: Christians have torn from their history<br />
books the pages that Jews have memorized.</em></p>
<p><strong>From one of the sections that I was particularly interested in:</strong><br />
<em>Pope Benedict conceptualizes the Holocaust using the critical theory of the Frankfort School, especially that of Theodore Adorno and Jürgen Habermas… He speaks to the Historikerstreit, occuring in the 1980s which debated the role of the Holocaust in history. He sides with Adorno and Habermas against Nolte and Fest. But this discussion does not in any way respond to Jewish memory.<br />
Neither does his discussion of the Holocaust in Spe Salvi (In Hope We Are Saved) which asserts that the horrible injustices of history should not have the final word. There must finally be true justice. But that, in the words the Pope quotes from Adorno, would require a world “where not only present suffering would be wiped out, but also that which is irrevocably past would be undone.” This would mean the resurrection of the dead (no. 42). God now reveals his true face in the figure of the sufferer who shares man&#8217;s God-forsaken condition by taking it upon himself. This innocent sufferer has attained the certitude of hope: there is a God, and God can create justice in a way that we cannot conceive, yet we can begin to grasp it through faith. Yes, there is a resurrection of the flesh. (42-43)</p>
<p>In Benedict’s theological works on the Christian meaning of modernity, especially as typified by the Holocaust, his goal is to provide salvific hope before a rampant loss of values. Jewish memory of the Holocaust is not addressed. When Pope Benedict considers the theological<br />
issues of the Holocaust he thinks of Adorno’s question and the pastoral answer of crucifixion and resurrection. He does not think of recent Jewish Holocaust theologians. In this, Pope Benedict is similar to many Orthodox Jewish theologians, who are not interested in historicity or Holocaust theology, and are more concerned with either the eternal values of the halakhah or the pastoral need to spread Judaism. They hear a commanding voice from Sinai and Zion and not from Auschwitz. Thus, it would be unfair to ask Benedict to adopt specific positions in Holocaust theology or to place the Jewish-Christian relationship at the center of his theology. He is a pastoral leader for Catholics, and he has a vision for their doctrinal, liturgical, and institutional needs. It is fair, however, to expect him to address the specific Jewish memory of the Holocaust when he is speaking to a Jewish audience at a Jewish sponsored event, such as at Yad Vashem.</em></p>
<p><strong>If you have never read the Studies in Jewish Christian relations before, especially since it does not show up in google search, <a href="http://escholarship.bc.edu/scjr/vol1/iss1/">here is the first issue from 4 years ago</a>, which is a good place to start.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Editorial Reviews</strong></p>
<p>“This wide-ranging but carefully organized collection of Jewish thought about other religions constitutes an indispensable resource for Jews and non-Jews engaged in interreligious relations today and for Jews seeking to develop a text-based contemporary Jewish theology of religions for our global world. Brill accompanies his lucid presentations of each approach with insightful critiques that will help guide their contemporary applications.”—Ruth Langer, Associate Professor of Jewish Studies, Theology Department Associate Director, Center for Christian-Jewish Learning, Boston College</p>
<p>“Serious Jewish engagement with other religions has substantially deepened and widened in recent years, both stimulating and responding to an increasing interest in Judaism from within the other world religions. Brill’s book provides essential access to the classical sources within the Jewish tradition relevant to this encounter.”—Rabbi Dr. David Rosen, International Director of Interreligious Affairs, AJC</p>
<p>“This is an excellent work: reflective, engaging, well-written, and perhaps most important—timely. Brill knows both the theoretical foundations for interreligious dialogue and rabbinic approaches to ‘other religions.’ It is a fine piece of scholarship, and it is also creative in bringing together three fields of discourse in a way they have not before been aligned. It blends both traditional and modern thinking about interreligious dialogue, and it analyzes these materials convincingly.”—Nathan Katz, Professor of Religious Studies, Florida International University</p>
<p><strong>Product Description</strong></p>
<p>With insight and scholarship, Alan Brill crisply outlines the traditional Jewish approaches to other religions for an age of globalization. He provides a fresh perspective on Biblical and Rabbinic texts, offering new ways of thinking about other faiths. In the majority of volume, he develops the categories of theology of religions for Jewish texts. He arranges the texts according classification widely used in interfaith work: inclusivist, exclusivist, universalist, and pluralist.</p>
<p>Judaism and Other Religions is essential for a Jewish theological understanding of the various issues in encounters with other religions. With passion and clarity, Brill argues that in today’s world of strong religious passions and intolerance, it is necessary to go beyond secular tolerance toward moderate and mediating religious positions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Fall issue of Modern Judaism 29/3 October 2009, there is a devastating review of Gordon Tucker’s translation of Heschel’s <em>Heavenly Torah</em> in which he claims the original meaning of Heschel is lost in translation. He seems to be bending over backwards not to be scathing,but his bottom line is that Tucker omitted paragraphs essential for arguments, manipulated the material to make Heschel seem like a pluralist, and even worse, he inserted his own pluralist editorial comments into the text of Heschel without any indication that these are not Heschel’s words.</p>
<p>Haber also claims that Heschel sought to determine a correct position in Aggadah, that he uses traditional phrases like &#8220;principles of faith,&#8221; that he often follows Rabbi Akiva and Tucker will present Heschel as following Rabbi Yishmael when he really was following Rabbi Akiva.. The worst is that in the crucial section on Maimonides position on Torah from Sinai, Tucker added his own explanation at the expanse of Heschel’s own words. Therefore, I must correct <a href="http://www.edah.org/backend/journalarticle/aggadic%20man%20brill-final.pdf">what I wrote in my own review of Heschel,</a> based on the English translation, that the discussion of Maimonides was “not theology or halakhic,” what I need to say is that Tucker’s additions are the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_judaism/summary/v029/29.3.haber.html">Lost In Translation: Abraham Joshua Heschel&#8217;s &#8220;Heavenly Torah&#8221;—A Review Essay-</a> Gedalia Haber</p>
<p>Although Heschel is aware of the plurality of opinions shared by the Sages, I found that he nevertheless strives to determine which opinion is correct, according to its compatibility with the simple meaning of the biblical text (<em>Peshuto shel Mikra</em>).However, when I compared certain words and phrases in Tucker&#8217;s translation to Heschel&#8217;s original text, to my surprise, I discovered that Heschel&#8217;s intent was often obscured or omitted entirely.</p>
<p>In the pages that follow I shall demonstrate a few basic differences between &#8220;my Heschel&#8221; and &#8220;Tucker&#8217;s Heschel.&#8221; … This juxtaposition will reveal critical areas where Heschel&#8217;s intent has been altered, and will retrieve &#8220;lost&#8221; ideas that were omitted or adapted in Tucker&#8217;s work. This will help to reconsider the question of Heschel&#8217;s views regarding religious pluralism and the diversity of opinions characteristic of Aggadah.</p>
<p>Heschel&#8217;s explicit parallel between Jewish law and Jewish thought is omitted in Tucker&#8217;s translation, and all that remains is the dichotomy between Halacha and matters beyond Halacha….Tucker does not translate this passage, although it seems that Heschel is stating a fundamental principle.</p>
<p>Tucker&#8217;s translation undermines Heschel&#8217;s certainty, and while it may render Heschel&#8217;s ambitious claim more digestible, at the same time it reverses Heschel&#8217;s opinion completely.</p>
<p>Another example of Heschel&#8217;s decisive attitude toward Aggadic material is his discussion of R. Akiva&#8217;s view regarding revelation. According to Heschel, R. Akiva claimed that Moses ascended to heaven in order to receive the Torah.<sup> </sup>Heschel claims that &#8220;this matter of the ascent of a mortal to heaven is very important in the <em>Torah of faith</em>. Judaism demands that man should acknowledge his place. A basic rule in Israel: &#8216;God is in heaven, and you are on earth&#8217; [. . .].</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;Torah of faith&#8221; should be understood as the doctrine of faith, since the context is &#8220;Judaism&#8217;s demand&#8221; of man. However, Tucker subverts Heschel&#8217;s intention by transforming Heschel&#8217;s prescriptive, dogmatic style into a historical, descriptive one: &#8220;The theme of human ascent to heaven is of great importance in the <em>study of religion, but</em> Judaism demands that humans should know their place. Israel lives by the rule: &#8220;God is in heaven, and you are on earth.&#8221;<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Heschel&#8217;s critique of Maimonides&#8217; view of Torah from Heaven is the climax of <em>TMS</em> II,… Although Tucker retains Heschel&#8217;s title (&#8220;Maimonides&#8217; Ruling&#8221;), he transforms Heschel&#8217;s discussion from a Halachic attack on Maimonides to a criticism of Maimonides&#8217; &#8220;perfectionist&#8221; attitude. Tucker&#8217;s version does read that &#8220;Maimonides came down on the more stringent side,&#8221; but Tucker adds an interjection which is not present in the original text: &#8220;Is such perfectionism possible?&#8221;.Tucker proceeds to omit the phrase &#8216;if the Halacha is established according to the Sifrei,&#8217; and shifts Heschel&#8217;s Halachic polemic to the realm of criticism of the high &#8220;standard&#8221; that Maimonides set for us.</p>
<p>I disagree with his claim that Heschel is promoting the more pluralistic exegesis of the Yishmaelian  School.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of Heschel&#8217;s critique? Alan Brill rightfully points out that in Heschel&#8217;s discussion of rabbinic sources in <em>TMS</em>, &#8220;there is no historical change or driving force to history.&#8221;<sup> </sup>Heschel holds an ahistorical conception of Jewish thought. Contrary to the view that Jewish thought and practice developed in certain directions, and what was once considered legitimate might be considered heretical today (and vice versa), Heschel claims that there is a unity between generations. However, this lenient or  liberal view is not pluralistic, and it does not leave room for Maimonides&#8217; &#8220;perfectionist attitude.&#8221; Heschel sees it as the objective truth, which demands submission.</p>
<p>Tucker comments on this that the &#8220;halachic pluralism&#8221; implied by the Talmud is a &#8220;long established fact,&#8221;…However, Heschel restricts this pluralism one paragraph later and states:</p>
<p>The Divine Voice declares: &#8220;These and these are [both] the words of the living God, but Halacha is established according to the school of Hillel.&#8221; Many students who have not studied sufficiently have regarded this saying according to the rule: &#8220;split the sentence&#8221;; they took its beginning and ignored its ending [. . .] as if the world were chaotic. As if permission had been granted for each person to build an altar for himself.</p>
<p>Moreover, is the power of every scholar equal to the power of Hillel and Shammai or R. Akiva and R. Yishmael? Is an innkeeper&#8217;s wife equal to wife of a priest? Does the trivial discussion of idlers compare to the complete Torah of the forefathers? Many scholars who have not studied sufficiently cannot be considered laymen anymore but did not reach the level of the great [rabbis]. &#8221;</p>
<p>These omissions and rewordings obscure what Heschel tried to convey and are barriers between Heschel&#8217;s thought and the English reader…However, as I have shown, Tucker eliminates fundamental passages and phrases without commenting on their absence. I believe the message they convey is no petty matter.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will update this when I have something in English. Human Dignity is a cross cultural way, somewhat euphemistic way , of bringing up religious liberty, religious freedom,  minority rights, and respect for other faiths. I do not have to speak at this one, so I have it easier. I do not know why the website does not even have anything for Tuesday, Dec 8th.</p>
<p><strong>La Fundación Tres Culturas acogerá durante los días 9 y 10 de diciembre este encuentro, en el que importantes líderes de las tres religiones monoteístas se reunirán por primera vez.</strong></p>
<p>De este modo, está confirmada la intervención de los cardenales Kasper y Tauran,  y el metropolitano Emmanuel Adamakis, entro otros. Así pues, dada la relevancia de los asistentes como su alta participación (se congregarán alrededor de 25 líderes religiosos), podemos entender este encuentro como una oportunidad única para desarrollar un trabajo sustancial en una atmósfera de confianza mutua.</p>
<p>Estas jornadas se centrarán, como asunto general, en las implicaciones de la dignidad humana para las tres tradiciones monoteístas. A partir de esta cuestión troncal, se desarrollarán tres subtemas: <em>La santidad de la vida; ¿absoluta o limitada?</em>; <em>Reconciliando la responsabilidad individual o comuna</em>; y <em>Derechos Humanos y libertad de religión</em>.</p>
<p>Las sesiones tendrán lugar a puerta cerrada, a fin de propiciar el clima de diálogo entre los diferentes ponentes.</p>
<p>Wednesday, December 9<br />
10:00 &#8211; 11:30 h. Opening Session<br />
12:00 &#8211; 13:15 h. Presentation of a Jewish, Christian and Muslim speaker<br />
about the human dignity<br />
17:30 h. Plenary Session for organizing the three workshops<br />
17:45 &#8211; 18:00 h. Three workshops according to the sub-themes:<br />
1. Sanctity of Life: Absolute or Qualifieded?<br />
2. Reconciling Individual and Communal Responsibility?<br />
3. Human Rights and the Freedom of Religion</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/120111/">Steve Nadler gives a favorable review</a> to Marc Angel’s  <em>Maimonides, Spinoza and Us: Toward an Intellectually Vibrant Judaism.</em> Nadler, nevertheless places his critiques between the lines. Nadler supports Spinoza’s concept of rationality in which we live rational human beings.  Angel wants Judaism without superstition. But is a lack of superstition the same as rationality?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rambam and Spinoza both located superstition in the realm of ignorance and irrational fear…. Rational people will learn to overcome the tendency toward superstition and will root their lives in reason and in an intellectual love of God.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On this I am overwhelmed by .the simplicity of the definition of rationality. Much of the philosophy of the 1970’s and 1980s discussed rationality. Winch said that it is all contextual, and after some great volumes by Bryan Wilson and then Hollis &amp; Lucas we conclude with Taylor’s defense of universal rationality but as within a given system. In that middle period we had many such as Douglas and Turner who said that the term is only in reference to one’s system- it reveals how one defined one’s social order.</p>
<p>Treating Maimonides as rejecting superstition is following the minimal Maimonideans somewhere between the Rashba’s rejection of kaparot and the Meiri rejecting non- philosophic agadot. It is not the Maimonides of the philosophers- it is not Gersonides, Falquera, or Narboni. It is not even the Maimonideanism of Radak who discusses how he studies the natural order on Shabbat. Maiimonides is here for the broad community- no superstition but not the Maimonides of those who read.  There is no offering of a new Guide of the Perplexed that combines the philosophy of our age and Judaism .</p>
<p>Nadler concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the success of Angel’s project depends on how well he manages tensions that will be apparent to contemporary rationalist critics of religious belief. For example, while decrying attempts to import superstitious elements into Jewish practice (talismans, prayer for hire, etc.), he suggests that (according to Maimonides) the harm they bring includes the loss of one’s portion in the world to come. And Angel himself apparently believes in the efficacy of prayer, because “God is always present and listening everywhere.” These and other elements of even an “intellectually vibrant” Judaism will strike nonbelievers as no less superstitious than red strings and amulets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eliezer Goldman, following Weber, had already written that Maimonides is rational not in the modern sense but in the sense of having a fixed goal and system and then working within it. The rejection of superstition seems to define a current social order. Maimonides would actually reject  “God is always present and listening everywhere” in its modern American usage. In the Guide it is defined in more naturalistic terms.</p>
<p>We can use a good discussion of how these beliefs  connect to modern scientific worldview. The 1970’s rationality debate used as their example the Azande of Africa who followed the natural order but also resorted to witchcraft to provide meaning, telos, and remove contingency. The natural and the religious may be on two separate planes. In this case, Maimonides describes a theoretical sabian magic and then uses as a yardstick and rubric to explain how one should relate to the commandments without magical idolatry. In the modern case, we want a rational Orthodoxy, so we project  a lack of rationality onto others, henceforth called superstition, and if we don&#8217;t violate our own definition then willy-nilly, we are rational.</p>
<p>Maybe we can be more like the Azande and accept have both the natural order and witchcraft? or more like Spinoza and have rational educated lives and have religion as its own realm? or we can be like Maimonides himself who had an esoteric Torah for the philosophers and the fighting of superstition for the masses and that philosophy that should not be brought to the masses?. And what of symbolist approaches such as Ricoeur?</p>
<blockquote><p>How can there be a faith-based sectarian religion that is informed by rational thinking, one that avoids the Scylla of irrational faith and the Charybdis of rational unbelief?</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems like a false dichotomy and does not correspond to the fragmented, multiple realms of our lives.  Nor does it correspond to context of rationality. My question is: how does this dichotomy portray a very specific social order of what is in and what is out. Do we all really color just within the printed lines of a coloring book?</p>
<blockquote><p>Maimonides believed the ancient prophets to be morally and intellectually gifted individuals — much like philosophers, except with greater imaginative powers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this a potential definition of prophecy as a acquired perfection? Does this require a philosophic reading of the Bible? And wouldn&#8217;t this negate the vibrant literary reading that people are giving to the Bible? The Bible should only be understood by gifted individuals like the prophets. Should we create a prophetic Orthodoxy teaching people to attain these levels? And as Feyerabend ended his classic work <em>Against Method </em>&#8211; &#8211; If a non system allowed Rabbi Akiva to gain knowledge of the heikhalot- who  re we to try and impose a rational system?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I have managed to still be here after 2 months.</p>
<p>I have learned that when I go away for a few days, I need to place a notice that I am away.</p>
<p>I have learned that many people show up Saturday night -after shabbat. Most people visit in the weekday evenings. I cannot usually guess what get the most hits. I expected the Trude Weiss Rosmarin post to get many hits and a friend even transcribed the entire article. But I would have not expected that the <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/david-nirenberg-on-the-jewish-muslim-relations-in-christian-spain/">David Nirenberg article</a> on Jewish-Muslim relations in Christian Spain to be one of big hits. On the other hand, I am quite surprised that no one is looking at the Novak posts <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/novak-social-contract-part-ii-of-iii-parts/">here </a>and <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/novak-natural-law-in-judiasm-part-1/">here</a>. I learned that <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/10/avot-ibn-ezra-and-being-a-mentch/">three book reviews from Haaretz </a>in a single post is too much. I also learned that if I announce<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/catholic-jewish-interfaith-dialogue-timothy-m-dolan-and-arnold-m-eisen/"> a public event</a>, I find that readers will show up.</p>
<p>I will be teaching contemporary Jewish thought in the Spring, thinkers of the last 15 years. So even if people are not interested in Novak, you will hear more about Fishbane, Halbertal, Boyarin and others. And more on Sacks and Benedict. There will also be more Kabbalah and spirituality.</p>
<p>If you want to comment on a post then post it, dont send an email. But if you want to comment on the general content or to let me know you are out there,  and you are not already on weekly (or monthly) email contact feel free to drop me a line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been asked by several people  for a copy of my article on Rabbi Walter Wurzburger&#8217;s thought-<em> A Tiny but Articulate Minority</em> TRADITION 41:2 (2008). So here it is below. Wurzburger  formulated an existential and Kantian defense of Orthodoxy against historicism.  In his time, congregations in Queens and Long Island, with YU rabbi were still called Orthodox. Yeshivish Jews were called Ultra-Orthodox. The term modern Orthodox  (small m) was a term only for the rabbinical intellectuals who embraced modernism, by their own count &#8211; a few score at best. In the late 1970&#8217;s the term was applied to a not very clearly defined sociological group of those who have more modern congregation, graduates of day schools, and orthodox summer camps. By the 1990&#8217;s  there was a serious mess of terminology.</p>
<p>Rabbi Wurzburger saw a need to affirm a modern philosophic Orthodoxy. He was active in interfaith work and was committed to an ethical Judiasm that aspires to answer to higher &#8220;covenantal imperatives,&#8221; greater than a formalist reading of the legal canon.</p>
<p>I wrote a long article but think someone out there should use my article to write for him an appropriate wikipedia article.</p>
<p>Here it is:  <a title="A Tiny but Articulate Minority- Walter Wurzbuger by Alan Brill" href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/wurzburger-article.pdf">A Tiny but Articulate Minority- The Thought of Rabbi Walter Wurzbuger by Alan Brill</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a review in this week&#8217;s Forward. My original title was the one on this blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Everything Is God: The Path of Nondual Judaism </strong>By Jay Michaelson<em><br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Jay Michaelson is well known to readers of the Forward for his column, “The Polymath,” a title well chosen to mitigate the frequent changes in his byline, which varied from dot-com software designer, to doctoral student in Jewish mysticism, to lawyer, to environmentalist, to poet, to GBLT activist. As one of the founders of the journal Zeek, Michaelson was one of the instrumental creators of the new Jewish culture — the hip mixture of ironic and post-ironic aesthetic gestures — which moved Jewish culture beyond baby boomer concerns. Michaelson’s theology is as diverse as his former bylines and reflects the same shift to the values of the new Jewish culture.</p>
<p>In this new book, “Everything Is God: The Path of Nondual Judaism,” Michaelson’s regular stream of post-secular book reviews provided the framework to work out his own popular theology, and the book reflects that history, capturing his spiritual insights in edgy 1,000-word bursts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Skipping to the ending</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, Michaelson does not start his reader on the long journey of transformation, nor does the book speak from a point of nonduality, as the Hasidic or Eastern religious works do. Instead, we listen to his breakneck embrace of the nondual world: Talking breathlessly about meditation, creating myriad perspectives on oneness and meeting everyone there is to meet upon the path.</p>
<p>The book reminds me most of the 1960s wandering independent polymath Alan Watts — an earlier articulate proponent of Asian philosophies of nonduality. Watts scandalized his straight-laced Western audience by preaching an eclectic nonduality outside of organized religion; however, Watts is more famous for antagonizing the world’s leading Zen teachers by claiming that Zen has little to do with sitting but is in fact a path of nonduality justifying “sheer caprice in art, literature, and life” — a spirituality offering a radical new worldview articulated in jazz rhythms rather than in the contemplative flavor of Zen. Like Watts, Michaelson sometimes makes grand pronouncements based entirely on his own experience.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/115572/" target="_self">Read the entire review here</a></p>
<p>Here was my original penultimate paragraph that was removed to keep to the word count and to remain focused on the book under review.</p>
<blockquote><p>As I once waited backstage, before appearing on a Jewish cable TV show to discuss Judaism and Buddhism, a senior Orthodox rabbi from a staid upper crust synagogue, seeking to make conversation on my topic, confided to me how he read Alan Watts as a youth and gained many lessons that stuck with him through out life. The Rabbi never again dabbled in any other Asian thought or non-dualistic thinking, but the brief exposure to Watt’s Beat-Zen offered many lifelong tools for thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the book is available online as articles at Zeek, The Forward, Jewcy, Reality Sandwitch.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lawrence Hoffman &#8230;  envisions people taking advantage of a wide menu of synagogue offerings according to their individual tastes, much as they shop for clothes (<em>Rethinking Synagogues</em>, pp. 174-175).  If we ask for no sense of shared responsibility, then aren’t we treating people, in essence, as spiritual consumers? Aren’t we inviting them, in effect, to “buy” spiritual experiences?</p></blockquote>

<p>On Sunday nights, I am glued to my TV watching the hit show Mad Men The show ostensively focuses on an ad agency in 1962 portraying the rise of advertising and consumer culture in America. But the real story is the sense of falling and anxiety that occurred when the certainties of the nineteen fifties gave way to the individualism of the 1960’s. I find that this post “ <span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;">Beyond Spiritual Consumerism. . . Or Not</span>” confuses the plot with the real story.</p>
<div style="margin:0;"><strong> </strong></div>
<div style="margin:0;">In the 1950’s people learned to accept culturally constructed institutions and model ideal attitudes whose expectations might not have been experienced privately. In the 1960’s people started to seek their own individual directions and overcome the split between the institutional and the personal. They moved from dwelling to seeking. By the 1980’s and 1990’s this individualism became the norm.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">Jews aspired to a collective idea of peoplehood and accepted institutional attitudes toward Judaism, family life, and society. Mordechai Kaplan’s important re-evaluation of Judaism was based on the descriptive ideas of Durkheim in which individuals express themselves in collectives. But what comes after Durkheim, and the evident decline in self-definition through Jewish institutions?</div>
<div style="margin:0;">Charles Taylor in his recent work <em>A Secular Age</em> points out that Durkheim’s approach — in which individuals expressed themselves in collectives and institutions — no longer holds true in its original meaning. Religion today, Taylor argues, can be found in “the continuing multiplication of new options, religious, spiritual, and anti-religious, which individuals seize on in order to make sense of their lives.” Taylor stresses the complex ways in which religion is now even more a part of our daily lives, and the importance of a multiplicity of practices and interpretations to deal with this variety.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">In the post –Durkheim reality described by Taylor, we need to reframe the issue away from peoplehood to individual meanings and smaller social units, in short, religion in the human life.  We need to think in terms of changes based on the small changes of meanings and moral orders.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">Take, for example, the variety of religious experiences and moral orders that could be found among the pews in a single congregation on Yom Kippur 2009. We will find people from whom Judaism is of varying importance in their daily lives, but for whom the content of that Judaism is different and varying. There will be those who adhere to old-time theology, those for whom Judaism is about being a politically conservative ADL supporter, those who are progressive, another who stresses social action, another who understands reality using 12-step language, and another who eclectically combines Chabad, <em>feng shui</em>, and Buddhist spirituality, those who are uplifted through art, and even moral majority Jews who embrace Judaism for its strong “family values.” There are dozens of other Jewish moral orders, no congregation has even half of them. People choose to obligate themselves to these diverse meanings because they help make sense of their lives.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">Recently, many analysts of the Jewish community have picked up the phrase “spiritual marketplace” (first used a generation ago) and proceed to compare the Jewish choices made by today’s Jew to the choice of a “grande soy latte” in Starbucks – a simile implying a degree of pampering and meaningless luxuries. Viewing Jews making life decisions as Starbucks customers, their policy proposals emphasize the need to reach younger Jews through better marketing. However, religious choices, as Robert Wuthnow has stressed, reflect an attempt to create meaningful lives and a structure of moral orders. Multiple choices do not lead to the banal market pluralism, but to a variety of constructed finite religious identities.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">When entering the contemporary spiritual landscape, the contemporary Jew experiences not three or four denominations, but dozens of flavors. Synagogues and Jewish organization become specialized into single products for specialized audiences. So of course, people enjoy the Synaplex model because it gives them a possibility, a chance, to experience what they find meaningful. If they are lucky, they can find their personal vision validated.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">To return to the original issue of equating choice with consumer choice, we need to look at moral orders and meanings created.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">Seekers, as Wuthnow categorized them, are not a single category but are many approaches and many moral orders. While some still seek naturalism, other seekers embrace traditional concepts of God. The literature in the field of spirituality divides spirituality into anywhere between four to ten different types. Many of the books from Alban Institute place the number at four.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">Rabbis need to know that these different types of spirituality are not interchangeable and that congregants are not choosing them just for consumerist variety. Some congregants seeking certain forms of spirituality are actually repelled by some of the others. No one congregation can attempt all of the current varieties of spirituality. No Rabbi can offer all of them. But there is shopping because there in fact several different unique types of spirituality, each with their own sense of meaning, not because they have internalized the marketplace values.</div>
<div style="margin:0;">The blog post asked “If we ask for no sense of shared responsibility, then aren’t we treating people, in essence, as spiritual consumers?”</div>
<div style="margin:0;">The answer is no!  Judaism is capacious and has the possibility of many meanings constructed and many moral orders formed. That is, unless, the vision is to return the community to the 1950’s. We watch Mad Men to remind ourselves how much we have changed.</div>
