										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Menachem Wecker posted at <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/iconia/2011/01/ari_gordon.html">his Iconia Blog</a> a fascinating interview with Ari Gordon about art and interfaith.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Getting beyond the Jewish &#8220;deer in the headlights&#8221; reaction to images of Jesu</strong>s<br />
Although he grew up in an Orthodox Jewish community in Philadelphia and completed his undergraduate studies at the Orthodox Jewish school Yeshiva University, one of Ari Gordon&#8217;s favorite paintings is a crucifixion &#8212; Marc Chagall&#8217;s White Crucifixion to be exact.</p>
<p>Gordon, who is special advisor for inter-religious and intergroup relations at the American Jewish Committee, sees &#8220;Jewish features&#8221; and a Jewish prayer shawl (tallit) &#8212; a stand-in for the typical loin cloth &#8212; in Chagall&#8217;s Jesus, and he says the scene is set in modern Germany, &#8220;surrounded by mini-scenes portraying the suffering of Jews in Chagall&#8217;s own time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this painting because it crosses boundaries to great effect,&#8221; Gordon says. &#8220;Jesus has always been a point of fear and confusion for Jews; he is a suffering Jew, who somehow led to many centuries of suffering for his people. As a result, most Jews (to this day) when confronted with images of or conversations about Jesus react like a deer in headlights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chagall&#8217;s work, particularly the crucifixion, draws &#8220;comfort, irony and dialogue,&#8221; according to Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the image of a crucified Christ, Chagall was able to find a model to best capture the Jewish martyrdom he perceived around him,&#8221; he says. &#8220;At the same time, the irony of using a Christian symbol that had been the cause of much Jewish persecution over the years was not lost on the artist. Chagall seems to have painted White Crucifixion as a way of crying out to Christians about the situation of Jews in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>By juxtaposing Jewish and Christian scenes, Chagall not only captured centuries of polemics, but also opened &#8220;a window for inter-religious dialogue for the painting&#8217;s viewers,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>According to Gordon, who holds a master of theological studies from Harvard focused on Islamic-Jewish comparative studies, art is an &#8220;under-utilized&#8221; tool in interfaith relations, &#8220;which tends to focus more exclusively on political or theological matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Religions are cultures that cannot be restricted simply to politics and theology,&#8221; he says, &#8220;The arts &#8212; like ritual, food, language and literature &#8212; have always been essential venues for religious expression. To ignore the demonstrative and often innovative religious sentiments manifest through the arts is to lose the opportunity to understand our partners&#8217; lives away from the negotiation table and outside of the conference room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Art in the service of interfaith dialogue also offers a unique scope &#8212; &#8220;simultaneously universal and particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art can take a religion&#8217;s particular narratives, expressions and beliefs and make them universally accessible,&#8221; Gordon says. &#8220;Religious art can be a fruitful tool for dialogue that welcomes all to the table without sacrificing individual religious identities in the process.&#8221;</p>
