										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of Kalir, piyyutim, repentance, and angelology, when Prof. Isadore Twersky was having conferences on the 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries at Harvard, an academic friend suggested that we need conferences on the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> centuries. The world of Pirke deRabbi, Midrash Mishlei, Yannai, the start of the Baghdad Gaonate and Alphabet of Ben-Sira. A world that is very dissimilar the world of the Tannaim and Babylonian Talmud. This is the world of anthropomorphism, and corporeality, and the texts that the Jewish philosophers were uncomfortable with accepting.</p>
<p>So I was glad to see that a new book in the library- Rachael <em>Anisfeld</em><em>,:</em> Sustain Me With <em>Raisin</em>-Cakes: Pesikta deRav Kahana and the Popularization of Rabbinic Judaism. The book is literary-historical and not theological. I will leave it to the Talmudists to evaluate its value for the study of rabbinics.</p>
<p>She shows how Leviticus Rabbah and Pesikta deRav Kahana (PRK) are not the same as Tannaic Midrash. (The book should have also had Leviticus Rabbah in the title.)</p>
<p>She uses as her example that the content shows a God who is more intimate with humans, and shows a special indulgence for the people Israel. For example, repentance is about God moving from his seat of judgment to his seat of mercy and less about personal repentance. Even when repentance is discussed, God does everything in his power to exonerate Israel.</p>
<p>The homilies are in a personal and familial voice  – less exegetical</p>
<p>Since the book is literary, it does not develop these themes. There is still much to gain for a theological reader from Neusner’s volume on PRK and<strong> </strong>Arthur Marmorstein<strong> </strong><em>Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God.</em></p>
<p>She has a chart on the difference in technical terms between Tannaic midrash and Amoraic midrash. Some of the striking numbers are</p>
<p>Talmud lomar “Scripture teaches” 4504 times in Tannaic Midrash to 13 times in amoraic midrah. They are not directly interpreting Scripture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, phrases of direct communication by God increase.  There is knowledge from speaking in Gods name and directly invoking God. “The Holy One Blessed be He said” 36  in tannaic to 343 in amoraic.</p>
<p>The book does not offer an overview of the many other themes in PRK such as the longing to rebuild temple, visions of the end of days, revenge on the gentiles, and God himself needing to be saved</p>
<p>Hence, I am looking forward to reading the following article when the Fishbane Festschrift arrives in the library.</p>
<blockquote><p>Marc Hirshman, “Yearning for intimacy: <em>Pesikta d&#8217;Rav Kahana</em> and the Temple”</p>
<p>pp. 135-146(12) Scriptural Exegesis: The Shapes of Culture and the Religious Imagination: Essays in Honour of Michael Fishbane</p>
<p>This chapter examines the ambience of the <em>Pesikta d&#8217;Rav Kahana</em> and its objectives by paying close attention to some of the Greek loanwords it uses and, more generally, to the nature of the language it employs in parables when speaking of the temple and the degree of intimacy indicated between God and Israel. The <em>Pesikta d&#8217;Rav Kahana</em> throbs with a longing for God&#8217;s presence in the temple. The longing for restoration is accompanied by a strong desire for retribution on the nations of the world, a motif that is a staple of most, if not all, of the <em>piskaot</em>. The king parables are employed to indicate God&#8217;s desire for a place (<em>papilion</em>) where intimacy with Israel is assured and secure. God secures a place among the Jewish elders, abandoning the angels above (<em>sunkleten</em>), in order to guide the discussion of calendar, the heart of the Pesikta&#8217;s concern.</p></blockquote>
