										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning of the web era, Haaretz still commissioned academic Judaica articles before every Jewish holiday. They made great printouts to take to shul.</p>
<p>In 2002, Yosef Yahalom wrote a concise article showing that the piyyut is originally a conclusion to a piyyut by YannaiÂ  later attached to Kalir and was not written by R. Amnon in Ashkenaz.</p>
<blockquote><p>The piyyut, or sacred poem, &#8220;Unetaneh tokef kedushat hayom&#8221; (&#8220;Let us recount the power of the holiness of this day&#8221;), is one of the central and most thrilling texts in the liturgy of the High Holy Days.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This text was written by Yanai&#8217;s most celebrated student, Elazar Hakalir.</p></blockquote>
<p>A year later Hananel Mack wrote a follow up article, less certain which Byzantium author wrote the poet. But Mack shows that the vision of the angels themselves being judged is a theme of Kedusha, so the piyyut was originally a ending poem to a kedushah piyyut.</p>
<blockquote><p>Additional corroboration for the claim that the liturgical poem `Unetaneh Tokef&#8217; was written during the period of Yanai and Elazar Hakalir and not, as tradition says, by Rabbi Amnon of Mainz.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>However, here we hear for the first time of the fate shared by heavenly beings and humans, who are all judged on Judgment Day &#8211; that is, on Rosh Hashanah and, apparently, also on Yom Kippur, which is also a judgment day and is also mentioned in the body of the piyyut.</p></blockquote>
<p>This topic is a reminder that we do not have a good book on the theology of Judiasm 600-1100, the great age of Piyyut and Aggadic Midrash.</p>

<p>Update 2010- Haaretz is no longer giving free access to the articles.</p>
