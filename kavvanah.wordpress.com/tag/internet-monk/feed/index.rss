										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of those who were raised as Evangelical in the recent Great Awakening of Religion are not returning to the Evangelical Faith of their parents. Statistics vary from 25%-80%. The Great return to religion is winding down.&nbsp; Those raised with an intense Evangelical faith don&#8217;t naturally blend back into&nbsp; mainline liberal Churches. They are specifically ex-evangelicals who have adapted liberal position.</p>
<p>So too in American Judaism, despite the triumphalism of orthodoxy Judiasm in the last quarter century and phony online statistics &#8211; Orthodoxy is witnessing similar phenomena.&nbsp; We also have a large number of people who are ex-Orthodox, not believing in what they were taught, and adopting liberal positions but that does not mean they are comfortable with liberal Judiasm. Read the following and ask yourself: <b>how many of them also apply to someone distancing him/herself from his/her Orthodox upbringing?</b> <b>How many are being argued on the Jewish blogs?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-evangelical"><b>Post-evangelicalism</b></a> is a term used to describe former adherents of Evangelicalism. includes a variety of people who have distanced themselves from mainstream evangelical Christianity for theological, political, or cultural reasons. Most who describe themselves as post-evangelical are still adherents of the Christian faith in some form.</p>
<p>Post-evangelical critiques of the evangelical church concern include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individualism and lack of theological depth</li>
<li>Anti-intellectualism</li>
<li>Narrow or excessively partisan political views</li>
<li>Lack of engagement in art, media, and society</li>
<li>Materialism and consumerism</li>
<li>Insensitivity toward homosexuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Christianity Today explains that post-evangelicals have become willingly disassociated with the mainstream evangelical belief system over difficulties with any combination of at least the following issues:</p>
<p>1. Questions over Biblical innerrancy. Questions may relate to the Biblical record of history, contradictions between scientific and scriptural explanations of the nature of the Universe and humanity (e.g., the origin of the Universe, homosexuality) or the discrepancies in descriptions of the personality of God in the different books of the Bible. Shrouding these issues, are are how the cultural understandings and lingustical limitations of the written word have influenced the way Scripture has been recorded and handed down throughout the ages.</p>
<p>2 The moral failure of prominent evangelical leaders. Such failure has cast doubt over the entire evangelical movement.</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;Many post-evangelicals have come of age during times of increasing multi-cultural awareness in Western society. They are presented with the educational lessons of the validity of all cultures and necessity for a pluralistic world-view.</p>
<p>Publications identifying as post-evangelical include the blog <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/">Internet Monk </a></p></blockquote>
<p>Now that was fun. How many sounded familiar? Any to add in the Jewish case?&nbsp;Do you think they have played themselves out in the same way in the Jewish community?</p>
<p>h/t &#8211;Here&nbsp; is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/three-questions-about-post-evangelicalism">recent blog post </a>from the blog InternetMonk on the topic.</p>
