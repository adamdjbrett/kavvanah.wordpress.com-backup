										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If I forget thee, Jerusalem,</strong><br />
Then let my right be forgotten.<br />
Let my right be forgotten, and my left remember.<br />
Let my left remember, and your right close<br />
And your mouth open near the gate.</p>
<p>I shall remember Jerusalem<br />
And forget the forest &#8212; my love will remember,<br />
Will open her hair, will close my window,<br />
will forget my right,<br />
Will forget my left.</p>
<p>If the west wind does not come<br />
I&#8217;ll never forgive the walls,<br />
Or the sea, or myself.<br />
Should my right forget<br />
My left shall forgive,<br />
I shall forget all water,<br />
I shall forget my mother.</p>
<p>If I forget thee, Jerusalem,<br />
Let my blood be forgotten.<br />
I shall touch your forehead,<br />
Forget my own,<br />
My voice change<br />
For the second and last time<br />
To the most terrible of voices &#8212;<br />
Or silence.</p>
<p><strong>Let the memorial hill remember</strong></p>
<p>Let the memorial hill remember instead of me,<br />
that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s here for. Let the par in-memory-of remember,<br />
let the street that&#8217;s-named-for remember,<br />
let the well-known building remember,<br />
let the synagogue that&#8217;s named after God remember<br />
let the rolling Torah scroll remember, let the prayer<br />
for the memory of the dead remember. Let the flags remember<br />
those multicolored shrouds of history: the bodies they wrapped<br />
have long since turned to dust. Let the dust remember.<br />
Let the dung remember at the gate. Let the afterbirth remember.<br />
Let the beasts of the field and birds of the heavens eat and remember.<br />
Let all of them remember so that I can rest.</p>
<p><strong>A Touch of Grace:</strong></p>
<p>At times Jerusalem is a city of knives,<br />
And even the hopes for peace are sharp enough to slice into<br />
The harsh reality and they become dulled or broken.<br />
The church bells try so hard to ring out calm, round tones,<br />
But they become heavy like a pestle pounding on a mortar,<br />
Heavy, muffled, downtrodding voices. And the cantor<br />
And the muezzin try to sing sweetly<br />
But in the end the sharp wail bursts forth:<br />
O Lord, God of us all, The Lord is One<br />
One, one, one, one.<br />
(The Hebrew word for &#8220;one&#8221; also means &#8220;sharp&#8221; in Hebrew)</p>
<p><strong>Love of the Land</strong><br />
by Yehuda Amichai / Translated by Linda Zisquit</p>
<p>And the land is divided<br />
into districts of memory and regions of hope,<br />
and the residents mingle with each other,<br />
like people returning from a wedding<br />
with those returning from a funeral.</p>
<p>And the land isn&#8217;t divided into war zones and peace zones.<br />
And whoever digs a trench against cannon shells,<br />
will return and lie in it with his girl,<br />
if he lives till peace comes.</p>
<p>And the land is pretty.<br />
Even surrounding enemies decorate it<br />
with weapons shining in the sun<br />
like beads on a neck.</p>
<p>And the lands a package-land:<br />
and its well-tied and everything is in it,<br />
and its tightly bound<br />
and the strings sometimes hurt.</p>
<p>The land is very small<br />
and I can contain it inside me.<br />
The erosion of the land also erodes my rest<br />
and the level of the Kinneret is always on my mind.<br />
Therefore I am able to feel it entirely<br />
by shutting an eye: sea-valley-mountain.<br />
And therefore I am able to remember<br />
all that&#8217;s happened in it<br />
at once, like a person remembering<br />
his entire life at the moment of death.</p>
<p><strong>Poem #12 Eicha</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;How doth the city sit solitary,&#8221; the prophet<br />
lamented over Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If Jerusalem is a woman, does she know desire?<br />
When she cries out, is it from pleasure<br />
or pain? What is the secret of her appeal?<br />
When does she open her gates willingly and when is it rape?</p>
<p>All her lovers abandon her, leaving her<br />
with the wages of love necklaces earrings,<br />
towers and houses of prayer<br />
in the English, Italian, Russian, Greek, Arab styles,<br />
wood and stone, turrets and gables, wrought-iron gates,<br />
rings of gold and silver, riots of color. They all give her<br />
something to remember her by, then abandon her.</p>
<p>I would have liked to talk to her again, but I lost her<br />
among the dancers. Dance is total abandon.<br />
Jerusalem sees only the skies above her<br />
and whoever sees only the skies above&#8211;not<br />
the face of her lover&#8211;truly does lie solitary,<br />
sit solitary, stand solitary, and dance all alone.</p>
<p><strong>“Songs of Zion the Beautiful #21”</strong></p>
<p>Jerusalem’s a place where everyone remembers he’s forgotten something<br />
but doesn’t remember what it is.<br />
And for the sake of remembering I wear my father’s face over mine.<br />
This is the city where my dream-containers fill up like a diver’s oxygen tanks.<br />
Its holiness sometimes turns into love.<br />
And the questions that are asked in these hills<br />
are the same as they’ve always been: “Have you<br />
seen my sheep?” “Have you seen my shepherd?”<br />
And the door of my house stands open<br />
like a tomb where someone was resurrected.</p>
