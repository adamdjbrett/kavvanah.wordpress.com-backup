										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interesting book review on questions of authorship as applied to Dante.  The critical theorists have already shown that medievals treated Aristotelian philosophy the way we treat the rules of physics, not something that needs an author. And they showed how some medieval texts were written with the reader in mind- either as images on the side of the page or only giving allusions and letting the reader apply them on his own. Medievals also wrote as a form of revelation, and treated cosmologies as revelatory and they considered the bearers of the scholarly tradition as possessing an immanent truth. Not everyone who wrote was considered an <em>auctores</em>.</p>
<p>This opens up the question of what rabbinic Jewish author were doing? The Geonim and Nahmanides were writing with the a Divine spirit, or at least legal decisions were guided by the Divine. Some Kabbalistic works are seen as transmitting ancient knowledge or ascribed to older figures. And the Guide for the Perplexed is just that, a guide for the reader. But what were the “authors” of Pirkei deRebbe Eliezer  thinking? </p>
<p>To consider the modern issues: Judaism never bought into the idea of the individual author and still has trouble with intellectual property of an author. In many texts, Torah is seen as possessed by the collective or as eternally given. So when a posek writes a teshuvah: Is it his own authorship? Does he write as bearer of a mesorah, like a medieval kabbalist? Is there a revelation granted to the community? We tend to frame these questions using the anachronistic modern contrast of autonomy and authority. We need to ask: what is involved in an act of religious writing? Does one write ex cathedra, with immanent truth, with revelation, or for the reader?</p>
<p>But then it becomes more difficult- what happens when the written opinions of a rabbi are involved in petty squabbles or personal interests or manipulated by politics? Ascoli’s book on Dante  asks that question directly – If Dante claimed to write with revelation then how can he till be involved in his petty squabbles?  What happens when someone writes with immanent divine truth and also acts as an independent agent? </p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=25533">Albert Russell Ascoli.  Dante and the Making of a Modern Author. Cambridge  Cambridge University Press, 2008. Reviewed by Jan G. Soffner (Zentrum Cr Literatur- und Kulturforschung) Published on H-Italy </a>(December, 2009)<br />
<strong><br />
By Which Authority Did Dante Write?</strong></p>
<p>If one happens to talk by chance about Dante&#8217;s fourteenth-century masterpiece _Divine Comedy_, one can observe a strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>Dante seems to misuse God for his political opinions, by letting the divine justice condemn his enemies, and for his personal<br />
pride or arrogance, by having all the best dead poets honor him (see, for instance, Inferno IV, 100-102). Moreover, isn&#8217;t it already quite<br />
presumptuous to &#8220;know&#8221; the divine verdict about everybody who has ever died? All this seems to be even stranger, since this work is<br />
evidently a literary text, not an inspired prophecy like the Revelation. So how could Dante attribute this authority to himself?<br />
And did he attribute this authority to himself after all, or did he &#8220;just&#8221; write fiction?</p>
<p>This suspicion arose as soon as the _poema sacro&#8211;_the &#8220;holy poem,&#8221; as Dante himself calls it (Paradiso XXV, 1)&#8211;was written. Nearly<br />
seven hundred years of &#8220;Dantology&#8221; (to use Robert Harrison&#8217;s brilliantly provocative term)[1] have not convincingly resolved this<br />
doubt. In the fourteenth century cosmological representations in the _Cosmographia_ of BernardusSilvestris (ca. 1084-1178), the _Anticlaudianus_ of Alanus ab Insulis (1120-1202) and the _Tesoretto_ of Brunetto Latini (ca. 1220-94). They read the text either as a spiritual revelation and a dream, despite its literary construction and despite the claim to report a physical journey, or they interpreted it in a &#8220;modern&#8221; way, that is, as a fictional construction, despite the explicit claims of the _Commedia_to be a revelatory work.</p>
<p>Ascoli also has an excellent knowledge notonly of the works of modern theoretical thinkers such as Hannah<br />
Arendt, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Mary Carruthers about literary authorship and authority, but also of the discursive<br />
figurations of _auctores_ available at Dante&#8217;s time. Ascoli starts with an extensive analysis of contemporary concepts of<br />
authorship, and of the manner in which Dante seems to be relating to them as a whole. Ascoli argues that the image of an author stemmed<br />
from the trustworthy _auctoritates_ of the ancient and/or philosophical and theological tradition granting for an immanent<br />
truth to biblical scribes and the true author, who is God. These traditional concepts refer to _auctoritas_ as both an individual and<br />
impersonal power and knowledge. The _auctor_ thereby was not so much a creative agent, but rather a mediating power of knowledge. He was<br />
one worthy of faith and obedience.</p>
<p>Hence Dante, modeled as an individual traveler in the _Divine Comedy_, &#8220;comes, paradoxically, to embody the canons of<br />
impersonal authority&#8221; (p. 20). On the one hand Dante is thereby traditionalist and conservative, on the other, he is also provided<br />
with the &#8220;transgressive desire to appropriate that attribute for himself, for the vernacular, and for &#8216;modernity'&#8221; (p. 20f).</p>
<p>How can a fictional work gain a revelatory truth? Ascoli shows convincingly how Dante assumes the traditional role of an<br />
authoritative author without thereby relating to the pre-existing models of knowledge implied by these kinds of authorship.<br />
The unease of us moderns when confronted with Dante cannot just be about the relation to an ineffable divine Being. Representationalist<br />
modern authors work with a more or less Aristotelian concept of fiction, that is, with a concept of a poetic truth relying on<br />
modeling possibilities and an emotionality that can be addressed playfully and without consequences. However, Dante tells us a<br />
different story </p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a sample of chapter one of <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511380464&amp;ss=exc">Albert Russell Ascoli.  Dante and the Making of a Modern Author.</a><br />
Can we move beyond the dichotomies of authority/autonomy or submission/freedom and explain the act of religious writing or studying Torah or acting as a rabbi in terms of how they define authorship or role of the self in the process? </p>
