										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just received an email that Drisha will be screening and discussing the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries at 4pm on Tisha beAv. I take this as another indication of our relating to God as a therapeutic deity.</p>
<p>In the 1970&#8217;s Conservative congregations spoke of Jewish history and the Holocaust on Tisha Be-av. Reading of Josephus and Ghetto diaries. During this time period, Rav Soloveitchik spoke of the ontic catastrophe of the destruction of the Temple and the existential state of acquiring emotions in a case of &#8220;old mourning&#8221; and turned it into a day of shiurim on mourning and the mikdash.<br />
Flashy Rabbis gave lectures on &#8220;why do we still mourn now that we have a state of Israel?&#8221;</p>
<p>By the 1990&#8217;s Centrist Orthodoxy used the talks of Rav Soloveitchik to speak of Jewish History and the Holocaust, or discussing the halakhot of the land of Israel. Holocaust films were shown and protests are held at the UN and embassies. The halakhic God of <em>Lonely Man of Faith</em> gave way to a God of History, Land, and War.<br />
On the more yeshivish side, there are lectures on hastening the geulah- either through not talking lashon hara or not doing any of the activities that hasten it. </p>
<p>In the last few years, there has been a shift to the brokenness of the world. Renewal announcements ask: How do we deal with the brokenness, trauma, and injustice in the world. Yeshivish announcements offer sessions on the destruction in our lives and restoring family and teens in trouble. And now Drisha is leading a discussion about <em>Wild Strawberries</em>, a movie in which the protagonist a retired medical professor sees his life as loveless and without meaning. He is haunted by memories, brought on by dreams and by people he meets, about the chances for love, family, and forgiveness that he messed up. Tisha Be-Av is a chance to undo psychic damage.</p>
<p>One path that is not being continued is the Tisha BeAv rally held several years ago in Jerusalem in which Rabbis Lichtenstein, Cherlow, Lau, and others as an occasion for justice. They denounced the lack of in Israel of worker&#8217;s rights,  the human trafficking, the oppression of the poor, of the Arab other, of unfair business practices. The event did not have continuity. (Can someone send me the links from Haaretz, Ynet or the speeches?)<br />
Rabbi SR Hirsch also emphasized the ethical since the prophets denounced Israel for its immorality.</p>
<p>As a side topic- <a href="http://rebshlomo.org/transcriptions/tisha-bav-begging-g-d-for-intimacy/">Here is Reb Shlomo from 1992</a> asking for intimacy with God, to heal from the pain of the Holocaust, to rebuild the Temple. It&#8217;s longing is palpable.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is possible to do everything G-d wants you to do and not to be intimate with G-d. You know, beautiful friends, Mount Sinai is where G-d told us what to do. But Jerusalem, the Holy Temple, is where we are intimate with G-d. The Holy Temple is the headquarters for being close to G-d and to each other. But when the house is destroyed, there is no place to be intimate anymore. And gevalt! Are we longing and crying to be intimate with G-d, with every Jew, with every word of the Torah, and, one day, with the whole world…On Tisha b’Av the Messiah comes. On Tisha b’Av until the Six Million you only heard the sound of the destruction of the Temple; you could not hear the footsteps of the Messiah. Today, the voice of destruction gets further and further away, the voice of the coming of the Messiah gets closer and closer. Let it be this year that the whole world will be fixed and G-d’s holy intimacy comes back into the world and into our lives. You know, beautiful friends, I’m so proud of our moshav and our shul because they are filled with prayers, with so much dancing and joy, but also with so many tears begging G-d for intimacy with every word of the Torah with every Jew, with every human being, with all of nature. I have a feeling it will be this year. </p></blockquote>
<p>Shlomo offers an undifferentiated healing love- primordial and oceanic.<br />
Viewing <strong>Wild Strawberries</strong> offers self-scrutiny of one&#8217;s wrong choices and how does one let go of hindrances that prevent healing. One sees that one&#8217;s choices are the cause of one&#8217;s meaninglessness, therefore a person needs to take responsibility, a therapeutic mussar.</p>
<p>Updated- One week later Drisha sent out an announcement that they will be showing a Holocaust movie and not Wild Strawberries. </p>
