										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi  (1513-1585), rabbi in Egypt, Italy and Poland, was a rational thinker and major influence in his era. He wrote an important Biblical commentary and defended the traditional medieval rationalism against Maharal. The following passage played a role in subsequent early modern legal discussions and seems to have been forgotten in twentieth century discussions. Ashkenazi removes his, and our, current gentiles from the curse.</p>
<p><strong>“Pour out thy wrath upon the nations”</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the Gentiles among whom we are exiled under their protection have thought that God forbid we are cursing them. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It only applies to the nations that do not know Him, that deny the Exodus from Egypt because they don’t accept the miracles and wonders. It is quite clear that the Gentiles among whom we are exiled all know about the Exodus and believe in it, and know its details…We only curse the idol worshipers who don’t believe in creation and who destroyed the Temple, not the nations who became Edom and Ishmael (Christianity and Islam) because they were still not created…But now our Gentiles and the Ishmaelites know God, and acknowledge the Exodus, forefend for us to curse them from our religion.<br />
And when we do curse those who afflict us and unjustly persecute us, that curse is not from our religion, forefend, but as a person who curses one who afflicts another…<br />
Our holy Torah announces this in the name of the head of the faithful [Abraham] that God does not desire this, as it is written, “Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?” And the master of the prophets [Genesis 18:23] said, “One person will sin and the whole community should be cut off?” And from the writings it is clarified that we are not allowed from our religion to curse nations that acknowledge the Exodus from Egypt and know God even if they have not received the Torah…<br />
That is why it was not permitted for Israel to conquer the land of Canaan until after the Exodus, that even after they know about God they did not believe or accept…. </p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi Ashkenazi acknowledges that Gentiles accept God, creation and even the providential Exodus story. Ashkenazi draws a distinction between the negative attitude toward Gentiles in the Talmud and the attitude toward contemporary Christians by stating that Gentiles at the time of the Temple were idolaters without a belief in God. He further distances himself from prior teachings of contempt by stating that the curses that the Midrash heaps upon Rome have no connection to the later nations of Edom.  Ashkenazi proclaims that Jews do not curse others. Even when Christians persecute Jews, the persecution stems not from their religion but from unfortunate occurrences between people. One cannot hold a people accountable for the injustice of some of them, and certainly one cannot hold their religion responsible for the injustice committed by certain members of it. </p>
<p>Ashkenazi also explains the four sons as the wise son is Isaac, the wicked son is Christianity, the simple son is Jacob, and the son that does not know how to ask is Islam. There is a recent dissertation written under the direction of Menachem Kellner on Ashkenazi, Neta Ecker, Universalism in the Thought of Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi” Unpublished Dissertation Haifa University 2010)</p>
<p>The importance of this passage of Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi is that it is quoted as a source text by R. Moshe Rivkes in the eighteenth-century as a general halakhah. </p>
<p><em>The rabbis of the Talmud meant by the term ‘idolaters’ the pagans who lived in their time, who worshipped the stars and the constellations and did not believe in the Exodus from Egypt and in the creation of the world out of nothing. But the nations under whose benevolent shadow we, the Jewish nation, are exiled and are dispersed among them, they do believe in the creation of the world out of nothing and the Exodus from Egypt and in the essentials of faith, and their whole intention is toward the Maker of heaven and earth, as other authorities have written…<br />
So rather than a prohibition not to save them [if they were idolaters],  on the contrary, we are required to pray for their welfare <strong>as Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi wrote at length on the passage  from the Passover haggadah “Pour out thy Wrath.”</strong> King David prayed to God to pour out his wrath on the idolater who did not believe in creation from nothing or the signs and wonders that God performed for us in Egypt and at the giving of the Torah. The nations<br />
In whose shadow we live and under whose wings we are protected do believe in all of this. Therefore, we are always required to pray for the welfare and success of the kingdom and the ministers, in all their provinces. Indeed, Maimonides ruled according to Rabbi Joshua, that the pious of the nations have a portion in the world to come. (Be&#8217;er haGolah to Hoshen Mishpat 425:5) </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago before the computerized library age, I was asked to check if a certain library in Europe possibly had a copy of a small book &#8220;Shefokh Ahavatkha&#8221; by Chaim Bloch, the famous Neturei Karta forger. Bloch claimed in another work that he wrote such work and it provided evidence for a medieval tradition of &#8220;Pour out thy Love upon the nations.&#8221; Since he forged the Anti-Zionist letters and was involved in the Kherson forgeries, it was more of a wild goose chase. What is interesting is that in recent years both the Mekhon Hartman Haggadah and the Midrasha Oranim include the forged version in their haggadot, with a very mild caveat that &#8220;scholars debate the issue.&#8221; They like the universal sentiment regardless of its source. To see it in the Hartman&#8217;s Haggadah see pages 142-143 in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Different-Night-Family-Participation-Haggadah/dp/0966474007#reader_0966474007">A Different Night.</a></p>
<p>This year I noticed that in 2009 an Israeli paper helped spread the false story as true, So I was gratified to see there is a <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Passover/The_Seder/Conducting_a_Seder/After_the_Meal/Elijah.shtml">nice article by Rabbi David Golinkin on the topic.</a> Golinkin also has a nice discussion of the custom of dressing up a Elijah, but his discussion of the forged Maharal Haggadah and the prayer for salvation did not catch that one of prime reasons for the forged Maharal Haggadah was to spread the Kotzker-Izbitz practice of drinking a fifth cup.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Hatza&#8217;ah L&#8217;Seder, a new Israeli Haggadah published by the staff of the Midrasha at Oranim Teachers&#8217; College in 2000, the following addition appears after the three traditional Shefokh verses:</p>
<p>A piyyut which exhibits a different attitude to non-Jews (found in a Haggadah manuscript from the early 16th century):</p>
<p>Pour out your love on the nations who know You<br />
And on kingdoms who call Your name.<br />
For the good which they do for the seed of Jacob<br />
And they shield Your people Israel from their enemies.<br />
May they merit to see the good of Your chosen}<br />
And to rejoice in the joy of Your nation.</p>
<p>This prayer was first published by the bibliographer Naftali Ben-Menahem in 1963. It was supposedly discovered by Rabbi Hayyim Bloch (1881-ca. 1970) in a beautiful manuscript on parchment from the estate of Rabbi Shimshon Wertheimer (1658-1724).</p>
<p>The Haggadah was supposed to have been edited in Worms in 1521 by &#8220;Yehudah b&#8221;r Yekutiel, the grandson of Rashi&#8221;, but the manuscript was lost during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>However, a number of scholars have pointed our that this prayer was probably invented by Hayyim Bloch himself, who was born in Galicia and later moved to Vienna (ca. 1917) and New York (1939). He was one of the rabbis who published the Kherson letters attributed to the Besht and his disciples, which later turned out to be forgeries. He also published a letter from the Maharal of Prague, whose authenticity was already disproved by Gershom Scholem.</p>
<p>Finally, from 1959-1965 he published three volumes containing over 300 letters of great rabbis opposed to Zionism, but Rabbi Shemuel Hacohen Weingarten has proved that these &#8220;letters&#8221; were invented by Rabbi Bloch himself. Therefore, we may assume that &#8220;Shefokh Ahavatkha&#8221; was not composed in Worms in 1521, but rather by Rabbi Hayyim Bloch ca. 1963.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>On the other hand, the traditions of connecting Miriam to the Seder are traditional as are customs connecting Bitya to the Seder.</strong> <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3238942,00.html">From an article in Ynet in 2006.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The most basic practice was a piece of fish placed on the Seder plate to commemorate Miriam. </p>
<p>We have two cooked foods on the seder table – an egg and a shank bone.The Talmud explains this as reflecting the holiday&#8217;s two sacrifices, the special Paschal lamb and the general holiday offering.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that the number of dishes at the seder wasn&#8217;t fixed.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sherira Gaon of 10th-century Babylon noted a custom of putting three foods on the plate.<br />
&#8220;Those three cooked foods are fish, meat, and an egg corresponding to the foods that Israel will eat in the Time to Come; fish corresponding to Leviathan, egg to Ziz (an enormous mythic and fabulous bird), meat corresponding to wild bull.&#8221; The foods symbolizes the mythic creatures from the realms of sea, air and land that will be eaten in the Meal of the Righteous in the Messianic times.</p>
<p>A second reason offered by R. Sherira , however, is one that resonates more strongly with our generation: &#8220;There are those who put an additional cooked food in memory of Miriam, as it says, &#8220;And I sent before you Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam&#8221; (Micah 6, 4). According to this, Miriam and the role she fulfilled in the redemption from Egypt is represented by the third cooked food on the seder table.</p>
<p>Another rabbi cognizant of the importance of women to the Passover story was Rabbi Abraham Grate of Prague. His 1708 Haggadah commentary explained several seder rituals, including the initial hand washing, as referring to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter Bitya and her rescue of Moses from the Nile.</p>
<p>And if these proto-feminist commentaries are from relatively forgotten sources, how to explain the fact that a basic interpretation of haroset revolves around women – and almost nobody knows it? According to the Talmud, haroset is in memory of the apple tree, and Rashi in his commentary makes reference to the midrash in which, the women would go to their working husbands and would conceive children between the fields. When the women were ready to give birth, they would leave their homes out of fear of the Egyptians. They would lie underneath the apple trees and give birth. Apple haroset, then, is about the fact that the Jewish women did not lose hope in those difficult times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update- It turns out that Jonathan Sacks also has the pc version of &#8220;pour out your love.&#8221; but he puts it below the line as an &#8220;there is a manuscript.&#8221; The Tabori JPS haggadah places this version in the introduction</p>
<p>The official source is Heichal l&#8217;divrei chakhamim upithgameihem (1948) where Bloch adduces this quote, and in the extensive footnote<br />
says he published a reproduction of this page-and the shaar of the manuscript in his fictitious book <em>Der Judenhas.</em> <a href="http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33532&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=590&amp;hilite=">Here is the source </a> Look at both pages 591 and 592.</p>
