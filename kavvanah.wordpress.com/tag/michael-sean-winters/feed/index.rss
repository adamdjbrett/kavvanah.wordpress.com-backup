										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Benedict of the Week</p>
<p>David Nirenberg a Jewish professor of (Jewish) history and social thought at the University  of Chicago offers a review in the TNR of Benedict&#8217;s recent encyclical &#8220;Caritas in Veritate: On Integral Human Development in Charity and Truth.&#8221; He likes the message of love over market values, but asks: Why does it have to be framed as Catholic and not universal?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Benedict&#8217;s teaching differs</strong> from that of his predecessors in at least two important ways. The first is evident in the key term in his analysis: &#8220;love,&#8221; rather than &#8220;justice,&#8221; &#8220;natural law,&#8221; or &#8220;human reason,&#8221; the terms that were favored by some of his predecessors</p>
<p>As Wal-Mart shoppers, for example, we must divide our attention between 1) a self-interest in the lowest possible price for whatever object we desire; and 2) the needs of that object&#8217;s producers, of the environment in and from which it was made, and of the moral and fiscal balance of global trade (hence &#8220;consumers should be continually educated regarding their daily role, which can be exercised with respect for moral principles without diminishing the intrinsic economic rationality of the act of purchasing&#8221;); and 3) an openness to the loving &#8220;spirit of the gift.&#8221; Benedict is not simply suggesting a moral yardstick for the marketplace. He is claiming that every commercial exchange needs to become a loving act modeled on the gratuitous gift of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And only Catholicism, Benedict tells us, can achieve the universal fraternity necessary for authentic community: &#8220;Reason, by itself, is capable of grasping the equality between men and of giving stability to their civic coexistence, but it cannot establish fraternity.</p>
<p>The problem is that Benedict is claiming to offer general answers to global questions that affect people of every faith (and sometimes of no faith), while at the same time insisting that the only possible answer to those questions is Catholicism. Such a suggestion might be a plausible prescription for global peace and development in a Catholic world, but the world is not Catholic.</p>
<p>In a de-secularizing age, and with our faith in self-interest shaken by economic crisis, we should want to draw on the wisdom in that ocean of thought. But if those teachings are to contribute to global &#8220;unity and peace,&#8221; they will have to be taught in a way that seeks to transcend the boundaries of the traditions that produced them. This does not mean, as Benedict fears, that Christianity (or any other religion) must become &#8220;more or less interchangeable with a pool of good sentiments, helpful for social cohesion, but of little relevance,&#8221; or that &#8220;there would no longer be any real place for God in the world.&#8221; Values are not a zero-sum game. God&#8217;s place in the world is not lost when one religion tries to translate some of its truths into helpful good sentiments for those of other or no faith</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/love-and-capitalism" target="_self">Full review</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To which <a href="http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/new-republic-benedict">Michael Sean Winters replies at NCR</a> and at <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/blog/entry.cfm?blog_id=2&amp;id=92581443-3048-741E-3051382429220681">his blog at America</a> that he likes the perspective of the historian but disagrees with the need for universalism</p>
<blockquote><p>his article is so refreshing and so frustrating. On the one hand, he understands that the advent of capitalism and its values represented a “reversal of a millennial moral consensus”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If Nirenberg truly believes that Benedict’s vision is narrowed by his insistence on truth to the point of preventing dialogue, why write a review of the encyclical? Nirenberg’s effort disproves his own claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who is correct?</p>
<p>I think <strong><a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/40247" target="_self">A Jewish Call For Social Justice</a> by </strong>Shmuly Yanklowitz is closer to David Nirenberg in that he discusses social justice without any claims of truth or higher values. But is Jewish pragmatism enough? Is Winters correct that David Nirenberg, and most Jews, are more utilitarian than principled?</p>
