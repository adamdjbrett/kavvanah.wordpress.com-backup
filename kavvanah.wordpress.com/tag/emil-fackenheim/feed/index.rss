										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lord Jonathan Sacks has a style that addresses his Anglican listeners and at the same time addresses his Jewish audience.</p>
<p>Jews generally speak of Torah, avodah, gemilat hasadim; or God, Revelation and olam haba;  or God, Torah, and Israel; and now creation-revelation-redemption. All sets point back to Torah.</p>
<p>Christians use the words witness, mission, covenant, proclamation- all about good news to be brought to the world.   “witness.” in their reading of Israel’s covenant history: means the proclamation and exchange of views held with conviction.</p>
<p>Jonathan Sacks has discussed “witness” as a theological concept in almost all of his books.</p>
<p>In his 1992 <em>Crisis and Covenant, </em>he writes,  “An early rabbinic commentary put the point audaciously: &#8216; &#8220;You are My <em>witnesses</em>, says the Lord, and I am God&#8221; (Isaiah 43:12)” (28) In this work he uses the word the way Emil Fackenhim does, we as witnesses to the destruction of our people in the holocaust and now we give witness by the survival of the Jewish people. Our news to the world is the survival of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>In 1997, he writes “Somehow the Jewish people would be the people in whose daily lives the will of G-d, and in whose collective history the presence of G-d would be particularly evident.  You could look at Jews and see G-d.  In that magnificent phrase in Isaiah: “you are my witnesses, Isaiah 43:10, says G-d and so it happened.” Jews are witnesses to God’s existence.”  This is a Jewish version of the Christian doctrine of the witness; Jews point to God and the original revelation to humanity.</p>
<p>But Jews usually assume the verse talks to Jews about their own redemption   As examples, Rashi explains the witness as Abraham and Jacob testifying to their promise for Israel’s redemption and Radak explains that the prophet testifies that just as Sanherib was destroyed so too all of Israel’s enemies will vanish and Israel will be redeemed. Or the use of it for the haftarah of Bereshit is that just as God created the world he is true to his promise to redeem Israel.</p>
<p>A decade later in his <em>Dignity of Difference</em>, Sacks writes “ But from here on he will focus on one family, and eventually one people, to be his <em>witnesses</em> and bearers of his covenant.”(52) The argument is that undifferentiated pluralism leads to totalitarianism, but God chose a single people, the Jews, to teach the world that each people is unique and that there is a pluralism of diversity of different peoples. But the locution is more Christian, Jews are to witness and bear the covenant of Gods’ designs.</p>
<p>None of the Jewish commentators ad loc interpret it in that direction</p>
<p>In his <em>Heal a Fractured World</em><strong>, </strong>he writes that we witness to God<strong> “</strong>not by seeking to convert those of another faith, but simply by reaching out to embrace the image of God in another human being, by seeing the <strong>image of God in another human being (47) </strong>We have Levinas adapted as an answer to the Christians who seek to convert those of another faith.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Finally, in his recent<strong> </strong>siddur<strong> “</strong>The Jewish people &#8230; have &#8230; been singled out for the most exalted mission ever entrusted to mankind: to be witnesses, in ourselves, to something beyond ourselves: to be God&#8217;s &#8220;signal of transcendence&#8221; in a world in which his presence is often hidden (Siddur p. xxiv).</p>
<p>Jews have Mission to mankind for the presence of God. Hmm… I did a quick online check of the 19 letters to see if Hirsch used it that way, and from my quick check of 19 Letters- Rabbi Hirsch limits witness- Edut to contexts of duty and service of mankind toward God. God is know through the natural order, duty is the Jewish message. I need to check other works of Hirsch and Hertz. But here in Sack&#8217;s prayer book the very knowledge of God is the Jewish mission. Is this more Anglican or Jewish?</p>
<p>Update</p>
<p>I checked the commentary of Dr Mendel Hirsch on the Haftarot (called by most people as the commentary of the father) on the relevant verses in Isaiah. Dr. Hirsch comments that only man has will to act on a higher calling of righteousness. Only through zedek will people realize the nature of reality consisting of freedom from  material slavery in order to live in happiness and freedom. We are a light to the nations when there will be righteousness in the governments. The concept of witness is that the proof of every historical fact rests , on people who were there, on tradition The Jewish people have witnessesed the rise and fall of the nations around them. You were all at the going out from Egypt, which proves a world of providential care. You are witness to your revelation becuase you saw God&#8217;s hand in history.</p>
<p>Hmm..Hirsch does not seem like Sacks. I will check the essays if I get a chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted a more critical approach to Fackenheim than found in the works of Michael Morgan so I turned to David Patterson, Emil Fackenheim Syracuse UP 2008. The book won the 2008 National Jewish Book Award in the category of Modern Jewish Thought, so I assumed it would be more critical.For Patterson, Fackenheim represents a Jewish thinker who affirms the centrality of Torah, yet does not despair of philosophy the way Levinas and Soloveitchik despair. Fackenheim has the tikkun for the darkness at the heart of man as told by Joseph Conrad or Primo Levi. The height of the book for me was when Patterson used the thought of the kabbalist Yitzhak Ginzburgh to explain Hannah Arendt, that too much ego leads to absolute evil.</p>
<p>A different approach is offered by Konstanty Gebert. An observant Polish Jew who was instrumental as an educator and journalist in Solidarity. He now edits Midrasz, a Polish-Jewish monthly.  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/week-in-the-life-konstanty-gebert-journalist--silk-screen-expert-helps-poles-and-jews-heal-ancient-wounds-1101026.html">Interview with him</a></p>
<p>He wrote an article &#8220;Forgetting Amalek&#8221; in Responsibility in Crisis, editor David William Cohen &amp; Michael Kennedy 183-201</p>
<p>Gebert writes that the Torah teaches us to wipe out the memory of Amalek but to always remember their treachery – there is a tension of memory/oblivion</p>
<p>Emil Fackenheim offers the 614<sup>th</sup> commandment. For Gebert, that is like the situation described by Gregory Bateson, a double bind that produces pathological disassociation or a catch -22. If the Shoah makes one turn away from religion then the 614<sup>th</sup> commandment to not give Hitler a posthumous victory by turning away. It means that one is either not true to one’s self or is helping the holocaust. One cannot turn away and if one accepts the call of the Holocaust one disassociates from oneself.</p>
<p>He ponders if Amalek in the Torah, as pure evil, is a construct based on their trauma and not on actual knowledge of Amalakites.  Hating Amalek was an easy thing in their post traumatic stage and the inherited trauma of their immediate descendents.</p>
<p>But, the Babylonians mixed all the tribes in the area through forced relocations. This nullified the commandment to eliminate the Amalek, because at that point the Amalek ceased to exist as a tribe.</p>
<p>Gebert thinks that the university today has a responsibility to help prevent the creation of new Amalek images. We need to separate historic understanding from justifying. We need free debate and intellectual liberty.</p>
<p>Now Amalek’s children themselves need to condemn the evil and work together with the children of victims. We need to remember the evil of Amalek, but the only way to truly wipe out Amalek is through reconciliation. Children of Amalek will come to naught if not helped by the children of the victims.</p>
<p>As a comparison, Avi Sagi sought to justify the Biblical prohibition and explain the moral problem now that we have modern morals, many commentaries on Joshua and Samuel also resort to justification and limiting, but not to reconciliation or the role of the university.  <em>The Punishment of Amalek in Jewish Tradition: Coping with the Moral Problem</em>, Avi Sagi, Harvard Theological Review Vol.87, No.3 (1994)</p>
<p>Reb Shlomo and Reb Zalman taught that we have to turn to simcha to overcome the inner darkness. Then we have to return to Torah in a more open way. <a href="http://rebshlomo.org/transcriptions/the-shoah-the-holocaust-and-helping-to-rebuild-a-new-world/"> Reb Shlomo text.</a></p>
<p>In contrast, the Haredi world, based on a teshuvah of Rabbi Menashe Klein, overcomes the Holocaust by creating a saving remnant of true Jews. They focus only on the true Haredi Jews and limit the validity of conversions including <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1067342.html">Emil Fackenheim’s son</a>.</p>
