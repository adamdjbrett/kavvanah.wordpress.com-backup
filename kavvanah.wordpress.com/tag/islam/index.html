				<p>Continued from <a href="../../2010/07/02/the-gulan-society-as-modern-orthodox-part-one/index.html">part one here.</a> Read part one before you read part II.</p>
<p>I am now asked to comment and tell people what I think of the Gulen movement. The people in the Gulen movement themselves ask me what I think about the movement. Before are some first thoughts – still not organized- still not fact checked- treat it as first impressions. Coming from my knowledge of the Jewish community, I can only evaluate them based on analogy to Jewish parallels.  </p>
<p>My basic questions for evaluating the Islam of the Gulen movement is what will the next generation look like. Even knowing that next generations can turn out the opposite of the prior ones, the vantage point of projection allows evaluation. This is where I am stumped as to how to evaluate my experiences.</p>
<p>Vignette 1 –I am speaking to a 21 year old economic major who describes how the movement took Islam from the folkways and tradition in his small town and made it into a religion. Now the religion of Islam that he follows is by conscious choice and he sees that it can be treated as Turkish-Islamic culture.  This would sound like a religion of self-conscious traditionalism. Their own newspaper quotes the anthropologist Ruth Benedict that &#8220;Our faith in the present dies out long before our faith in the future.&#8221; They are a transition that is still taking place in which the plausibility structure of the past has died and the Gulen movement offers the potential of a future plausibility structure that works.</p>
<p>Vignette  2- I am speaking to an 18 year old recent graduate of the Gulen boarding prep school in CT. He explains to me how Islam was not part of the curriculum but they have prayer and chaplains. He tells me that he is going to study Political Science and pre-law in a major Midwestern mega-university. I wonder how is he going to keep his Islam on a college campus? Will he change due to the influence of the Muslim-chaplain on campus? Will be forced to either assimilate or stake out a more public form of Islam to maintain his identity?  What can I use to evaluate this kid as a success story of Gulen Islam?</p>
<p>Vignette 3- I am speaking to a 50 year old teacher of the movement. Someone shows him a keychain and asks: what is written on it? He says he thinks the first Sura of the Koran but that he cannot translate it and would need to look up its meaning. Since the first Sura is known to every school child who learns Koran-and even to any Jewish studies teacher who has ever taught the second Sura because of its Judiac sources- what do I make of his lack of knowledge of the Koran? it is not hard to remember<br />
In the name of the merciful and compassionate God.<br />
1 Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds,<br />
2 he the merciful, the compassionate,<br />
3 he, the ruler of the day of judgment!<br />
4 Thee we serve and Thee we ask for aid.<br />
5 Guide us in the right path,<br />
6 the path of those Thou art gracious to;<br />
7 not of those Thou art wroth with; nor of those who err. </p>
<p>In general, they say to trust one’s own heart in religion. Don’t be a hypocrite and try to be sincere in your practice. They have created an Islam of knowledge of the basic rules and Mosque etiquette but no real learning of Islamic sources. They say to trust the heart for matters of interpretation. Imama, kadis, and scary sources of authority do not play a role in their thinking. How can I evaluate if the next generation will return to sources of authority and which ones they will choose?</p>
<p>They affirm the need for salat (worship) five times a day, yet they also say that God wants you to be engaged in medicine or business or community work so that if you miss some of the prayers it is OK. Once or twice a day is enough is one is busy with other service of God such as helping people. There is a form of osek be mitzvah patur min hamitzvah and rahmana leba bai.</p>
<p>When asked about restrictive fatwas, salafi interpretation or about Islamic reformers, they tend to shrug it off and say: Dont question others or engage in polemics- love all – don’t fight with the right or the left.</p>
<p>So how do I evaluate them? Where will they be in 20 years? 40 years? Are they like the Conservative movement of 1940’s – traditionalists following accepted practices of the people? Are they renewal and romantic for their setting as their base a universal reading of Sufism as tolerance, love, and intercultural understanding? Are they Modern Orthodox for their insistence on women covering their hair and everyone only eating OU kosher as their halal– both inside and outside the home? (There is money to be made by the OU giving them seminars in what to look for in ingredients and how to navigate American Kashrut.)<br />
What happens when the kids open the books? Will they?</p>
<p>To offer a comparison: Teaneck has a new Muslim Mayor affiliated with the local Mosque and Muslim day school. In the Teaneck al-Ghazzali school they have half a day religious studies and half a day general studies. The Gulen schools all have only secular studies and one period a week of religion. To teach classes in al-Ghazzali, they sometimes have less than modernist teachers and the textbooks are produced in Pakistan. In the Gulen school, every teacher is bright-eyed and supportive of Gulen’s vision of love, tolerance, and purity of the heart. Here in Teaneck, the Muslim women do not all cover their hair but in the Gulen movement they do.</p>
<p>So how do I evaluate the movement? How are they similar or difference than the American Jewish entrance into modernity? Where will they be in 20 years?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I am back from Turkey or as they keep telling me I am in the Anatolian peninsula and Turkey is the greater vision of the Ottoman-Turkish Empire. I had a Jewish-Christian conference here followed by a whirlwind tour provided by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BClen_movement">Gulen Movement started by </a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fethullah_G%C3%BClen">Fethelulah Gulen.</a></p>
<p>The Gulen organization steers its followers between a state mandated modernism without religion or an Islamic totalizing embrace of religion. In Turkey, a country where the public school and society does not teach Islam, the Gulen society advocates a completely secular curriculum under religious auspices and the keeping of the practices of one&#8217;s youth. In the US where it is permitted to teach religion in a private school, they only teach secular studies in their charter school in NJ and their private boarding school in CT. They only have a chaplain on campus and one period a week of religion (like the old Episcopal prep schools). With the Gulen Society’s help, they send first generation students to a good colleges and then medical school or other professions. It produces a modernized Islam that keeps the commandments but has little to do with the vast corpus of Islamic works since they do not study them.  The only Islamic teaching that they study are the writings of Fethelulah Gulen, who defines Islam as love, tolerance, interfaith and cultural dialogue, science, and caring for others. Numbers of adherents are hard to come by and vary from 500k to 10milion. The Gulen movement is one of the many emergent faces of 21st century Islam and you will be hearing much about them in the future.</p>
<p>The Gulen society is trying to create a modern-orthodox Islam in Turkey. They don’t trust the airlines when they say it is halal and women refrain from shaking men’s hands. (But men will shake women’s hands in a business context.) Women are encouraged to cover their hair. They wear Western dress and push for secular university study and want to blend into American democracy. Their NJ charter day school emphasizes the study of science and that you will get into a good college.</p>
<p>Turkey is officially a secular country maintained by the military. It has a prime minister who is head of the ruling religious party (but a PM even if religious cannot enforce religion or else he will be ousted by the military). The Gulan society is trying to create a middle ground between secular and Islamist and is supported by the police and the businessmen. There is a whole class of newly minted doctors and factory owners who support the movement. Fethullah Gulen himself is in exile in PA since he was seen as promoting religion in Islam, which is illegal.</p>
<p>I am not talking politics, but religion. So limit your comments to his modern religion. Nevertheless I must point out that he was on Israel’s side against the current PA flotilla disaster. I repeat please deal with the politics elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575284721280274694.html">Reclusive Turkish Imam Criticizes Gaza Flotilla</a><br />
SAYLORSBURG, Pa.—Imam Fethullah Gülen, a controversial and reclusive U.S. resident who is considered Turkey&#8217;s most influential religious leader, criticized a Turkish-led flotilla for trying to deliver aid without Israel&#8217;s consent. Mr. Gülen said organizers&#8217; failure to seek accord with Israel before attempting to deliver aid &#8220;is a sign of defying authority, and will not lead to fruitful matters.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fethullah_G%C3%BClen">Fethullah Gulen</a> is a liberal hanafi imam when it comes to law, (think of Rav Uziel or Rav Nissim) and he is against the strictures that has emanated from the influence of Salafi (Wahabi) Islam or from the Brotherhood in Egypt.  While denying to actually follow Sufism, Gulen is a neo-Sufi- following and modernizing their ideas (Think, neo-hasidism). Gülen was a student and follower of Sheikh Sa’id-i Kurdi (1878-1960), also known as Sa’id-i Nursi, the founder of the Islamist Nur (light) movement. In contrast, Salafi Muslims, for example the Saadis, consider all forms and ideas of Sufism to be Baadah- innovation, changing the tradition,  not binding, heresy.</p>
<p>Now for some of the interesting points. Once again, like Centrist Orthodoxy or Evangelicals, the community is linked to success and making money.</p>
<blockquote><p>The movement appears to be very rich, leading to questions about the source of its money (with the implication that if the money is &#8220;bad&#8221;, then the movement must be too). The answer seems to be: voluntary donations, largely from rich businessmen. The Gülen network&#8217;s organizations &#8211; mainly schools, based in over 100 countries &#8211; are publicly registered and subject to legal scrutiny. Their members are also highly motivated, as reflected in the fact that Fethullah Gülen was (in July 2008) voted the world&#8217;s most significant intellectual in the respected intellectually monthly journal Prospect.</p>
<p>At the event, we listened to the stories of men from humble backgrounds who had after years of work and investment recently become rich; they now supported the movement&#8217;s drive for an ethical capitalism. They seemed to personify the argument of the Nobel prize-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk (in his memoir Istanbul: Memories of a City) that the elite&#8217;s cosiness with the Turkish Kemalite military is based on the shared fear that people rooted in or close to the great unwashed mass of urban and rural (and Muslim) working people are on the verge of gaining power- <a href="http://www.fethullahgulen.org/about-fethullah-gulen/an-analysis-of-the-gulen-movement.html">more here </a></p></blockquote>
<p>On woman’s issues they are in favor of woman’s equality and entering the modern world but they are against woman’s prayer quorums or female imams.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Qur&#8217;anic verses which insist on women&#8217;s equal human status with men really do seem to operate in the movement. The women (choose to) obey the injunction to dress modestly; at the same time, the verse &#8220;(there) is no compulsion in religion&#8221; seems to operate as strongly on this question as it does in the movement&#8217;s relations with people of other faiths. But, as the Muslim feminist Kecia Ali points out, the Qur&#8217;an does not propose full social equality, however ‘complementary&#8217; men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s roles are seen to be (see Sexual Ethics And Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur&#8217;an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence, Oneworld, 2006).</p></blockquote>
<p>On questions of globalization, interfaith, and modern vales they are of the same cloth as Rabbi Jonathan Sacks because of their emphasis on the Neo-Sufism to create a vision of love, brotherhood of man, and natural human piety. The Gulen Society’s motto is “All is based on Love.” Rumi for a modern age.</p>
<p>The movement builds on Sufism; they define their Islam with pithy paragraphs like this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the basis of Sufism lies a struggle with the self, a purification of the heart, and a feeding of the soul. This is accomplished with prayers and remembrance, and with increasingly extra forms of worships. If the methodology of fıqh constitutes a fundamental part of Islamic civilization, social mind, worship, and transactions; Sufism should be viewed as the most important manifestation of Islamic spirituality. Sufism is not solely a lifestyle. It is at the same time a special perspective that determines how the Sufi should establish relations with his Lord, with himself, and with the whole universe and all its contents. But this perspective is a perfect worldview in wider and philosophical meaning. &#8211; <a href="http://www.fethullahgulen.org/about-fethullah-gulen/an-analysis-of-the-gulen-movement/3044-the-spiritual-life-in-islam.html">more here.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Gulen society is not into theological dialogue and they rarely discuss Islam or even mention that they are Muslims. They advocate friendship dinners where you have a evening where clergy of all faiths, along with politicians and government officials meet and deliver fellowship speeches. (They hold three a year in NJ). For example, you can find on the web a speech by Bill Clinton at one of these dinners. They also advocate joint visits to religious sites and religious ruins- let&#8217;s bring Jews, Muslims, and Christians to ruins in Ephesus or to see the synagogues of Istanbul.  They have contacts with Jewish organizations and are playing an increasing roll in local and US politics.</p>
<p>IF you have any thoughts on their brand of modern Islam, their religion, or their means of interfaith then please leave a comment. If you are coming to preach politics of Islamophobia please go elsewhere.</p>
<p>This post was written before spending 12 days with them, it was modified slightly after seeing them in the field. I will have a follow-up post(s) on their religiosity, and some of the cultural elements brought up by Thomas Friedman&#8217;s recent op-eds.</p>

				<p>Two items in the paper of importance to the Jewish-Muslim encounter.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=177302"><strong>Sufi sheikh who preached nonviolence laid to rest</strong></a><br />
By LAUREN GELFOND FELDINGER.</p>
<p>In a small and ancient family plot attached to his ancestral home in Jerusalem’s Old City, <strong>regional Sufi leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz Bukhari</strong> was laid to rest on Tuesday at age 61, after a long struggle with heart disease. He was head of the mystical Naqshabandi Holy Land Sufi Order.</p>
<p>A longtime proponent of nonviolence and interfaith unity, Bukhari found his inspiration in Islamic law and tradition, as well as in the writings of Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. “The stronger one is the one who can absorb the violence and anger from the other and change it to love and understanding. It is not easy; it is a lot of work. But this is the real jihad,” he once told the Globaloneness Project in an interview.</p>
<p>His teachings and practices put him in danger and under great stress that over the years harmed his health, said Sheikh Ghassan Manasra of Nazareth, whose father heads the regional Holy Land Qadari Sufi Order. “Sheikh Bukhari influenced lots of people, worked hard to bridge the religions and cultures; and his teaching is keeping part of the youth on the right path. We worked together for many years and succeeded many times and failed many times and decided to stay on the [path] of God to bring peace, tolerance, harmony and moderation,” he said.</p>
<p>“But on both sides, Jewish and Muslim, there are moderates but also extreme people, and our work was very dangerous, with a lot of pressure and stress until now, and I think this explains, in part, his heart problems.”</p>
<p>Bukhari later also got involved in the Interfaith Coordinating Council in Israel, the Interfaith Encounter Association, and the Sulha Peace Project, and in 2007 launched the “Jerusalem Hug” every June 21, where Israelis, Palestinians and foreigners of all faiths form a human chain of prayer around the Old City.</p>
<p><strong>During Operation Cast Lead, Bukhari initiated a delegation of Arab youth and religious leaders to show solidarity with the students and teachers in Sderot and to share the pain of his own family’s experience in Gaza.<br />
“He was really special,” Rabbi Tzion Cohen, a native of Sderot who is chief rabbi of the Shaar Hanegev region, said of their meeting.<br />
“Despite his own great pain for his family, and despite the fact that some of the group got heated up during the discussion, he and his wife remained gentle and patient and so very kind. I was truly impressed by their pleasantness.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/05/30/2739373/report-us-muslim-jewish-engagement-growing"><strong>Muslim-Jewish engagement is growing in the United States, with the greatest expansion during the past two years, a new report found </strong></a></p>
<p>Even as the political situation in the Middle East continues to heat up, more groups dedicated to Muslim-Jewish education, dialogue and joint social action are being formed, according to the report issued by the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement in Los Angeles, a partnership between Hebrew Union College, Omar Ibn Al Khattab Foundation and the University of Southern California. The data were collected from two surveys conducted in November 2009.</p>
<p>More than 70 percent of these groups have emerged since 9/11. Of those, half were created in the past 24 months. Half of the groups have no staff or budget, demonstrating a heavy reliance on volunteerism. Fifty percent of existing groups raise less than $250 a year, according to the report. </p>
<p>Many of the newest groups emerged from the Weekend of Twinning, a two-year-old project of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding that has brought together more than 200 mosques and synagogues for weekends of joint activity. Seventy percent of the mosques and synagogues that took part in the 2009 weekend say they have developed ongoing relationships.</p></blockquote>

				<p>Here is an interesting interfaith moment of a frum couple from Bergen county finding themselves on Turkish TV. I knew of this as soon as it occurred but was waiting for the You Tube.  The couple are interested in Jewish Muslim reconciliation and were in correspondence with Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) and visited him and found themselves recorded for posterity. Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) is the leading Turkish creationist rejecting secular Turkey and the more rational Islamic approaches. Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) has a rich debate around him on the web. Look at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Oktar">wiki page</a> and the <a href="http://commentsaboutadnanoktar.com/">Anti-Wiki pages.</a> and <a href="http://whoisharunyahya.wordpress.com/category/adnan-oktar/">hate sites against him.</a> Was he anti-Semitic and then saw the light after a prison term and is now pushing for Jewish-Muslim reconciliation? Was he imprisoned and placed in a psycho ward as a set-up victim of the state or did he deserve it? <a href="http://newhumanist.org.uk/2131/sex-flies-and-videotape-the-secret-lives-of-harun-yahya">Here is a critical article.</a></p>
<p>Update<br />
Gil Amminadav writes to me after reading the links on this post. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had read some of the allegations against Harun Yahya before (as well as his group&#8217;s responses), but nothing as emphatic as that Humanist article! It was a very well-written piece.  If we had read all of this before agreeing to meet with him, I can&#8217;t say that it would have changed anything; we believe that part of the purpose of cultivating a sensitivity towards negative and defamatory speech is to remind us that, when all is said and done, there is quite a lot said, and not nearly as much actually known.  Even with truth to a single allegation, we are not interested in judging, we are interested in working.  Another&#8217;s personal failures serve to remind us of our own &#8211; narcissism is hardly a unique trait.  All in all, the man struck us as sincerely interested in promoting friendship and fellowship, from within his own cultural context, and for that we give him much credit and hope that he inspires others to do the same, God willing.  If he has an imbalanced sexuality or mistreats others in any way, then we hope that God brings him &#8220;a healing of soul and a healing of body,&#8221; and that anyone who feels harmed by him is brought the same.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Elana and Gil Amminadav run Derusha Publishing, an indie  publishing house based in New Jersey. Among their publications is <a href="http://www.derushapublishing.com/the-naked-crowd.shtml">Hakham Jose Fauer&#8217;s recent book</a>. &#8220;So here are these young Jewish seekers who didn&#8217;t realize they were going to broadcast our  conversation until we actually sat down. I am not sure what to make of it. This stuff is going on all the time. Here is the TV interview in two parts. </p>

<blockquote><p>Look. See how Islam resembles Judaism? The fact they resemble one another stems from their being the same in the faith of the Prophet Abraham (pbuh) and very ancient Sunna, insha&#8217;Allah.</p>
<p>GIL AMMINADAV: Yes, even more. It is a river and everyone drinks from the river. And some people drink from here and some people drink from there. But it is the same river. Beyond Abraham (pbuh), Ishmael (pbuh), Isaac (pbuh) and Jacob (pbuh) and all these beyond today, you have people drinking from the same river and know. Unfortunately, it seems we have seen a lot of people, unfortunately a lot of Israeli, has forgotten. We are supposed to be the people of memory but we have forgotten. But we are now remembering</p>
<p>GIL AMMINADAV: We have a sheikh, a tzadik  (righteous teacher). His name was Rabbi Nachman ben Feiga, very nice person. He talks about the flip (sudden change) from this world order to the next world order. Inthe blink of an eye. No guns, no tanks, no missiles, just prayer</p>
<p>ELANA AMMINADAV: We also find that a lot of times we are looking forsomething called mussar, like instruction on how we can change ourselves. So when we find a Holy Book that teaches us or that points out things that might be problems in our people. Like things in the Qur&#8217;an talk about how the Jews might have worshipped their Rabbis. So then we can look at ourselves and say, why someone would say that to us, and that can teach us how to change and how to make ourselves better. </p></blockquote>
<p>Gil&#8217;s statement afterward:</p>
<div>&#8220;We believe it is worthwhile for human beings to see  the benefit in making religion a positive, unifying, and enriching  force in their lives and in their relationships.  Meetings between those  people who speak the language of friendship are key components of the  widespread change unfolding around us.  We were honored to reflect upon  the sanctity of Judaism, Islam, and other expressions of humanity&#8217;s  relationship with God, for those who find sanctity in them, with Mr.  Harun Yahya, a delightful, spiritually-sensitive educator and communal  leader in Istanbul.  We hope that as human beings recognize more of each  other in themselves, we will enter the next chapter of human history  with a liberating new vision of the future.&#8221;</div>
<p><strong><br />
For a sense of how common this is becoming. Harun Yahya has had many Israeli guests on his show</strong> including members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_attempt_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin">current attempted Sanhedrin.</a> A national Haredi yearning for the Ottoman Empire?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/images/1/1f/Hachrazah_5769_Kislev_15c.pdf">From the transcript:</a><br />
<a href="http://en.harunyahya.tv/videoDetail/Lang/4/Product/19282/ADNAN_OKTAR_AND_SANHEDRIN_RABBIS_ON_LIVE_TV_PROGRAM_%28DECEMBER_1,_2009%29">The video is here:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>RABBI ABRAHAMSON: Hello, my name is Benyamin Abrahamson. I am an orthodox Chassidic Jew from Israel. And I work as a historian or a kind of consultant to the court in Jerusalem that Rabbi Hollander is talking about. Mostly people here know me from my<br />
endless discussions about the similarities between the Islam and Jewish customs. I enjoy talking about the Hadiths, Tabari, Ibn Hisham and al-Waqidi, and talking about the kings of Himyar as I much as I enjoy talking about the Midrash Rabbah, the Midrashei Geulah,<br />
Rambam, Tosefos or the Shulchan Aruch. I like very much to talk about the common shared customs between Islam and Judaism, about the similarities in architecture between the masjid and the synagogue, between the similarities of the calendar, holidays and customs. But it is<br />
clear to me that there is more than just similarities, that they obviously go back to a common root and a common faith.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do we make of this reapproachment? It is not the commonality of Jews living in Arab lands or of neighbors. It is not exactly dialogue, theology, or formulated views. And it is happening on the margins. Help me make sense of the implications. I do not want to discuss the people involved, just the encounter.</p>

				<p>It has been an annual sighting in the newspapers for the last four years, several Muslim appreciations of Passover.  This holiday and the exodus from Egypt is discussed in the Koran. These human interest pieces allow modern Muslim to show their interfaith and tolerance credentials. The first is one of the best on the web, the second is the one that came to my attention as this year&#8217;s syndicated version, the third is a famous one from an Egyptian author 2007 that made the Israeli papers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readingislam.com/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1175751840758&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Discover_Islam%2FDIELayout">Out of Egypt  By Prof. Shahul Hameed</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Many Jews may be surprised to learn that Islam as preached by Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the same religion preached by Abraham, as well as of all other prophets mentioned in the Torah and the Bible. Muslims honor all the prophets of the Jews – Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon among others – as their own prophets.</p>
<p>Here is how Allah ordered Muhammad to follow the religion of the Patriarch Abraham:</p>
<p>[And lastly, We have inspired thee, O Muhammad, with this message: Follow the creed of Abraham, who turned away from all that is false, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God.] (An-Nahl 16:23)</p>
<p>In fact, the most important belief that unites Muslims and Jews is the faith in the One God as the Creator, Sustainer and Law-Giver of the universe. Both religions teach the need for establishing the Law of God on earth, so that there will be peace and harmony flourishing everywhere.</p>
<p>As Muslims have a Shari`ah (Law) to live by, the Jews have their Halakha (a compendium of laws, based on the Torah).</p>
<p>It is particularly noteworthy that in the Quran, there is no story that is recounted as many times and with as much emphasis, as the story of the bondage of the Children of Israel and their subsequent deliverance from Egypt&#8217;s Pharaoh. The Quran quotes Moses as saying to his people:</p>
<p>[O my people! Remember the blessings which God bestowed upon you when he raised up prophets among you, and made you your own masters, and granted unto you favors such as He had not granted to anyone else in the world.] (Al-Mai&#8217;idah 5:20)</p>
<p>It was Moses, with the help and guidance of God Almighty, who led them out of  Egypt towards a land of promise. Allah in the Quran says what means:  </p>
<p>[O children of Israel! Remember those blessings of Mine with which I graced you, and how I favored you above all other people. And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped. And remember the time when We saved you from Pharaoh&#8217;s people, who afflicted you with cruel suffering, slaughtering your sons and sparing only your women — which was an awesome trial from your Sustainer; and when We cleft the sea before you, and thus saved you and caused Pharaoh&#8217;s people to drown before your very eyes] (Al-Baqarah 2:47-50)</p>
<p>The story is narrated elsewhere in the Quran, where we may read these verses:</p>
<p>[We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when overwhelmed with the flood, he said: &#8220;I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in: I am of those who submit to Allah.&#8221; It was said to him: &#8220;Ah, now? But a little while before, wast thou in rebellion! and thou didst mischief and violence! This day shall We save thee in the body, that thou may be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!&#8221;</p>
<p>We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place, and provided for them sustenance of the best: it was after knowledge had been granted to them, that they fell into schisms. Verily Allah will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them, on the Day of Judgment.] (Yunus 10:90-93)</p>
<p>The torments inflicted on the Children of Israel by the Pharaoh were continuous and harsh; and so God sent His prophets Moses and Aaron (peace be upon them) to warn the tyrant that he should stop the oppression of the Children of Israel and free them.</p>
<p>But he was arrogant and refused to free the Jewish slaves, until the last of the plagues God sent as punishment. The first-born of both man and beast were destined to fall down dead on that fateful night. Pesach, or Passover, means protection in Hebrew, and the name refers to this last of the plagues sent by God to the Egyptians. While the Egyptians suffered this plague, the angel of death passed over the houses of the Israelites. To protect themselves, the Israelites had marked their homes with lamb&#8217;s blood so that the angel of death could easily &#8220;pass over&#8221; their homes.</p>
<p>Under guidance from God, the Israelites fled Egypt; while the Pharaoh and his men pursued them. It seemed like their journey would end at the Red Sea which prevented their escape.</p>
<p>But a miracle happened when Moses struck the water with his staff: The waves of the Red Sea parted and the Israelites hurried along the passage between the parted waves. Pharaoh and his soldiers followed; but by the time the Israelites reached the other shore, the sea closed in engulfing their pursuers. Thus the Israelites were delivered from bondage, and the Pharaoh and his people perished.  </p>
<p>Muslims are in sympathy with the Jewish celebration of the Pesach, as the fast on `Ashura&#8217; amply demonstrates. When the Prophet Muhammad came to Madinah on the tenth of the lunar month of Muharram, he found that the Jews there were fasting.</p>
<p>The Prophet asked them why they were fasting on this day, and they explained that it was the day that God saved the Children of Israel from the Pharaoh, and that Moses fasted in thanks on this day. The Prophet said, &#8220;We have more claim to Moses than you.&#8221; He fasted on that day and commanded Muslims to fast on the day. (Al-Bukhari)</p>

He is the author of three books on Islam published in the Malayalam language. His books are on comparative religion, the status of women, and science and human values.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.startribune.com/yourvoices/88903517.html">Passover Seder Through Muslim Eyes By Zafar Siddiqui</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This past Sunday, I attended an interfaith Seder at the Temple of Aaron synagogue in St. Paul. It was a beautiful event. By the end of the Seder meal, I could not but come to a conclusion that the story of Moses (peace be upon him) and his followers’ struggle against the tyranny of the Pharaoh will continue to inspire countless people, communities, and countries in seeking the freedom and dignity that God bestowed on the children of Adam.</p>
<p>It may come as a surprise to a lot of people that Muslims observe the fast of &#8216;Ashura to commemorate the day when God delivered Moses (peace be upon him) and his followers from slavery. The day of &#8216;Ashura falls on the 10th day of the Muslim month of Muharram.</p>
<p>Moses is called Musa in Arabic. He is also called &#8220;Kalim Allah&#8221; (One who spoke with God). He is the most mentioned prophet in the Qur&#8217;an.  The Muslim narrative about the exodus story is detailed and has a strong parallel to the Biblical narrative. Some excerpts from the Qur’an are given below.</p>
<p>Moses&#8217; Childhood<br />
&#8220;And We had already conferred favor upon you another time, when We inspired to your mother what We inspired, [Saying], ‘Cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an enemy to Me and an enemy to him.’ And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye.</p>
<p>[And We favored you] when your sister went and said, ‘Shall I direct you to someone who will be responsible for him?’ So We restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve. And you killed someone, but We saved you from retaliation and tried you with a [severe] trial. And you remained [some] years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses.&#8221; (20: 38-41)</p>
<p>The Burning Bush<br />
&#8220;And has the story of Moses reached you? – When he saw a fire and said to his family, “Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire; perhaps I can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance. And when he came to it, he was called, “O Moses, indeed, I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Tuwā. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed [to you]. Indeed, I am God. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.” (20: 9-14)</p>
<p>Moses and his brother Aaron confront Pharaoh<br />
&#8220;So go to him and say, ‘Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace will be upon he who follows the guidance.&#8221; (20:47)</p>
<p>Moses and his duel with Pharaoh’s magicians<br />
&#8220;They said, “O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw.” He said, “Rather, you throw.” And suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving [like snakes]. And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses. God said, “Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior. And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. What they have crafted is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is.&#8221; So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, “We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.&#8221; (20: 65-70)</p>
<p>Freedom at last<br />
&#8220;And We had inspired to Moses, “Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning].” So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them.&#8221; (20: 77-78)</p>
<p>As I was going through the Haggadah at the Seder, these parallel narrations came to my mind. In a world where injustices, occupations, and wars abound, the story of Moses gives us hope that God will never let any injustice thrive for long. The challenges may seem like the veritable sea in front of us, but, as a follower of Moses, I believe that nothing is impossible for God. Peace is inevitable.</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is a link to one from 2007 that made the Israeli papers because it acknowledged the plight of Arab Jews and the Jewish lineage of many current Arabs.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.zionism-israel.com/2007/04/hisham-al-tuhi-many-arabs-have-jewish.html">In an article on the Arab reformist websites Aafaq (April 9, 2007) and Middle East Transparent (April 8, 2007</a>), Egyptian author Hisham Al-Tuhi rejects the view that Muslims should not convey holiday greetings to non-Muslims on their holidays, reviews the history of Jews in Arab countries in the 20th century, and wishes Jews still living in Arab countries a happy Passover. </p>
<p>The Jews Who Remain &#8220;Still Celebrate Their Holidays in Silence, Forgotten&#8230; Is Not the Least We Can Say to Them: Jewish Arabs Happy Passover!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite this  despite the nationalization, the expulsion, the banishment, the bombings, the racism, the enmity, and the marginalization; despite their being reviled with the ugliest abuse in the prayers of the Muslims, in all of the Arab mosques and in some of the churches; despite their being called infidels and cursed, and being accused of treason, in the books, the newspapers, and the TV stations, [both] governmental and private  despite all this, they still live in Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, and in other countries of the Arab Middle East!</p>
<p>&#8220;And they still celebrate their holidays in silence, forgotten. And they still passionately love their countries who treated them cruelly, and will no accept any substitute [for them].</p>
<p>&#8220;Is not the least we can say to them: Jewish Arabs happy Passover!?&#8221; </p></blockquote>

				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Muqtedar_Khan">M. A. Muqtedar Khan,</a> professor of political science at the University of Delaware offer his fellow Muslims a suggestion of a topic to speak about.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/3484">“He was the best of the Jews”</a></p>
<p><strong>If Muslim Imams told the story of Rabbi Mukhayriq to their congregations in America and elsewhere, I am confident that it will contribute to manifestations of increased tolerance by Muslims towards others. </strong></p>
<p>By Muqtedar Khan, December 28, 2009</p>
<p>There are many stories that contemporary Imams rarely tell their congregations. The story of Mukhayriq, a Rabbi from Medina is one such story. I have heard the stories about the battle of Uhud, one of prophet Muhammad’s major battles with his Meccan enemies, from Imams and Muslim preachers hundreds of times, but not once have I heard the story of Rabbi Mukhayriq who died fighting in that battle against the enemies of Islam.</p>
<p>So, I will tell the story of Rabbi Mukhayriq – the first Jewish martyr of Islam. It is quite apropos as the season of spiritual holidays is here.</p>
<p>Mukhayriq was a wealthy and learned leader of the tribe of Tha’labah. He fought with Prophet Muhammed in the battle of Uhud on March 19, 625 AD and was martyred in it. That day was a Saturday. Rabbi Mukhayriq addressed his people and asked them to go with him to help Muhammed. His tribe’s men declined saying that it was the day of Sabbath. Mukhayriq chastised them for not understanding the deeper meaning of Sabbath and announced to his people that if he died in the battle his entire wealth should go to Muhammed.</p>
<p>Mukhayriq died in battle against the Meccans. And when Muhammed, who was seriously injured in that battle, was informed about the death of Mukhayriq, Muhammed said, “He was the best of Jews.”</p>
<p>Muhammed inherited seven gardens and other forms of wealth from Mukhayriq. Muhammed used this wealth to establish the first waqf – a charitable endowment &#8211; of Islam. It was from this endowment that the Prophet of Islam helped many poor people in Medina.</p>
<p>When Muhammed migrated form Mecca to Medina in 622 he signed a treaty with the various tribes that lived in and around Medina. Many of these tribes had embraced Islam, some were pagan and others were Jewish. All of them signed the treaty with Muhammed that is referred to by historians as the Constitution of Medina. The first Islamic state, a multi-tribal and multi-religious state, established by Muhammed in Medina was based on this social contract.</p>
<p>According to Article 2 of the Constitution, all tribes who were signatory to the treaty constituted one nation (ummah). Mukhayriq’s people too were signatories to this treaty and were obliged to fight with Muhammed in accordance to Article 37 of the Constitution, which says:<br />
The Jews must bear their expenses and the Muslims their expenses. Each must help the other against anyone who attacks the people of this document. They must seek mutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a protection against treachery. A man is not liable for his ally’s misdeeds. The wronged must be helped.<br />
<strong>In a way Rabbi Mukhayriq, who was also a well-respected scholar of Jews in Medina, was merely being a good citizen and was fulfilling a social contract. But his story is fantastic, especially for our times when we are struggling to build bridges between various religious communities. Mukhayriq’s loyalty, his bravery, his sacrifice and his generosity are inspirational.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps it is about people like Mukhayriq that the Quran says:<br />
<strong>And there are, certainly, among Jews and Christians, those who believe in God, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, bowing in humility to God. They will not sell the Signs of God for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord (3:199).<br />
Mukhayriq’s story is a story of an individual’s ability to transcend communal divides and to fight for a more inclusive idea of community. He was a true citizen of the state of Medina and he gave his life in its defense. He was a Jew and he was an Islamic hero and his story must never be forgotten and must be told and retold. When Muslims forget to remember his, and other stories that epitomize interfaith relations they diminish the legacy of Islam and betray the cause of peace.</strong></p>
<p>If Muslim Imams told his story in their congregations in America and elsewhere, I am confident that it will contribute to manifestations of increased tolerance by Muslims towards others. There are many such wonderful examples of brotherhood, tolerance, sacrifice and good citizenship in Islamic traditions that undergird the backbone of Islamic ethics. I wish we told them more often.</p>
<p>Muqtedar Khan is Director of Islamic Studies at the University of Delaware and a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>In another one of his writings <a href="http://www.islamfortoday.com/khan06.htm">The Islamic State and Religious Minorities,</a> he offer these comments on the role of Jews within Islam. He is looking to cultivate Muslim theories of religious tolerance against those who have been advocating an Islamic state. He wants an Islam based on social contract not coercion. </strong><strong> He presents early Islam as a</strong><strong> Jewish-Muslim federation.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The irony of this reality is that in seeking to impose Islamic law and create an Islamic state, Islamists are actually in direct opposition to the spirit and letter of the Quran.</strong> The Quran is very explicit when it says “there is no compulsion in religion,” (Quran 2: 256).  Elsewhere the Quran exhorts Jews to live by the laws revealed to them in the Torah. In fact The Quran expresses surprise that some Jews sought the arbitration of the Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him) rather than their own legal tradition (5:43). The Quran also orders Christians to live by their faith; “So let the people of the Gospel judge by that which Allah has revealed therein, for he who judges not by that which Allah has revealed is a sinner,” (Quran 5:47). <strong>From these verses it is abundantly clear that an Islamic state must advocate religious pluralism even to the extent of permitting multiple legal systems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unlike the present day Islamists, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), when he established the first Islamic state in Medina – actually a Jewish-Muslim federation extended to religious minorities the rights that are guaranteed to them in the Quran.  Prophet Muhammad’s Medina was based on the covenant of Medina, a real and actual social contract agreed upon by Muslims, Jews and others that treated them as equal citizens of Medina. </strong>They enjoyed the freedom to choose the legal system they wished to live under. Jews could live under Islamic law, or Jewish law or pre-Islamic Arab tribal traditions. There was no compulsion in religion even though Medina was an Islamic state. The difference between Medina and today’s Islamic states is profound. The state of Medina was based on a real social contract that applied divine law but only in consultation and with consent of all citizens regardless of their faith. But contemporary Islamic states apply Islamic law without consent or consultation and often through coercion.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Siman Tov Melammed: (before 1793- 1823 or 1828, nom de plume Tuvyah)  was an Iranian Jewish rabbi, poet and polemicist. He was the hakham, the spiritual leader of the community of Mashad and had to deal with a variety of religious tension of the era including forced disputations with Shii Imams. In 1839, the entire community was forced to convert to Islam. They lived as relatively secret Jews until the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Raphael Patai wrote a book on them Jadid al-Islam.</p>
<p>We usually associate Jewish-Sufism with Bahye ibn Pakuda, Avraham ben haRambam, and other Egyptian descendents of Maimonides such as David Maimuni or Joshua Maimuni. (These have been published by Paul Fenton with French translation and have not attained a wide readership.) Melammed’s writings are the tip of a much larger world of Jewish Sufi thought in Persia and Central Asia. Melammed wrote, in Persian, a philosophic and mystical poetic commentary on Maimonides thirteen principles called <em>Hayat al Ruh</em>; a sufi commentary on the <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>. Within the large treatise, he wrote a poem in praise of Sufis.  Vera Moreen translated selections in 2000, (<em>Queen Esther’s Garden</em>, Yale UP , 2000) Below are 6 stanzas out of 30 (not to run a foul of fair usage laws.).</p>
<p>Melammed praises the Sufis for transcending their physical bodies and the habits of ordinary life to become servants of God. They are radiant and contented from their devotion to God and they lead other back through a straight path to God.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Description of the Pious Sufis Roused from the Sleep of Neglect</strong></p>
<p>Godly and radiant like roses</p>
<p>The Sufis are, the Sufis,</p>
<p>Whose carnal soul is dead,</p>
<p>Doused their desires, the Sufis.</p>
<p>Firmly they grasp the straight path,</p>
<p>Leaders benevolent, guides</p>
<p>Of those who strayed are the Sufis.</p>
<p>Drunk with the cup and soul’s sweets,</p>
<p>With love of seeing the Unseen;</p>
<p>Without reins in both hands are the Sufis.</p>
<p>Dead to the world of the moment,</p>
<p>Alive to the hear after;</p>
<p>Full of merit and kindness are the Sufis.</p>
<p>God’s love is their beloved,</p>
<p>God’s affection their decoration,</p>
<p>And that which veils Him from the Sufis.</p>
<p>The most contented of beggars,</p>
<p>Avoiding rancor and dispute;</p>
<p>Freed from the Day of Punishment are the Sufis.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue must have been seriously debated because there is also a poem by an unknown Jacob against Jews becoming Sufis. The poem says to follow Moses, and his father Imran and to avoid the path of the famous Sufi Majnun. One should not relinquish one’s status as the chosen people for a universal faith.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jacob: Against Sufis</strong></p>
<p>O people of “Imran’s son”</p>
<p>Let not Satan deceive you,</p>
<p>Lest you forfeit religion and faiths;</p>
<p>My life for Moses’ life;</p>
<p>Whoever abandons his faith</p>
<p>Becomes a sage like Majnun,</p>
<p>Roaming about, confused;</p>
<p>My life for Moses’ life.</p>
<p>Bravely he is called a friend.”</p>
<p>But he turns common instead of chosen,</p>
<p>[Now] what religion can he call his own?</p>
<p>My life for Moses’ life.</p></blockquote>
