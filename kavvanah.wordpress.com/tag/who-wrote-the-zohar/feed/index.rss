										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I am behind on posting about some of the new works on Kabbalah. In the meantime here is a nice video interview with Ronit Meroz about her forthcoming book about the various strata in the Zohar. She states that the texts of the Zohar were written between the 11th and the 14th century, layer upon layer, each generation adding or taking out what they wanted. she claims that the manuscripts show that there were many things called Zohar.<br />
Meroz places the first texts in Israel in the 11th century, those texts were reworkings of Rabbinic ideas taken a little further. The early drafts were not mystical yet, rather more mythic versions of Rabbinic statements. Here is an 18 page taste of her book <a href="http://sephardic.fiu.edu/journal/RonitMeroz.pdf">from an earlier article.</a> (Whatever similarities her view has to Emden and Sde Hemed would need to wait until the full book comes out.)<br />
 For the alternate view, <a href="http:///kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/was-the-zohar-ever-a-book/">see my post on Daniel Abrams,</a> who claims the Zohar was never a book until created by the printers.</p>
<p>Notice how she changes the question when the interviewer asks: Is it worth it [to spend a decade looking at 1000 manuscripts]? Is it interesting to do this?</p>
