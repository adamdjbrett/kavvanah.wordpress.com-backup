										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>R. Yosef Karo writes that he followed the kavvanot of the Ramak.</strong></p>
<p>In contrast, to Provençal method where there is an ascent to <em>tiferet</em> or <em>binah</em>. In Cordovero&#8217;s method, as mentioned above, the <em>shekhinah</em> itself is raised and the entire system collapses up like <strong><em>the folding up of a telescope</em>.</strong> One folds <em>shekhinah</em> up beyond <em>nezah</em> and <em>hod </em>which makes her the same as <em>tiferet</em>, not that there is only <em>tiferet </em>or that she merged into <em>tiferet</em>, but that she has been raised to the point of <em>tiferet</em>.  From <em>tiferet</em>, the shekhinah together with <em>tiferet</em> receive from an influx from <em>binah</em>. There is  loss of differentiation and integration within <em>binah</em>. This ascent during the silent prayer allows the entrance and then the merging of the soul into the supernal realms.</p>
<p>The passage contains the division of <strong>ADNY</strong> into <strong>AY</strong>, the Infinite oneness found within ten sefirot showing unity of keter, tiferet, and malkhut, and <strong>DN</strong> the forces of judgment and materiality showing the emanation process as privation from the Divine goodness.</p>
<p>Here we have words of the amidah especially the name <strong>A-donai (A-d-n-y)</strong> divided into <em>Aleph</em> for the top three sefirot, and <em>daled-nun</em> as judgment of the world, and <em>yod</em> as the ten sefirot. The infinite light (<em>aleph</em>) above descends to the earthy world of judgment (<em>daled-nun</em>) through the means of the ten sefirot (<em>yod</em>). The infinite light cascades down in emanation as the discrete units of the three Divine names, E-hyah, Y-H-V-H, and A-donai.</p>
<p><strong><em>ADNY, </em></strong>this name is <em>malkhut</em>.</p>
<p>Meditate that She is now higher than <em>nezah</em> and <em>hod</em>, as She is silently rising between the two shepherds during the unification of the recitation of the <em>Shema</em>. The mystery of prayer is their literal union, that they completely unite. The individual is silent because the union is in silence. Voice (<em>kol</em>), <em>tiferet</em>, is not heard outside at all,. The mystery of this verse is to open the door of the palace for the worshiper to enter inside. Thus, he knocks on the opening of the palace gate, holy of holies, in order to enter inside, to unify and bind. As it is known, inside the palace is <em>malkhut</em>, bound with the three fathers whose mystery is love (<em>ahavah</em>).</p>
<p>One knocks and says, “<strong>my Lord” (<em>ADNY</em>)</strong>, who is <em>malkhut</em>, as she is the aspect bound in the mystery of <em>daled nun</em> that she is the mystery of <em>alef</em>, which is the name <em>eh-yeh</em> in <em>binah</em> and the mystery of <em>yud</em>, which is <em>Y-H-V-H</em> in <em>tiferet</em>. This is why she is called <em>Ado-nai</em>, tied to three names, <em>Eh-yeh</em>, <em>Y-H-V-H</em>, <em>Ado-nai</em> on <em>nezah</em> and <em>hod</em>.</p>
<p><strong>“My lips”</strong> are <em>nezah</em> and <em>hod</em>;</p>
<p><strong>“open” (<em>tiftah</em>)</strong> from inside the palace. These are the openings of palace of the gates of righteousness so that I may enter them and praise Y-H (Psalms 118:19).</p>
<p><strong>“and my mouth” (<em>u’fi</em>) </strong>for through the opening of the lips the mouth is formed, which is <em>malkhut</em>. Since She does not have a mouth without open lips, immediately you will see <em>malkhut</em>.</p>
<p>Immediately, <strong>“will express” (<em>yaggid</em>), </strong>from the side of <em>hokhmah</em>, which is the mystery of <em>gimmel</em> <em>daled</em>, seven <em>sefirot</em> <em>GYD</em>, a drop from the brains that are drawn down in the mystery of semen that shoots like an arrow.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">First Blessing</span></p>
<p>The goal of the first blessing of the silent amidah is to draw down from <em>binah</em> into the lower sefirot of <em>yesod and malkhut</em>.</p>
<p>The following paragraph is a note written above the liturgy, so that the reader does not misunderstand the process and think that one is still just connecting the lower to the higher sefirot, The entire first <em>berakhah </em>is not only in <em>binah</em>, but in the depths of <em>binah</em>; while the other mentioned sefirot are all within <em>binah</em>. The imagery is of the infinite king, a cosmic deity, who is so great, that there are many aspects (<em>bekhinot</em>) , called inner limbs. This passage is not included in the first Rosh Hashanah commentary  and may be by another hand, but it does express the characteristics of the practice of the Cordovero intentions.</p>
<p>This entire blessing is in the depths of <em>binah</em> until <strong>“shield of Abraham</strong>” that She descends into <em>hesed</em>. Whenever it says that [the pray-er] goes down into <em>malkhut</em> and the <em>avot</em>, it is all hidden in <em>binah</em>. For the first blessing is the first principle of the king, and all the higher inner limbs are included in it. Thus, she will have many aspects.</p>
<p>Cordovero wrote notes above the words <strong>Bless</strong> and <strong>You</strong> explaining how the blessings within the amidah work.  He reiterates that his method is to go from top to bottom during blessings drawing down from the eyn sof to malkhut.</p>
<p><strong> “Bless”</strong> During the <em>amidah</em>, one should direct “<strong>bless</strong>” down from the <em>Ein Sof</em> to <em>yesod</em> including all ten <em>sefirot</em> from the Source of everything. The power to bring down influence from on high until <em>malkhut</em> below depends on thought.</p>
<p>This is why the <em>Zohar</em> says that one should not start at the level of “Your face,” so that you do not admonished, God forbid. Should he start “<strong>bless</strong>” from bottom-up, standing in <em>din</em>, then the going bottom-up is <em>din</em>. Rather, start from the top and go before His face below; this is the mystery of “blessed” from top-down to repair it beforehand with influx and sweetening its judgments.</p>
<p>Energy is drawn down from the top three sefirot to the middle six, first as <em>keter</em>, <em>hokhmah</em>, and <em>binah</em> into <em>tiferet,</em> then in the middle blessings one draws <em>daat</em> the animating vitality of the world into the twelve-sided version of <em>tiferet,</em> and in the concluding blessings of the amidah one brings the spiritual energy into <em>malkhut</em>.</p>
<p><em>Yesod</em> includes <em>yesod malkhut</em> (<em>YM</em>) from <em>keter</em> until <em>yesod</em> seals this world of <em>yesod</em> <em>malkhut</em> from the world of the male, spreading top-down.</p>
<p><strong>Blessed (<em>Barukh</em>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Malkhut</em> is the world of the female. <em>Alef</em> (<em>A</em>) is <em>keter</em>; <em>tav</em> (<em>T</em>) is <em>hesed</em>, <em>binah</em>, <em>gedulah</em>, <em>gevurah</em>; <em>hei</em> (<em>H</em>) is <em>tiferet</em> until <em>malkhut</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Are You (<em>Atah</em>; <em>ATH</em>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Tiferet</em>, which binds together male and female from the bottom up.</p>
