					<description><![CDATA[While I would agree that R. Abulafia was hardly guilty of &#039;ecumania&#039; he was of the opinion that the Torah was for the sages of all nations and even taught his doctrine to non-Jews.
His interest was in &#039;perception&#039; which is not limited to the religious structure. 
R. Yurovitsch, being a Toldot Aharon chasid, would not have been capable of seeing this aspect of R. Abulafia. I know this because I knew Yurovitsch and his &#039;hashgafa&#039; and after having some conversations with him I realized, at least for me, it was a waste of time.
i.e. Amnon Gross it would have been impossible for him to have learned with Y. for 15 years because Gross only came upon the writings of R. Abulafia in the late &#039;90&#039;s.
He first published  ספר חיי עולם הבא with an Ashkenazi commentary which only would confuse a newcomer to R. A&#039;s writings and took advice from me and republished it without the commentary.
As far as any scholarly or academic standard Gross&#039;s publications are what they call in the Israeli academic circles &#039;Mea Shearim&#039; editions, that is to say he never noted which mss. he used and in the case where there were more than one mss. he never compared recensions which in essence make his edition more of a veil than a revelation.
A good example of his &#039;astute&#039;{sic} publishing is in the two books חיי הנפש ו סתרי תורה both being a commentary  to the Guide. In as much as he is a Breslover chasid the Guide is an anathema for them and he was advised not to print them. If one looks at the  שער דף of either of these two books it does not mention that they are commentaries to the Guide but omits this entirely.
Caveats!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not know biographical details about Rav Avrohom Yurovitsch, but I believe that the Yurovitsch family all came to Jerusalem after World War 2 from Hungary or Transylvania. It is quite possible that he received a broader education in his youth, and thus felt comfortable reading secular works for the needs of his alternative medicine practice. He could have read them either in German or Hungarian, or read them in secular Hebrew works. Incidentally Kol Haloshon has many of his talks on the parsha available online, so one can easily taste his unique teachings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that there are parallels to kundalini yoga in Rav Yurevitch&#039;s Darkei HaHasagah. Amazingly, the author, who was a prominent figure in the Toldos Aharon enclave, was an extremely open-minded baal mevakesh who knew a thing or two about Indian mysticism and could find parallel teachings in the kabbalah. 

I heard that a booklet of teachings from his son, the current rosh ha-chaburah of &quot;Vitebsk,&quot; was distributed at a chasunah in Yerushalayim last week. Maybe you can obtain a copy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Brill,
You write:
&quot;In fifty years, Yurovitch’s instructions will be seen as the true Jewish tradition of breathing and meditating. A new ancient tradition, a reliable mesorah of the past is being constructed.&quot;

&quot;A new ancient tradition&quot; -- I was curious if you are referring to a rewrite of the past that will be accepted down the road as &quot;authentic,&quot; or instead a revelation, or resurfacing, of an older method of meditation that didn&#039;t involve the letters (letters = Abulafia) and was more direct (and hence more similar to Eastern methods)? 

If the latter, could you provide sources for earlier pre-Abulafian meditation methods that simply involved breathing and bypassed the letters altogether?

Put differently: Is this something new in Judaism or is it old and just being taken off the shelf,dusted off, and presented to today&#039;s generation that is more open to these types of techniques?
If the second is true, please list earlier Jewish sources. 

Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rav Avraham zazta&#039;l also has a two volume work on parsha that is in my opinion on the level of the early Hasidic masters.  
Also in Harav Yehuda Sheinfeld shlit&#039;a Osri LaGefen volume 12 on Aleph Nissan (The hilula of R. Avraham and b-day of Rebbe Nahman zy&#039;a), there is a wonderful essay by him that is about four ways to help individuals deal with fears based on both their birthday and gematria of their names as well as their mothers&#039;.  (Even if you are not into Rav Sheinfeld yet I highly recommend).
Also, Rav Avraham was a mashpia in Toldos Aharon]]></description>
