					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Brill,
Thank you for all of the elucidating posts. I have grown a lot through your shared knowledge. 

Three ideas for future posts that would interest me at least (I believe others, too):
If you have already done these, my apologies for missing them. I only started following your blog this year. 

1) Please do a proper interview with R&#039; Ysoscher Katz. From your posts on FB there is a constant dancing back and forth between you two and it would be lovely to hear his views, organized, by means of the type of thorough Q&#038;A you apply with other interviewees. 

2) A review of R&#039; Zalman Schachter Shalomi&#039;s thought and its contribution to modern Judaism. If you have something new to add to the mix, of course...

3) A response to the new Atheism (Harris, Dawkins, etc.). Would be riveting to hear an educated and scholarly rabbi work through their arguments, one by one, showing where they are on point or where they have constructed straw men (I believe they do this often, e.g., deconstructing a religion that nobody is really following today...). 
Maybe you hit the last two in previous posts. My apologies again for overlooking, if that is the case. 
Still, the first idea seems only natural in lieu of your expressed intrigue in his stances on various FB threads. 

Thank you so much,
Eli]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have always  been troubled  that Rav Shagar just  seemed to rather uncritically  assume that &quot;truth&quot; of post-modernism, and simply ignored its many critics.  What of science?  Do post-modernists  really wish to assert, to take just one example,  that the structure of  DNA,  discovered by  Watson and Crick  was  just  a &quot;culturally  bound truth&quot;??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Upon introspection we believe we recognize have a personal  history, a story we tell ourselves and others about our life, even when we have forgotten many of the details. Nothing hangs on the truth of such stories. What is important is that we have some idea how we started out and how we got to where we are today, who were and are the important people in our lives, our feelings towards them &#038; that this kind of story hang together more or less. Now some people have fragmented and gone psychotic, others are demented, but for most of us we have some measure who we are, what were our important life decisions, and our current values, goals and ideals. We use all of this in deciding how to live going forward, in expressing opinions etc.. R. Shagar makes it sound like we are all wandering around in a daze, like  characters  in some 1960s  Antonioni or Fellini movie. 

So what difference does it really make if the Hegelian grand narrative or Marxism or for that matter Labor Zionism has fallen into disrepute? The fewer the ‘isms’ the less competition for religion however understood. And if ‘truth’ is no longer what it used to be, how many Jews are upset that quantum mechanics seems so weird, cosmology is unsettled with little hope of settling the issues empirically. Even if the “I” is in some sense a construct, so is most of folk psychology. In an age of AI and robots about to satisfy Turing tests, who knows which psychological terms will survive? Will intention, agency or will be alive and kicking  a hundred years from now. Yet this presents no crisis for the continued use of folk psychology today?

I would say Rabbi Shagar is being over dramatic and a bit hysterical. There is no crisis.]]></description>
