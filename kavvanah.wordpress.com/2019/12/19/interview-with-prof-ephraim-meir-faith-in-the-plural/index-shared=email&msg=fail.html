<p>With classes finished for the semester, I need to catch up on my reading. On my table are several recent books, all of them of the last four years, explaining the recent turn to interreligious studies. The current trend is to replace the word interfaith with interreligious since the term faith is a Protestant understanding of religion. And to place greater emphasis on the prefix “inter” to show that we are interconnected, with interreligious moments all around us. Diversity is continuous factor in our lives playing a role even in law, politics media, athletics, and education. Another part of this trend is to replace the survey of world religions class with a class on interreligious moments in our lives. Students learn more about Judaism by discussing why Satmar representatives went to an open casket memorial in a funeral home but won’t go to a church funeral than studying random snippets of Genesis and Leviticus compared to the Vedas and Koran. </p>



<p>A recent Jewish book to deal with this new interreligious moment is Prof Ephraim Meir’s <a href="http://idra.org.il/product/faith-in-the-plural/"><em>Faith in the Plural</em> (Idra Press, 2019),</a> which is brand new and surprisingly not on Amazon or even available as of now in the US<em>.</em> The book has a great cover by Utah artist <a href="https://www.artneedlepoint.com/artists/tornquist-suzanne">Suzanne Tornquist.</a> (The cover art is also available as a talit or tefillin bag).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ephraimmeir.com/">Prof. Ephraim Meir</a> is Professor emeritus of modern Jewish Philosophy at Bar-Ilan University. His PhD is from KU Leuven in theology and he taught for decades at Bar Ilan University. A prolific author his recent works are Levinas’s Jewish Thought between Jerusalem and Athens (2008), Identity Dialogically Constructed (2011), Differenz und Dialog (2011), Between Heschel and Buber (2012; with A. Even-Chen), Dialogical Thought and Identity (2013), Interreligious Theology. Its Value and Mooring in modern Jewish Philosophy (2015) Becoming Interreligious (2017) and Old-New Jewish Humanism (2018). From 2009 until 2017, he was the Levinas guest Professor for Jewish Dialogue Studies and Interreligious Theology at the Academy of World Religions, University of Hamburg. He is President of the International Rosenzweig Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prof Meir’s latest book <a href="http://idra.org.il/product/faith-in-the-plural/">Faith in the Plural (Idra Press, 2019)</a> along with his prior works <em>Interreligous Theology </em>(2015) and <em>Becoming Interreligious </em>(2017) are his views on this change. Meir affirms the social fact of religious pluralism and also a theological view of pluralism based on John Hick. To give my reaction upfront, I accept the former and not the later. In addition, I don’t think Meir himself needs to affirm the later based on his own theory of trans-difference and testimony.</p>



<p>In the 1960’s, interfaith events, the Jewish-Christian reconciliation, and Church’s renewed encounter with Asian religions changed the theological climate. Alan Race created theological categories Exclusivist, Inclusivist, and Pluralist for the spectrum of positions taken at the time. </p>



<p>By 1970, John Hick the world renown philosopher argued that we must undertake a Copernican Revolution and assume one ultimate Reality and all religions are just attempts to grasp the Ultimate. Hick was widely influential and respected. Yet, in recent decades he received much criticism for thinking his was the only correct opinion, for his lack of empiricism, and for actually precluding interfaith understanding since religions are only metaphors and symbols for the ultimate Reality. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, much of the field has turned to various acceptance models that differ with Hick. Mark Heim argues that religions do not offer the same goals. For example, Christian redemption has little to do with the Yogic conception of perfection. George Lindback argued that each religion is a closed system, with different non-comparable rules. And the most common method now is comparative theology, where I compare my faith to another and seek understanding but without making any major claims about the relationship between my faith and the world’s faiths. (I find myself within these 21st century approaches.)</p>



<p>Ephraim Meir’s book assumes John Hick’s position as his starting point to argue for a philosophy of dialogue. Not dialogue in the 1960’s sense of comparing theology, but a 21<sup>st</sup> century definition. We dialogue as an act of encounter and knowing the complexity of the world, we dialogue in a Levinas sense of the other religion breaking into our world and making demands, and we dialogue to produce social justice and reduce violence. For Meir, dialogue moves the pluralistic position forward. </p>



<p>Meir gives five characteristics or requirements for dialogical theology, and this is one of the strong parts of the book. His five are humility, translation, uniqueness, hospitality and learning. Here Meir is seemingly building on the interreligious approach and comparative theology of the last decade including those of Francis X. Clooney, Marianne Moyaert, Catherine Corneille and many others. Yet, they are not cited or referenced</p>



<p>Meir, however, specifically is steering clear of developing a theology. And he does not think he needs to address comparative theology. He maintains a clear focus on dialogue both inter-religious and intra-religious.</p>



<p>Meir’s major point is that we understand and relate to other religions through what he calls trans-difference. His dialogical approach is not a meeting or in-between like Buber’s rather we belong simultaneously to the broader world and to our own framework. We are part of the specific and the general. </p>



<p>Another one of his concepts is testimony. I reveal the divine by my own self contraction and listening to the other. This concept is an outgrowth of his reading of Rosenzweig, Heschel, and Levinas. &nbsp;His reading of the modern classics to produce his concept of trans-difference is how he deals with contemporary issues such as identity, authenticity, otherness, and understanding.</p>



<p>The book has several chapters on his deriving his views from the Jewish thinkers. The book also has a chapter comparing Jewish &amp; Christian views of freedom as well as an interview with Ephraim Meir on the relationship of Jews and Christians.</p>



<p>Finally, and as theoretical grounding for his project, Meir approaches Perry Schmidt-Leukel’s<a> </a>interreligious work as contained in his recent Gifford lectures as a valuable means of interpreting religious diversity.  John Hick created a pluralism in which only the Ultimate Reality is real and religious systems are not, thereby reducing the importance of the differences between religions. Perry Schmidt-Leukel approaches the issue in a new manner using the concept of fractals. Here each religion is a fractal of the Ultimate Reality, recapitulating its structure and at the same time each religion has a fractal relationship to other religions. Each religion is a part of the whole and almost everything reappears in some way in the different religions. Think of a cauliflower, if I break off a floret it has the same basic structure as the entire cauliflower, similarly each floret is similar to the next floret. Applied to religion, the religions are similar in structure therefore one religion can understand another. The pluralism respects the differences between religions as florets but sees a unit in the repeating pattern combined to make a larger pattern.</p>



<p>If you think one religion is a floret and another is an eggplant and a third is a carrot, then this fractal model would not work. Meir’s movement away from the fractal model is two -fold. First, there are many cases of impossibility of dialogue, of fundamental theological differences, and of lack of understanding. All aspects that can only be overcome though dialogue. Secondly, Meir wants to emphasize the ethical, social-relations, and seeking to mend the world more than any philosophic truth claim. Hence, Meir formulates his trans-difference as an ethical alternative to a truth-claim approach. </p>



<p>Which brings me back to my opening. If Meir is basically about social and ethical relationship then the other interfaith models could also work, including comparative theology. &nbsp;I really liked the book in its understanding of dialogue, especially his use of Jewish sources to derive the approach. The book has &nbsp;good Jewish ideas about religion as trust not intellectual assent. There are many gems in Meir’s valuable book, which can be picked out and used elsewhere. I was struck by the value of the book because I am in the middle of collecting my interfaith talks into a small volume and found his Jewish formulation of general interreligious ideas very helpful. I will definatley be using many of his ideas particularly in his reading of Jewish texts in future talks and papers.</p>



<p>I thank Meir for discussing my books for a few pages. He is one of the few who understood my Ricoeur influenced position in those books correctly.&nbsp; However, a Ricoeur position is able to maintain particularity without becoming pluralist while still being comfortable with translation, hybridity, hospitality, and the impact that an encounter with another religion has on a person or system.</p>



<p>The former Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks in the first edition of his <em>Dignity of Difference</em> presented a pluralism in which each religion has its own covenant, its own religious path and morals. God does not want a single unified path, rather we are broken into tribes and peoples. Rabbi Sacks quoted Nathanial ibn Fayumi’s idea that God sent a prophecy to each nation. Ephraim Meir writes that as a philosopher, he is less interested in concepts such as revelation and covenant and more interested in dialogue and pluralism. But most interested in these topics of inter-religious meaning either seek the theological, the wisdom of other faiths,  or the explicit social application.  But those who want a philosophic approach thinking with and around Levinas will enjoy the work.</p>



<h2>Interview with Prof. Ephraim Meir </h2>



<p><strong>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please explain the concept of Faith in the Plural.</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Faith in the Plural&#8221; has a double meaning. First, it is faith in <em>plurality</em>: a plurality of voices and lifestyles is celebrated. One does not just note the existence of the plurality but rejoice in it. Others are approached in a positive way and recognized as different and equal to each other : one may appreciate their unique particularity and learn from their perspective and lifestyle. If you believe that we all live in one world, characterized by diversity, the acts of communicating, translating and extending hospitality become possible.</p>



<p>Secondly, it is <em>faith</em> in plurality: faith exists in the plural. Consequently, different expressions of faith are appraised as revolving around the Transcendent, approached in different ways.</p>



<p>The title of my book &#8220;Faith in the Plural&#8221; implies, therefore, honoring plurality (faith in the <em>plural</em>) &nbsp;and, more specifically, honoring religious plurality (<em>faith</em> in the plural).&nbsp; The first is appreciating the diversity of the world and the second is a fundamental commitment to a philosophic and theological pluralism, similar to John Hick.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is a dialogical approach?</strong></p>



<p>Dialogue follows Peter Berger to embrace the complexity of the world; following Levinas it interrupts one’s monologue, and similar to Paul Knitter strives for social justice.</p>



<p>A dialogical approach allows that the other interrupts one&#8217;s own monologue. In a genuine conversation or meeting, what the other says or does may become relevant for one&#8217;s own position. Dialogue is necessarily transformational. Although dialogue is not always possible, it remains a challenge and opens unexpected perspectives. With their unique make up, persons are also interconnected.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A dialogical or interreligious theology goes beyond sameness and otherness, beyond radical dissimilation and radical assimilation, through respect for different lifestyles and the reality of communication. In search for meaning, dialogical theology is essentially pluralist and, as such, this pluralized theology is an alternative for age-old religious conflicts. Fear of the religious other has been an obstacle for the shaping of a heterogeneous, democratic society. Dialogue overcomes this fear by working with deep listening to others with a view of mending a fractured world by getting involved with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dialogue as I conceive it is not easy. It aims at creating a relational I and a dialogical society in which one strives for equality and social justice. &nbsp;There are limits to dialogue. People can become so entangled with evil that transformation is impossible. With such persons, not dialogue, but justice is needed. With radicalized extremists and (religious) fanatics dialogue is impossible.</p>



<p>Dialogical theology emphasizes interaction between religions in view of the creation of peaceful societies. It is a pluralized theology, in which interreligious dialogue&nbsp; interrupts one&#8217;s own religious narrative and in which interreligious dialogue&nbsp; is transformational, as&nbsp; every authentic dialogue.</p>



<p>Dialogue embraces the complexity of the world, interrupts one&#8217;s own monologue and strives for a democratic society and social justice.</p>



<p><strong>3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What are the characteristics of dialectic theology?</strong></p>



<p>Dialogical theology has a number of characteristics:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>A first condition for dialogical theology is to be <em>humble</em>. Since there are many religious others who organize their lives around the Ineffable, one has to recognize that one is not the only one to talk about what cannot be defined. Humility is required once one realizes that one&#8217;s own religion is only one color in the multicolored garment of Joseph.</li><li>&nbsp;<em>Translation</em> is a second characteristic of dialogical theology. It is an important criterion for a successful interreligious dialogue. Translating is not only a possibility, but also a duty because of the valuable &#8220;trans-different&#8221; relationship with religious others. In a good translation, one avoids radical assimilation without links to what is outside as well as radial dissimilation without bridging that allows for contact. In translation, uniqueness and bridging paradoxically belong together. It implies openness, crossing borders and bridging. Translation is an act of peace because one communicates the own in terms of the other. Because we live in <em>one</em>, shared world, translation and communication are possible and necessary. No religion is so unique that it cannot be understood by people, who do not belong to that religion.</li><li>Respect for the <em>uniqueness</em> of religious others is a third condition of my dialogical theology. Religious others are incomparably unique. There are many ways to the Transcendence. In deep listening to religious others outside and inside our own group, one may learn a lot. There is no other way than one&#8217;s own way. That is true for all those in one&#8217;s own group and for the many others outside our own group. In dialogical theology, uniqueness and translatability are not opposed.</li><li>In dialogical theology, one welcomes the other and allows her to enter into one&#8217;s own world. <em>Extending hospitality</em> to the other and paying visit to the other&#8217;s home are lofty human possibilities that bridge between worlds. Passing to the world of the religious other or allowing the other to visit our world necessarily change us. It may lead to critical questioning of the own tradition and to enriching our personal religious existence. Welcoming the other is basic in all real dialogue.</li><li>Last but not least, <em>learning</em> from the religious other is crucial in interreligious theology. Religious persons who meet religious others may enrich their own spiritual life, reread their own home tradition and creatively shape it.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><strong>4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the concept of trans-difference?</strong></p>



<p>The concept of trans-difference is central in my dialogical theology. It lies at the heart of the interreligious dialogue. The term brings together differences and a bridge between differences. By using this term, I avoid the danger of a closed identity that does not recognize one&#8217;s belonging to the entire world as well as a kind of universality that absorbs particularity.</p>



<p>In trans-difference one belongs to a specific group as well as to the general world. Belonging indicates pertaining to a particular group. It also designated relatedness to universal mankind. The relation between belonging to a singular community and to the broader circle of human kind is sometimes harmonious. Frequently it is characterized by tension and conflicts. Trans-difference combines both realms of belonging. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Trans-difference&#8221; respects different, specific, contextualized viewpoints and, at the same time, promotes connectivity and communication. It affirms differences and goes beyond them in non-indifference. It creates an open, dynamic identity that has otherness in itself.</p>



<p><strong>5)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How is interreligious dialogue testimony (or witness)?</strong></p>



<p>The recognition of the other and the care for her are a &#8220;testimony.&#8221; Testimony  is a fundamental category in the meeting with the religious other. Through the tact of contraction of the I before the other and through deep listening to her,  the glory of the Most High.</p>



<p>Listening to religious others without an agenda is in itself a testimony to the Infinite. By enlarging our religious worldview, we come to a fuller appreciation of the Transcendent. Interreligious dialogue could promote a religiosity based upon human rights and a shared humanity and testify to the intimate relation between divine revelation and mending the world.</p>



<p>Testimony or witness is a clearly religious notion. In my understanding, testimony interrupts a violent way of being, it is a sign, pointing to an elevated, non-violent world. Different religions testify in different ways to the Transcendent and may become a &#8220;sign&#8221; for each other. &#8220;Testimony&#8221; (&#8216;edut) and &#8220;sign&#8221; (nes) are Jewish categories that fit a dialogical theology from a Jewish vantage point.</p>



<p>Inspired by Levinas, I deem that in responding to the other and in the ethical meeting with her, the &#8216;I&#8217; testifies to the Infinite. In Levinas&#8217;s philosophy of the other, the one who says &#8220;Here I am&#8221; before the other testifies to the glory of the Infinite. The &#8216;I&#8217; becomes a witness of the Infinite in taking infinite responsibility of the other. Applying Levinas&#8217;s ethical metaphysics to the field of interreligious dialogue, I conceive true dialogue as a testimony: in openness and non-indifference to and care for the religious other, one bears testimony.&nbsp; Holiness resides in testifying to a God who hears the cries and sees the tears of oppressed people.</p>



<p><strong>6)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happens to truth claims in your approach?</strong></p>



<p>I suggest not to focus upon truth as a complex of sentences with which one has to agree. In Hebrew <em>èmèt</em>, truth, is rather related to trust and confidence. One could focus upon peace, which is higher than truth.</p>



<p>In a dialogical theology, truth comes into being in dialogue. &#8220;Truth sprouts from the earth&#8221; (Ps. 85:11), from beneath, in the pursuit of justice and a good life for all and in dialogue and loving relationships with others. In Jewish thinking, one <em>does</em> the truth. Instead of searching for abstract truth, one may search for a meaningful life and for cross-bordering values. The aim of truth is peace and peace conditions the search for truth. Recognition precedes cognition. Attitudes more than words give access to the Transcendent. In my view, truth is relational and linked to the transformation of the human being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More important than truth claims is the praxis of ethical behavior. The tree is known by its fruits. A rigorous position of the defenders of the gate easily becomes aggressive. We do not know God as He/She/It is. John Hick who created the modern pluralistic position, thought all religions are just attempts to grasp the Real.</p>



<p>The Transcendent &#8211; what John Hick calls the Real &#8211; is &#8220;known&#8221; within human values and within one&#8217;s ethical way of living. All religious traditions have human concepts about the Real (Adonai, the Trinity, Allah, or Vishnu, Brahman, Tao or Nirvana) which are not the Real itself, but rather human responses to the Real. In this perspective, it is forbidden to absolutize any experience of the Transcendent.</p>



<p>Absolute truth claims led, and lead, to much violence and intolerance. History shows that much violence has been done if one defends the exclusivity of one&#8217;s religion or its superiority over other religions, which are seen as false or less true. Absolute truth claims disregard intra- and inter-religious plurality. Dogmatic thinking with a lack of openness may become coercive and exclusive and block the way to a religious search.</p>



<p>The problem with religious people is that often they consider God as their God, without recognizing that their God is also the God of others and that &#8220;no religion is an island,&#8221; as Heschel felicitously phrased it. Another great thinker, Franz Rosenzweig, noted that God did not create religion, he created the world. This makes religions relative; they all exist in view of mending the world. He also adds that God is the truth, in which human beings participate. Truth is always truth-for-us and therefore relative, without relativism. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>7)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is this relativism?</strong></p>



<p>John Hick and the pluralist position does not say that all religions are the same. Hick, and followers of the pluralistic position, are not relativists. Hick merely says that the Real is not what is known from it through our conceptual apparatus and that also others have salvific paths to the Transcendent. &nbsp;He&nbsp; disagrees with the position that one presents one&#8217;s own religion as the only true one. Rather, all religions are an approach to the Transcendent.</p>



<p>One does not have to leave one&#8217;s own religious narrative in order to recognize that diversity has to be accepted and celebrated. Excessive love for the own makes us forget the other. The own religious love story does not prevent one from appreciating the religious love stories of others. It is not relativistic to recognize, as did the Yemenite Jewish theologian Nathanel ben Fayyumi in the 12<sup>th</sup> century, that God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language. More psychologically phrased: different religions correspond to different human needs. </p>



<p>Before my mixed public of Orthodox and non-Othodox Jews I explain that cultures and subcultures have different ways of relating to the Most High</p>



<p><strong>8)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is Schmidt-Leukel’s fractal position?</strong></p>



<p>John Hick was a pioneer who made a Copernican revolution in theology to sees all religions as attempts to understand the transcendental Real.  Theology is a form of poetics and symbols to express the Real.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel&#8217;s interreligious theology continues Hick&#8217;s pluralism. However, Schmidt-Leukel &nbsp;conceives of theology as &#8220;science,&#8221; in search for truth. His emphasis is more upon the cognitive dimension of the diverse beliefs.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel discerns fractal patterns in the various religions following Benoît Mendelbrot, who used the term &#8220;fractals&#8221; for patterns that display self-similarity across various scales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With his &#8220;fractal&#8221;&#8216; interpretation of religions, Perry argues that there is a fractal face also in cultural and religious diversity. His fractal interpretation of religious diversity is on the inter-religious, intra-religious and intra-subjective levels. He claims that the diversity <em>among</em> religions is also present <em>within</em> the religions and within the religious orientation of individuals. If one follows his argument, the different religions (and cultures) are less separated than might be thought at first sight: they have regular structures that return, but also irregularities that point to different contexts and arrangements.</p>



<p>Already Wilfred Cantwell Smith called for a world theology or global theology. Perry&#8217;s creative, pluralist &#8220;interreligious theology&#8221; perceives fractal structures in the religious diversity and encourages interreligious comparisons and learning.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel&#8217;s model is unity in diversity, unity in difference. He claims that &#8220;[r]eligions resemble each other, but they resemble each other in their diversity.&#8221; His main point is that, if religions are not intelligible to each other, we could not understand other cultures at all: religions are never totally other. He assesses diversity and complementarity. Different religious types are all part of the human experience. This phenomenological view allows for comparability.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel&#8217;s model of interreligious theology greatly contributed to the pluralist revolution in theology in offering a theory that explains the interconnectedness of religions and the possibility of interreligious learning.</p>



<p>9) <strong>Where do you differ from Schmidt-Leukel’s fractal position?</strong></p>



<p>I agree with Perry that comparability is possible since our own experience is part of the experiences of humankind. With my &#8220;trans-difference,&#8221; I interpret religious uniqueness differently.</p>



<p>First, in my view, this does not mean that everything is comparable. Certain incommensurabilities preclude the translatability of all things into something else, as well as the reduction of all otherness to structurally identical or analogous elements. My point is that, just as languages possess words and expressions that are idiomatic, religions have an otherness that is not reducible to sameness.</p>



<p>Perry looks for compatibilities in order to create a communication platform. To my mind, some elements in religions are not compatible with each other, not overlapping and not parallel, but rather radically different. I agree that translating religious categories is a possibility and even a necessity, but should less than complete comprehensibility and complete transparency not be possible? The Jewish love of the Law, for example, greatly differs &nbsp;from the Christian freedom as free from the Law. From a Jewish vantage point, the Christian recognition and appreciation of this Jewish specificity is vital in the Jewish-Christian encounter.</p>



<p>Perry too recognizes limited incommensurable elements in religions, but his emphasis is more on comparability and translatability than on incomparable uniqueness. Consciousness of uniqueness does not necessarily lead to feelings of exclusivity or superiority. In fact, recognition of the uniqueness of religious others is a constituent in my dialogical theology, which combines uniqueness and sharing a common world.</p>



<p>Second, my interreligious dialogical theology is much more deed-centered than Perry&#8217;s. I interpret interreligious pluralism in an ethical way.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My dialogical theology comes closer to Paul Knitter&#8217;s soteriocentric model, which combines a theology of religions with a strong commitment to mend the world. In my dialogical theology, I put the emphasis upon genuine, transformational dialogue, in which the question whether theological utterances are compatible with each other is less important than the moral quality present in the various responses to the inconceivable reality.</p>



<p><strong>10)&nbsp; What is an ethical interpretation of interreligious pluralism?</strong></p>



<p>With his creative and sophisticated fractal interpretation of religious diversity, Perry Schmidt-Leukel conceives theology as a &#8220;science,&#8221; in search for truth. His emphasis is upon the cognitive dimension of the diverse beliefs.</p>



<p>My dialogical theology is more about trust than about truth. Dialogical theology involves deep listening and perfecting society by getting involved with (religious) others. In this pluralized theology, peace is more elevated than truth and does not have to retreat before truth. It is rather the result of the common search for meaning, which is present in different religious groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I emphasize the ethical dimension in the different religions. From my perspective, the aim of truth is to bring peace. To be attentive to the other and take care of her is above the rational order of truth.</p>



<p>Perry has a logocentric fractal interpretation of religious plurality. My interreligious theology is characterized by a deed-centered approach to religions.</p>



<p>A pluralized theology is not primarily the result of knowing more religions or knowing them better (although that is important too), it is first of all about <em>re</em>cognition of the other. Being present to religious others and listening to them without hidden agenda is a &#8220;testimony&#8221; to the Infinite. By enlarging our religious world, we come to a fuller appreciation of the Transcendent, approachable in care for the other human being.</p>



<p><strong>11)&nbsp; You quote a wide variety of Jewish pluralists, are you basically in agreement with them? Your list includes among others the diverse approaches of Kogan, and Zalman-Schachter-Shalomi?</strong></p>



<p>One may cherish and love one&#8217;s own religion and, at the same time, take seriously the encounter with religious others. Travelling in a multi-religious world does not diminish in any way love for the own religion, in which and from which one lives. We shape our identities, but we are also shaped by others, intra- and inter-religiously.</p>



<p>Michael Kogan in his <em>Opening the Covenant</em> (Oxford 2007) seeks to include Christianity within God’s covenant with Jewish people.  He quotes Paul in 1Cor. 9:22 who claims that he became “all things to all people so that by all means some might be saved” and asks “why cannot God do the same thing?” For Kogan, “all faith are true that lead us from egocentricity to participation in the infinite life with all its ethical and spiritual blessings.” I am in agreement with his pluralist view that God reveals different truth to different peoples in different historical circumstances. Kogan opens up the covenant and develops a multiple revelation theory, which states that others too have a covenant with God. He is also right in writing that Catholic ecclesiolatry, Protestant scriptolatry and Jewish ethnolatry want to replace the infinite with finite forms. Kogan formulates his pluralism in this way. I do not work with different revelations or covenants, but with the term “trans-difference,” which is a philosophical notion, more fitting for a dialogical theology.</p>



<p>Zalman Schachter-Shalomi develops Jewish theological insights on Jesus. A Jewish look at the Gospels is relevant for those Christians, who want to understand Jesus better in his Jewish historical and cultural setting. For instance, Buber&#8217;s view on Jesus, as developed in his <em>Two Types of Faith</em>, is useful for Christians, who frequently interpret Jesus in light of later dogmatic developments. Buber situated Jesus in the series of Suffering Servants. Schachter-Shalomi goes beyond the historical Jesus who preached good moral behavior and see him as &#8220;axis mundi&#8221; for his followers. According to Schachter-Shalomi, Kabbalah offers a model of divine embodiment. In this perspective, Jesus is an &#8220;incarnate of Torah.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Schachter-Shalomi&#8217;s view on a more transcendent Jesus differs from the classical Jewish one, which takes distance from the divinization of finite human beings. Yet, what is forbidden for Jews can be allowed for non-Jews. The views of Kogan &amp; Schachter-Shalomi go beyond a confessional Jewish theology. They interact with Christianity and engage in a dialogue with Christians.   </p>



<p><strong>12)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happens to a fixed religious identity in your approach?</strong></p>



<p>In my view, &#8220;trans-difference&#8221; creates an open identity that has otherness in itself. The loftiness of the human being resides in the realization that the I is always linked to the non-I and that interconnectedness ruptures one&#8217;s totalizing tendencies. Interconnectedness brings us out of our cocoon, in humble service of the other. This a life long task.</p>



<p>However, frequently, religious persons define themselves in contrast to others. Religious others are often met with animosity and a-priori assumptions instead of sympathetic listening. The alternative for such a fixed religious identity is a dynamic identity, open to others. In a dynamic religious identity, one discovers that one belongs to the entire world, in which a plurality of religions testifies to the Transcendent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A dialogical theology is about crossing borders and leaving fixed identities in openness to others, without losing one&#8217;s own embedment in concrete cultural and historical contexts. In dialogue with religious others, one may become conscious that many other traditions also approach the Transcendent in their own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Religious identities are linked to religious traditions. However, these traditions are ambiguous. Ideally, they are a dynamic process and develop continually. Practically, they are frequently absolutized. Traditions should be conscious that they are not the divine source itself, but only a response to it. As other human realities, they may reflect divine realities that become manifest in human connectivity. They may also become inhuman, violent and cruel. The million dollar question is if religious traditions will be able to exercise self-contraction and give room to each other. Traditions may instrumentalize the Transcendent in function of the own interests, producing shaming, blaming, exclusion, discrimination, violence and war. They may serve themselves as particularistic traditions, divorced from values. Alternatively, they are particular expressions of a universal bond in favor of a unified humanity. The choice is between love of the own by excluding the other or cultivate a universal belonging in one&#8217;s own unique way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The success of dialogical theology depends upon the elasticity and willingness of (the adherents to) traditions to connect to the Divine through peaceful and dialogical relationships. One may creatively revisit and reimagine the own tradition in light of what one learns from others. A critical participation in a religious tradition allows for experiencing, experimenting, creativity and change. A non fixed, dynamic identity avoids making a caricature of the other and creates the possibility of an expanded &#8220;we.&#8221; It places relationality again at the heart of the religious experience.</p>



<p><strong>13)&nbsp; What does the Rabbinic concept of chosen people mean?</strong></p>



<p>Chosenness is something positive: it is the privilege of having duties. In traditional Jewish life and thought, God loves the Jewish people &#8220;with great love.&#8221; Before the reading of the Torah, we bless God &#8220;who has chosen us from all the nations.&#8221; Love is always linked to chosenness. One is chosen in order to be responsible for others. In this sense, every human being is chosen to be there for others. Chosenness is not haughtiness, it is rather an election to be in dialogical relation with the (religious) others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
