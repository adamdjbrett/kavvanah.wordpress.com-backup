<p>This is the second response the interview with <a href="../../../16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/index.html">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye- here, </a>the first response was by <a href="../../../19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/index.html">Levi Morrow- here. </a></p>



<p>Rabbi Dr. Zohar Atkins  (<a href="https://www.thelehrhaus.com/author/zoharatkins/">here </a>and <a href="https://hartman.org.il/Faculty_View.asp?faculty_id=301&amp;Cat_Id=333&amp;Cat_Type=About">here</a>) is the founder of Etz Hasadeh and a Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America. He holds a DPhil in Theology from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and semikha from JTS. He is the author of a philosophic work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theological-Appropriation-Heideggers-Critique-Modernity/dp/3319969161">An Ethical and Theological Appropriation of Heidegger’s Critique of Modernity </a>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) and a book of poetry <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nineveh-Zohar-Atkins/dp/1784107395/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1569284600&amp;sr=1-1">Nineveh (Carcanet, 2019</a>). He is the author of a weekly d’var Torah newsletter: tinyletter.com/etzhasadeh</p>



<p><a href="http://kenissa.org/national-gatherings/national-consultations/2019-national-consultation/building-communities-2019/">His organization <em>Etz Hasadeh</em> </a> is both an emergent community oriented around the existential study of Jewish texts, philosophy, and poetry, and a lab for rethinking the field of Jewish education writ large. We promote the development of personalized, psychologically inflected, existential meaning-making skills. Etz Hasadeh offers an intervention in the way Tanakah and Rabbinic literature are taught and studied, clearing the way for a ​<em>poetic </em>​approach to learning that empowers students to engage ancient images and ideas as metaphors for the challenges of contemporary life.</p>



<p>In this response essay, Zohar Atkins has several points.
First, and easiest to grasp, is that the term postmodernism is difficult to
define and may ultimately be more of a mood than a theory. Second, and more
substantively, Torah is about continuity, tradition, mesorah, and grounded
readings, not skepticism and the limits of knowledge. Therefore, to Atkin’s ear
much of the discussion of consensus, self-acceptance, and progressive
revelation sound like 19<sup>th</sup> century opinions of the followers of Zechariah
Frankel. </p>



<p>Third, postmodernism is clearly not Existentialism,
and Franz Rosenzweig already rejected the early 20<sup>th</sup> century idea of
living “as if” as inauthentic. Fourth, he finds problems with Feldmann-Kaye’s
use of Heidegger who rejected humanism and instead sought an opening to truth,
an unconcealing of Being allowing us to think.  </p>



<p>Atkins does try to explain the use of postmodernism as
a way of saying “God wants us to be incapable of finding God. Postmodernism is
just another name for <em>Galut Edom</em>, the Roman Exile.” Yet, he
concludes that: “these flights of poetic fancy are not postmodern, they are
fundamentalist, mythic.” For Atkins, postmodernism has to treat every myth as
an idol. Atkins defines the task of the contemporary religious philosopher to
live “shuttling back and forth” with “an agon with myth for philosophy and an
agon with philosophy for myth. Postmodern theology, thus, is a relishing of
myth and a relishing of demythologization, yet it is an endeavor that, to me,
seems like it can only be idiosyncratic, and a source of great dissonance.”</p>



<p>Finally, Atkins considers thinking “a form of <em>avodah, </em>is a holy, religious task” in which engagement with postmodern thought is necessary. He appreciated the “effort to amplify and beatify Torah (<em>yagdil Torah v’adir</em>),” by placing “it in conversation with the wisdom and insights of other traditions,” in this case postmodernism.  He is deeply committed to the horizons of our lived Torah. For him, “Torah should speak to everything we know, love, and experience.”</p>

<p><strong>Defining Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>Postmodernism is notoriously—though perhaps appropriately—difficult to define.<br> Is it a school of thought? A literary style propounded by a set of thinkers, writers, artists (often French)? A worldview rooted in skepticism so radical it always becomes its own object of critique? An aesthetic that fuses avant-garde and pop, a la Andy Warhol, Frank O’Hara, John Cage, and Lady Gaga? A historical epoch dating to 1968? A fancy or pretentious synonym for <em>contemporary? </em>A way of saying <em>modernism mamash </em> (<em>really</em> modernism)? </p>



<p><br>
If postmodernism is defined as an aversion to fixed labels and determinacy, is
there any purchase to the term—<em>l’shitato—</em>according to its own standards,
or is it a self-cancelling term, like a witness who comes before a court and
says, “I am an unreliable witness”? Perhaps it is impossible to write about
postmodernism; “one cannot look upon its face and live.”</p>



<p><br> If I were postmodern, I cannot be said to have an identity; rather identity is something I perform. There is no self, just presentation. To be a subject is to be a prisoner of the social order; my name-dropping does not actually refer to thinkers out there in the world, but only to the act of citation itself, a gesture, a miming of authority. In this sense, the string of proper names, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, is no different than those found in, say, a song with many names in the lyrics.</p>



<p>One reason for the confusion is that one of
postmodernism’s chief proponents, Jean Francois Lyotard, defined
(paradoxically) the postmodern condition as the end of “grand narratives.” Yet
in so doing, Lyotard set up his own grand narrative, in which modernism was
said to be naive and postmodernism was presented as the end of history. In this
way, postmodernism’s self-representation is no different than the bombastic
pronouncements of Nietzsche’s Zarathustra or Hegel’s Absolute Spirit; I suppose
the main difference is the way in which these earlier iterations still aspired
at some ideal, whereas postmodernism aspired to pursue with one hand what it
took away with the other.</p>



<p>If Derrida has become a poster child for
postmodernism, then perhaps what distinguishes postmodern thought from its
critical antecedents is less its content than its mood, the mood of
disenchantment, levity, comedy, neurosis, anti-messianism; or as Derrida put it
“messianism without messianicity.”</p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism and Judaism </strong></p>



<p>When Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the Roman Emperor
Vespasian for a yeshiva in Yavneh (Gittin 56b) he exchanged politically doomed
Temple-based Judaism for a new paradigm of Jewish life. Sometimes postmodernism
is presented in this way.</p>



<p>Yet if rabbinic Judaism saw itself as continuous with
its historical past, and still, at times, looked nostalgically to the figure of
the Temple in its fantasies, postmodernists emphasized and venerated <em>rupture</em>,
as implied in their prefix “post-”. Never mind that the slogan of literary
modernism was “make it new” (<a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/the-making-of-making-it-new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezra
Pound, translating an ancient Confucian sage</a>); never mind that montage and
irony and indeterminacy and ambiguity were already important conceits before
postmodernism became a cultural shibboleth. Never mind that skepticism is an
ancient tradition, that subjectivism took off with Descartes, that pragmatism
was a Neo-Kantian idea already popularized by William James in the 19th century,
or that the so-called “linguistic turn” can be traced to Wittgenstein, a
modernist, if not earlier to Herder, Schlegel, and the romantic movement?</p>



<p>The ubiquity and unclarity of the term <em>postmodern</em> means
that it often does more harm than help when appended to another term such as
“Jewish thought” or “Jewish theology.” Does postmodern Jewish thought mean
thought that is influenced by postmodern thinkers, thought that simply occurs
in a historic period known as postmodern, or thought that is treated by critics
as having the worst signature features of postmodern writing, namely,
convolution, sophistry, relativism, a “retreat from judgment” (Arendt), etc.?
The term is so contested that it is probably better just to say what one means
than make appeal to this proper name; though one thing shared by postmoderns
through their debt to Quintillian, Schlegel, and Kierkegaard, is that it is
impossible to say what one means; to think we can is to commit the “intentional
fallacy.” “There is nothing outside the text” (Derrida). </p>



<p>Even here, though, postmodern analysis proves no
different than its modernist antecedents; for whether the analysis is
structuralist or post-structuralist, Freudian or Foucauldian, the point is that
the interpreter, and not the text itself, holds the key to its interpretation.
In some ways this posture is quite compatible with a certain understanding of
oral Torah, whereby the meaning of the written Torah falls to the rabbis rather
than, say, the karaites, historians, or philologists. At the same time, the
sages of the Talmud still sought to ground their arguments in a reading of
verses from the Written Torah, and subsequently, in the precedent readings of
earlier sages.</p>



<p>I am not an expert in the thought of Tamar Ross or Rav
Shagar, yet I am a great admirer of anyone who, in an effort to amplify and
beatify Torah (<em>yagdil Torah v’adir</em>), places it in conversation with the
wisdom and insights of other traditions; Torah should speak to everything we
know, love, and experience. And even if Western thought is a kind of Exile, we
should take comfort in knowing that “the divine presence goes into Exile with
us.” Whether Ross, Shagar, and their expositor, Miriam Feldmann Kaye, succeed
or fail, we should applaud their effort at <em>kiddush hashem, </em>of
sanctifying (the Jewish) God. They follow the example of Maimonides, who said
that if Aristotle’s thought were true, the Torah would have to be read in light
of Aristotelian philosophy, and whose thought was, for a time, accused of being
heretical until it became a dominant school of Jewish thought. </p>



<p>The irony and self-contradiction of a postmodern
Torah, however, is the way in which it challenges the commonsense view of
truth. How can the critique of truth itself be true? What is meant by “truth”?</p>



<p>Reading Feldmann Kaye’s interview, my impression is
that she/Ross regards postmodernism in a positive light as the doctrine that
truth is decided through intersubjective agreement. To me, though, that’s not
postmodernism at all, but positivism, and I don’t see how it’s much different
than the historicist view established by the Conservative movement in the 19th
century. Perhaps the fundamental claim that revelation is ongoing, is
culturally rooted, is emergent, is not different in kind, but only in degree,
from the ideas of Zechariah Frankel. Majority rules is not postmodern, its just
liberal. <em>Minhag yisrael halachah hi </em>(the customs of Israel are
legally binding)—is no different than <em>Vox populi Vox Dei </em>or
Rousseau’s theory of the general will. We find the norm of law by consensus in
the Talmud; but law is not truth; and saying there are many truths a la
postmodernism is different than saying we can’t know the one truth; the former
is an ontological claim, while the later is an epistemological one.</p>



<p>For non-specialists for whom the above sounds rather
dense, let’s just put it this way, Franz Rosenzweig criticizes the view that
truth is decided by human will as “as if thinking,” a form of theological
hedging whereby the non-believer says that the only way to live a good life is
to act <em>as if </em>God exists. If postmodern Jewish theology is “as
if” thinking, is Pascal’s wager 2.0, I find it weak. If postmodern theology
just means existentialist religiosity, it’s both hardly new, and hardly
radical. Kierkegaard and Rebbe Nachman share the view that one cannot have
certain knowledge of anything, yet this self-skepticism becomes a tool for
motivating a leap of faith that, unsurprisingly, is outwardly quite submissive
to dogma and the protocols of religious observance. The only thing that
distinguishes a religious existentialist and a regular <em>eved hashem</em> is
the existentialist’s emphasis on <em>interiority</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Non-Foundationalism </strong></p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye invokes non-foundationalism as a
hallmark of both postmodern thought and postmodern Jewish thought, yet ends up
defining it in a foundationalist way as the agreement of people on what the
truth is. </p>



<p>For Heidegger, truth is “unconcealment,” not social
reality, which he sometimes derides as “hearsay” in <em>Being and
Time, </em>nor is truth some kind of individual experience a la the
romantics. Meanwhile, for Nietzsche, truth is perspectival, yet it is the task
of strong artists and thinkers to will their truth into existence by exercising
a will to power; consensus is for the herd of half-dead unoriginals who are
still too bound up with “slave morality,” whether they be religious
fundamentalists or bourgeois secularists (or, as we now see in our day, bourgeois,
religious fundamentalists). Heidegger is a non-foundationalist insofar as he
rejects systematic thought based on first principles, yet the reason for this
rejection is not because he is skeptic, but because he believes foundationalism
is ontologically impoverished, does not enable us to properly think, and
therefore, flourish. </p>



<p>If non-foundationalism means we keep the Torah “simply
because” we are thrown into a heritage, rather than because we have good
rational reasons and justifications that can withstand critical (Western)
enquiry, this is a kind of honest, modest, and yet Rube-Goldbergish way of
utilizing academic thinkers to basically follow in the footsteps of Rebbe
Nachman’s simpleton (see the story “chacham and tam”). It’s good therapy for
people who are born into a thick knowledge of and commitment to Jewish life,
but it is unlikely to win any one over; perhaps this is its virtue—it’s
anti-patronizing, nice, polite pc liberalism. I happen to be a slave to God and
you happen not to be, but, hey, these are both just lifestyles we inherited
from our families. </p>



<p>If you believe that God revealed <em>everything </em>to
Moses, all the oral law, and all the principles for expounding it, it is very
difficult to make sense of the story in Menachot 29b in which Moses sits,
confused, in the back of R. Akiva’s classroom. If Rabbi Akiva is so great,
Moses asks, why wasn’t the Torah given to him? “Be quiet. Such did it come to
me.” </p>



<p>One might be tempted to ask, similarly, why God did
not reveal postmodern thought to Moses; why did God wait for our generation to
reveal postmodern philosophy? To ask such a question, though, is to go crazy,
for it is the kind of question that postmodern thought forbids asking with a
straight face (it is somehow less absurd to ask why God waited to reveal
relativity theory to Einstein). </p>



<p>On the other hand, if we translate it into metaphysical terms, we can say that God wants us to be incapable of finding God. Postmodernism is just another name for <em>Galut Edom</em>, the Roman Exile. But these flights of poetic fancy are not postmodern, they are fundamentalist, mythic. Postmodernism is monotheistic insofar as it treats every myth as an idol, even the myths of Sinai and the myths of an unbroken <em>mesorah</em>. My shuttling back and forth represents not postmodern theology, but an agon with myth for philosophy and an agon with philosophy for myth. Philosophy<a> </a>sought to defang myth; religion is the submission to it. To be a religious philosopher is to defang and submit at once, to make a myth of defanging while defanging it. Postmodern theology, thus, is a relishing of myth and a relishing of demythologization, yet it is an endeavor that, to me, seems like it can only be idiosyncratic, and a source of great dissonance. If I were an amora, I would suggest that this dissonance is divinely prescribed, that philosophy corresponds to the first set of (broken) tablets and myth to the second (whole) set, both of which were kept in the ark together. And if I were an amora (playing Abaye to my own Rava) I would counter, and say the first set refers to myth while the second set refers to philosophy. Teiku.</p>



<p><strong>Use of Heidegger and Derrida in the
Interview </strong></p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye’s invocation of Heidegger is a tease;
little besides the name Heidegger is given to us that suggests what a
Heideggerian approach to revelation could involve, but even if there were, it
is arguable whether Heidegger can be called postmodern. He is certainly viewed
that way, negatively by Allan Bloom and positively by Richard Rorty. I have no
doubt that Heidegger has much to contribute to contemporary Jewish life and
thought, but none of the views espoused by Feldmann Kaye in the name of Shagar
and Ross fit Heidegger’s thought too well, and none reflect a deep
phenomenological influence; the value of cultural particularism is not unique
to Heidegger and Heidegger would have eviscerated terms like “culture” and
“experience” as remaining caught in a retrograde metaphysics of “humanism.”</p>



<p>When you compare Derrida to Heidegger, besides the
linguistic and political differences, you find a tonal difference. Heidegger’s
mood is heroic, tragic, messianic; Derrida’s is playful, jestful, cerebral.
Heidegger and Derrida are both gnomic writers; yet one senses with Heidegger
that he has something serious to say; with Derrida, one senses that the
performance is the point, that there is nothing besides the rhetoric. In
Heidegger, rhetoric serves the purpose of thought. In Derrida, one feels, there
is nothing besides rhetoric. Derrida scholars can disagree; Heidegger reads as
a reluctant spiritual Master, as a thinker. Derrida reads as a comedian, as
Aristophanes to Heidegger’s Socrates, which isn’t to say Derrida isn’t serious
or that there isn’t a seriousness to his jocularity, or that he doesn’t have
something to say. Still, one never feels levity reading terms like <em>Seinsfrage,
Geworfenheit</em>, <em>Erschlossenheit</em>, <em>die Frage nach dem
Technik</em>; meanwhile, Derrida’s essays seem haughtily pitched to deflate
everything of its gravity, as if any form of seriousness were somehow in danger
of becoming an instrument of fascism. One can certainly make the argument that
Heidegger is postmodern or else presages postmodern thought, yet his
aesthetic—even when playful, even when self-questioning—has a devotional
quality to it. We should consider whether postmodern Jewish thought and life
require us to be jesters in the Derridean mold or pietist in the Heideggerian
one. In the end, the issue of postmodernism might be one of tone and aesthetics
more than content (after all, postmodernism can also be framed as a privileging
of form and frame over content, e.g., “the medium is the message.”)</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>



<p>For those of us who aspire to think, who believe it is of the utmost import, and who, as Jews, or as religious folk, believe that thinking is a form of <em>avodah, </em>is a holy, religious task, engagement with postmodern thought is necessary. It may be necessary even as a Jacob’s ladder we climb and then kick away. I don’t believe postmodern thought often succeeds in “thinking,” yet I believe it helps us spot the ways in which we are not yet thinking, and this humility is needed today, not just for ethical and political reasons, but also for spiritual ones. To know that one is not yet thinking, is this not <em>the awe of heaven?</em></p>



<p>I am grateful to Miriam Feldmann Kaye for introducing the question of postmodernism into the contemporary discussion of Jewish thought and theology, not because I believe postmodernism can save Jewish life or thought (I’m not sure any doctrine, even an anti-doctrinaire one could do this), but because the question of how to live a sincere, elevated, responsible, pious Jewish life that is critical, self-critical, and open-minded, is upon us.</p>
