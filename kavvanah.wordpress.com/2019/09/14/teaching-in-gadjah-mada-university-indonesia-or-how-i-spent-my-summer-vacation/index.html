<p>This past summer I taught a graduate course in comparative mysticism at <a href="http://icrs.ugm.ac.id/">University Gadjah Mad</a>a in their <a href="https://crcs.ugm.ac.id/">Center for Religious and Cross-cultural Studies</a> in Yogyakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia. In addition, and maybe more significantly, I spoke at a variety of Islamic colleges (&amp; Christian and Hindu colleges). Indonesia is the 4<sup>th</sup> largest country in the world and it is the largest Islamic country in the world.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The goal was to bring them a knowledge of Judaism in order to clear up misconceptions and to foster a more receptive attitude to Judaism. I was sponsored by Gadjah Mada University and by the AJC-API (American Jewish Committee -Asia Pacific Institute) for the University teaching and sponsored by Gadjah Mada University and the regional Islamic colleges for my important travel to give talks. </p>

<p>University Gadjah Mada is the major center for the study of religion in Indonesia and is the feeder school producing the faculty of the Indonesian Islamic colleges. I stayed in a lovley guest house a mile from the university and walked to work each day down the main shopping avenue. </p>



<p>In my class, I covered contemporary approaches to mysticism such as Michel de Certeau, Jeffrey Kripal, and Amy Hollywood, then the theory was applied to mystical texts from the Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions. &nbsp;I taught a course in mysticism since it complements the Indonesia emphasis on mysticism as a main rubric for self-understanding of their own religion and as an easy way to introduce Judaism into the curriculum since I spent about 40% of the classes discussing Judaism. I was specifically brought to introduce the Judaism into this major graduate program of religion, which because of its status as a feeder school producing MA’s and Phd’s who go into administration and teaching in Islamic colleges. </p>



<p>Indonesia is
predominately an easy-going hybrid Islam oriented more toward local traditions
of the arts and devotion than law. By their own estimates, no more than 25% of
my classroom prayed daily, let alone five times a day. They said it was between
them and God. They said they all fasted during Ramadan but did not go to
prayers. </p>



<p>They like Sufism but
are not into Sufi saints or graves. They read the Sufi mystics Ibn Arabi and
Mulla Sadra about the “unity of being” (waḥdat al-wujūd) in which all of
creation is a manifestation of the divine. But they also accepted as meaningful
to their Indonesia Islam the universal Sufism of the West, including Inayat
Khan, Idries Shah and Robert Frager. This acceptance of western universal Sufism
by Indonesian is similar to going to Monsey NY and finding the Chassidim
reading Buber.</p>



<p>My syllabus included
the Jewish Sufism of Bahye, Ovadiah ben Avraham ben Maimonies, Isaac of Acco,
and Eliyahu deVidas as a bridge topic to show a Judaism that was similar to
their Islam before I turned to the Zohar and Hasidism. We also covered
Christian Kabbalah as a hybrid form of Kabbalah because their own conceptions of
religion are about hybridity. </p>



<p>Indonesia was founded
on the motto of “unity in diversity” and has Pancasila as an official ideology
in which one must accept one God, revelation through a prophet and scripture.
The government has determined that the six official religions that follow this
are Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. It
is a world where Muslim acknowledge Hindus and Buddhists as having one God and
where conversely Hindus and Buddhists see themselves as having one God,
revelation, and scripture. </p>



<p>Pancasila was legally mandated from the founding of the state until 20 years ago. Now, it is still accepted but has many interpretations and variants. How much&nbsp;it is social policy as opposed to theology is debated; one finds explanations of this as a policy of social cohesion and for others it is a liberal and tolerant reading of Islamic theology. The country uses the phrase “God almighty” in official events to refer to all six religions.</p>



<p>The Islamic focus on tawhid-
divine unity remains in place but also includes the other religions. Tribal
religion is treated as culture and folkways- not as theology or religion- so those
practices can be integrated into any of the six. The tribes were basically made
to pick one of the faith for their identity cards, Depending on the region they
chose Christian, Muslim, or Hindu.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Jews are not included in this list anymore since there are not many Jews in Indonesia. They were briefly included at the founding of the state before they emigrated to Australia and the U.S. There is a trend of recent conversions to Judaism clustered in several cities, which deserves its own discussion. (In the meantime, read the two articles <a href="https://azjewishpost.com/2019/48224/">here</a> and <a href="https://azjewishpost.com/2019/indonesia-revisited-synagogue-welcomes-shabbat-visitors/?fbclid=IwAR23d1PPSTIKgNZ-yDLBThxpLYlsm6uJCDQbJ0Z3kH78qqiaNfrTFL6UIR8">here)</a></p>



<p>There are also Muslim
who study Hebrew and Jewish books as Judeophiles. Many of the latter reached
out to me before I arrived when they read the announcement of my arriving. </p>



<p>My own host professor
at the university and co-instructor is one of these Judeophiles. He is Christian,
teaches Judaism, and has been on The Brandeis Schusterman program for Israel
studies. He even translated Heschel&#8217;s <em>The Sabbath</em> into Indonesian and
could not find a publisher because there was no market.</p>



<p>However as I write this,
I note that Americans tend to know little about Indonesia and few college
students study Indonesian. Sufism is a good way to introduce Indonesian Islam
before I speak directly about the Islamic colleges. </p>



<p><strong>Indonesian </strong><strong>Sufism</strong></p>



<p>The East Java city of Kediri is
on the site of an 8th century Hindu city and is now an Islamic factory town,
known as the headquarters of the leading brand of Indonesian cigarettes, mainly
clove cigarettes. When I visited Kediri to speak in an Islamic college, my
hosts graciously took me to the shrine of Sufi Sheykh Sulaiman Al-Wasil
Syamsudin. The shrine is downtown right near the bus station and main hotel
owned by the cigarette company.</p>

<p><br /> In the 12th century, Sheykh Al-Wasil Syamsudin brought Sufism and Islamic teaching to Kediri in East Java from Persia. His Sufism included astrology and fortune-telling. In the 16th century, a Chinese Buddhist style enclosure was built around his tomb with Hindu and Buddhist temple ornamentation. The shire has an actual inscription about his work in old Javanese. The tomb is in the middle of a small graveyard. Around the graveyard is a mosque, community cemetery and concessions for Islamic ritual objects.</p>



<p>When I visited at ten PM
there were only two men reciting Quran as a remembrance of God near the tomb
and another two or three women behind a curtain. There is no set ritual to be
done there. Outside the shrine, there were a few tables with literature from
the various local Sufi organizations who venerate the shrine. Finally, as in
Turkey, there were shops for sweetened Turkish style coffee in glasses.</p>



<p>Around the shrine, one sees
items of the broader syncretic faith of Java. These include a mural of the
Chinese goddess of the sea on the wall of one of the shrine’s building,
Javanese Gamelan instruments, holy water for ritual in the Hindu style., and a
“Cambodian tree” as a place to pray for marriage (like Amukah in the Galilee).
This syncretism is characteristic of traditional Javanese Islam; one that does
not worry about purity, legalism, or other faiths. This syncretism was
important for me to see with my own eyes.</p>



<p>Clifford Geertz, the
important anthropologist, considering true Islam as centered on law (fiqh) based
on his knowledge of Islam in Morocco, and therefore saw Javanese Islam as an
Islamic veneer over Javanese traditional religion. More recent scholars such as
Mark Woodward reverses it and makes Islam as the primary religious category,
which uses the local cultural blend of a Hindu-Buddhist-animist practices as ways
to be Muslim. </p>



<p>Sufism is an alternate
fundamental mode of Islam that is alternative to the version we know based on
law. This is the primary mode of Islam in the Islam of Kediri. The Quran and
Hadith are read in Sufi terms. It is strictly Muslim, in that, Muslims use
Islamic prayer modes and chant Quran, Javanese Hindus and Christians do not.
But Islam is embedded in Javanese culture. For greater detail, consult the
experts on Indonesian Islam who have produced a vast secondary literature.</p>



<p>This Sufi Islam that accepts
the practices of the local Javanese culture is rather mellow, pluralistic,
irenic, and accepting of its cultural setting. In addition, Java also has many
nominal Muslims, without Islamic practice or knowledge. I will talk more about
it when I discusses the colleges that I visited and people I had personal
discussion with about Islam. But it is important to note how mellow is their
tradition flavor of Islam. One of my colleagues at the University, recently
wrote a paper showing how Islam is compatible with animism. A paper that is
border line between empirical observation and creating a progressive 21st
century Islamic political theology that embraces tribal religions. </p>



<p>Since I taught mysticism, I
found out quickly from both my classroom students, and subsequently from
readings, that Indonesian Sufism and mysticism to them is not the sublime
unitive mystical experience of William James or an inner meaning as described by
the classic books on Arabic and Persian Sufism. Rather they used the word
mysticism for any religious experience or connection to religious or ritual
forces. The terms in Indonesia are kebatinan, which in class they used for any religious
experience and kepercayaan for relgious faith. </p>



<p>Ritual done by Sufis is seen
as having powers and blessings. And Sufi leaders, for their followers, have
supernatural powers. People want the blessing (Karamat) and become Sufis. For
Geertz, this was a native Javanese animism with an Islamic veneer and for
current trends it is clearly Islamic Sufism making use of local language and
practices.</p>



<p>There are many Sufi groups in
the city of Kediri. The major groups recruit the male adolescents at the
Islamic boarding schools and are traditional quoting Al Ghazali and requiring
the following of Islamic precepts. However, there are others ranging from those
that include women and children, to those that recruit through social media for
outreach, and there are those that primarily cater to addicts and criminals.
Some allow non-Muslims to attend. Some of them only meet at the shrine and not
in a mosque because the nominal Muslims do not feel comfortable in the
normative in the Mosque.</p>



<p>In general, the Sufi
directive is that everything one does should be for God, “Le- allah” and one
should think of god in all you do. Similar to the parallel concepts in Hasidut
and Neo-Hasidut. According to the books about Kediri Sufism, even for the
traditional groups, they assume if something is not forbidden in the Quran then
it is permitted.</p>



<p>They do not relate to
stringency of later generations. Most of the Sufi groups care little about
later Arabic fatwas or later fiqh. I received similar answers from the Muslim
graduate students in my classroom or local Muslims in Jogja (Yogyakarta). If
you asked them about how they relate to anti-Christian (or Jewish or Hindu)
writings of the medieval ibn Taymiyyah (or other conservative Islamic
thinkers), they answered that it is not Hadith and does not apply to them or
that they are not Salafi so he does not matter.</p>



<p>Finally, I wanted to take my entire University class to a Sufi dhikr or visit a tarikah since as a group of university liberals they had never been. They may have personal theologies based on Ibn Arabi or Mulla Sadra, but no actual pietistic practice or exposure. But my hectic lecturing schedule outside of the university precluded the visit. Next time.<br /> </p>



<p><strong>Islamic Colleges </strong></p>



<p>Besides teaching graduate school at the university, I traveled to speak about Judaism in several Islamic colleges around the country. The goal was to give them familiarity with Judaism. </p>

<p>Many Indonesian attend religious colleges- Christian,
Hindu or Islamic- funded by the state and subject to state supervision. They
are generally BA institutions; students go to the secular universities for
graduate school. The Islamic colleges teach Islam in a college social-science
style. They have a mandatory freshman course in Islamic religion and culture.
The rest of the courses are part of the various majors. A history major can
take history of Islam, a sociology major can take a course on Islamic
sociology, an education major can take courses on Islamic education. Even a
college that has a major in Islamic law, offers courses of a historic-social
nature such as “Rise of the Salafi in the Modern Era.” The overall approach to
their Islam is to rely on the Indonesian tolerant culturally embedded form and
to study in a historic manner.</p>



<p>In some ways, one can compare their Islam to ideas of
a tolerant &#8220;Catholic Israel&#8221; historic form of Judaism with deep
respect for folkways and using their own clear thinking about the classic texts
over the stringent interpretations made in later centuries. The heads of these
Islamic colleges ideally have graduate degrees from places like the center of
religious studies at the secular Gadjah Mada University where I taught. These
deans, and department heads have the responsibility for the formation of a
tolerant Islam in their institutions.</p>



<p>In each Islamic college, I began my talk by
introducing myself and my religious background as a Jewish American, a rabbi,
and a professor. And in each place, I created opening connection by recounting
how the medieval Fatimid traders who originally brought Islam to Indonesia
included Jews among the traders. We have responsa from the Cairo Genizah
permitting wives back home in Egypt to remarry after Indonesian shipwrecks.
Indonesians understood these as analogous to the similar fatwa permitting
remarriage for the Muslim traders. But they also understood that Jews were on
the Fatimid trading ships as part of what Marshall Hodgson called the Islamic
Caliphate; the Jews were part of the diversity of Islamic Egypt in many ways
similar to my culturally belonging to the US.</p>



<p>The first part of the talk was an introduction to
Judaism as similar in structure to Islam in unity of God, prayer, and the other
pillars of Islam. I also showed similarity in dietary practices, circumcision,
and other rituals. Then, I repeated those ideas in a historic manner mentioning
Talmud, hadith, kalam, Maimonides, shaariah, fatwas, responsa and Jewish sufis.</p>



<p>Then, I gave a brief overview of Jews under medieval
Islam, both symbiosis and tension. I included famous contrasts such as the high
that Shmuel Hanagid reached and then the pogrom against his son. I continued
the history briefly survey the decline of the Jewish-Muslim relationship under
colonialism and the rise of nationalism. I transitioned to contemporary
interfaith efforts of Muslim organizations as well as very briefly mentioning
the basic terms of 21st century interfaith and intercommunal relations.</p>



<p>Finally, I concluded with the story of one of my
current Muslim Seton Hall students. He came to the program wanting to know
about interfaith and Christianity, and through the course of his study decided
that he wants to become a professor of Judaism in a Muslim country. He is
currently working on a PhD on medieval Jewish texts. I concluded with his story
as an exhortation for them to encounter Jews and study Judaism.</p>



<p>The students ostensibly know English as part of their
HS and college education, but in all the school I used a translator stopping
after every idea. In the first school, the translator only helped with some
words and summarized a few ideas. By the last school, I sat with the translator
the night before and went over the entire talk.</p>



<p>The content of the talk was not original. It included
the texts from the two chapters on Islam from my book Judaism and World
Religions, articles and handouts from Rabbi Prof Reuven Firestone, and speeches
from Rabbi David Rosen. For the first talk, not knowing what the students would
be interested in discussing in the questions and answers, I brought lots of
pages with me. A whole stack. For the next talk, I just brought the script of
the talk.</p>



<p>The reaction was better than anyone expected. I was
told to anticipate 30-50 students showing up in each school. Instead I had
attendance numbers like 200 in Manado and 160 in Kediri. They were excited
beforehand and afterwards to meet a Jewish scholar. There was sincere
appreciation for opening new vistas. After one of the times that I spoke, a
female student came up to me saying: “You give really good dawah,” using the
Arabic phrase for outreach or calling to God. </p>



<p>They had never heard any of this material before. They
did not really know the basics of Judaism, the history of Jews under Islam, or
met a Jew. In some ways, and I don’t say this to flatter myself, it was like
Swami Vivekananda speaking at the Parliament of World Religions (1893) to introduce
Hinduism, when his audience knew nothing about Hinduism, or at best, just knew
it as paganism. I do not know the stereotypes that they had before the lecture
since there was no before the lecture survey and Jews are not a big topic for
discussion.</p>



<p>I was repeatedly warned to prepare for abrasive
questions from the students about Palestine/Israel. In each case I was told to
brace myself. But these questions never came. Maybe they were just polite.
Maybe I seemed more of a cleric than a politician, the same way one would not
ask a Swami from the Vedanta society about Indian national politics. I assume
that I was perceived as more religious knowledge so no political questions. Or
maybe they themselves do not associate their Islamic practice in anyway with the
politics of Arabia, Pakistan and Syria, or even their own governments actions
to suppress rebellions. Alternately
as one Christian pastor involved in seminary education told me “Israel is a
Christian country”&nbsp;and he did not understand the existence of post-Jesus
Jews.</p>



<p>Instead, I was asked by the students in each school
about the normal concerns of contemporary college students. The questions of
the students were: Judaism and LGBT, Judaism and feminism or woman’s rights, is
internet good for religion, and what is the role of the internet in fostering
peace or violence. They did ask about overcoming social media hatred about
Middle East conflicts. They also asked about Jewish dietary laws and the exact
times of Jewish prayer. They wanted PowerPoint images of Jewish ritual objects,
tallit, tfillin, head coverings, synagogues, Jews from different lands. I
regret not having prepared such a display.</p>



<p>They had little interest in the theological questions of Moses vs Mohamed, or the nature of Jewish scripture, or even Quranic passages. They already have a basic respect and tolerance for other faiths as part of their curriculum.</p>

<p><br /> Since the Indonesian constitution states that &#8220;the nation is based upon belief in one supreme God.&#8221; The first tenet of the country&#8217;s national ideology, Pancasila, declares a required belief in one God, revelation and scripture, which is fulfilled by accepting Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Confucianism. There would be an automatic sense that we all worship one God and one sticks to one’s tradition. This basic equivalence of faiths as political theology allows them to easily add Judaism to their accepted religions. They have all studied this in high school as part of civics or civil religion.</p>



<p>The Islamic colleges seek to go beyond the mandated
course and offer a required course in world religions as part of their goal of
creating a tolerant Islam. They actively dismiss the hardline exclusive
readings of Islam produced in other countries. So, my audiences knew something
about Judaism from the chapters in introductions to world religions books of
Huston Smith and Ninian Smart. Those 1960’s classics present Judaism as
essentialized, without medieval history, and as a religion outside politics.
They have the other world faiths discussed in Ninian Smart in Indonesia, so I
was the novelty of meeting a believer in faith they never met before.</p>



<p>There are few books in Indonesian exclusively on
Judaism, some of the few books available are <em>Abba Eban, My People </em>and a
work by a Dutch Christian. This Fall 2019, one of the Islamic colleges will be
introducing a new course focusing on Judaism. I have a copy of the textbook
that the teacher produced; it builds on the categories of Ninian Smart. I also
met students who are studying Hebrew and came to the event in t-shirts embossed
with Shalom in Hebrew.</p>



<p>After each talk, I would be surrounded by dozens of
students wanting to take a selfie with me. Indonesia is a very big Instagram
country. There are hundreds of pictures on Instagram of me with young female in
a jilbab (Indonesian name for hijab) students. The jilbabs are an interested
facet of Indonesian Islamic life. They were generally not worn in the 1980’s
and returned in the 21st century as part of the self-identity of the younger
generation. The head covering by the young generation absolutely drives crazy
many of the baby boomer age Muslims who feel their children are getting too
religious. Yet, this young generation is more educated, open, and tolerant. </p>



<p>There is a vast literature on how the young feel the
jilbab is essential to their Islam and how at the same time they are more
likely than the previous generation to write dissertations on eco-feminism or
greater feminist rights. Part of the current acceptance of the jilbab is that
they are now in bright colors, vivid patterns and serve as bold fashion
accessories. More than half of my graduate classroom was female. From what I
hear, that is a major change from 15 years ago. </p>



<p>On the other hand, most of these same women wanted to shake my hand and then put their arm around me for the selfie. I asked many of them: Is touching a member of the opposite sex permitted. I have been in other Muslim counties where it clearly was not permitted, even in non-Salafi ones. Each woman gave the same basic answer. “We are not Salafi” so we touch. Salafi functions as a pejorative in the language of the college students for those too strict in the law or those who invoke a fatwa made in the Arab lands. They have their own identity as traditional Indonesian Muslims.</p>

<p><strong>What about Salafi Islam? Isn’t it taking
over?</strong></p>



<p>Some of my readers may remember that Bali was bombed in
2002 by Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamist group. &nbsp;But the government has been banning,
imprisoning, and expelling radical Islamic forces. Those convicted in relation
to the bombings were sentenced to death. </p>



<p>On the other hand, the NYT considers the younger generation
of feminists and phd students who wear a jilbob as a right-wing turn. However,
it is a truism around the world that the younger generation of Orthodox of any
faith who are more educated than their parents have a greater return to textual
practice as part a transition from traditionalism to a text-based religion. And
Indonesia has had religious parties that have wanted more Islam in the country since
it founding 1945, but they want an Indonesia Islam. </p>



<p>Recently, there was a wonderful article by Muhammad
Sani Umar &amp;&nbsp; Mark Woodward, “The
Izala effect: unintended consequences of Salafi radicalism in Indonesia and
Nigeria” in Contemporary Islam. In the article they “argue that the Salafi
religious and cultural agendas are incompatible with Islam as understood by a
vast majority of Muslims in these regions.” They see the extreme Islam as inauthentic
compared to their version. The Salafi seek to ban the cultural Sufi world of
poetry, music, performance and that drives the Indonesian to totally reject the
Salafi. &nbsp;The Salafi want to introduce
Arabic culture and people are proud of their Indonesian culture, so the Salafi
are obviously false. They show that Indonesians associate all forms of Salafi-
Wahhabism with violence and terrorism.</p>



<p>To return the opening discussion of how does
Indonesian Islam accept Hinduism and Confucianism as a unified monotheistic God
of tawhid. Indonesians study the Sufi mystics Ibn Arabi and Mulla Sadra who are
monists and &nbsp;define tawhid as the “unity
of being” (waḥdat al-wujūd) that denies an ontological distinction between
Allah and creation because all of it pre-existed in the mind of Allah prior to
the moment of creation. All of creation is a manifestation of the divine; we experience
the divine in all things. Since &nbsp;Salafis reject these propositions, then from
an Indonesian perspective they do not have the proper Islamic worldview.&nbsp; </p>



<p>My students certainly had these mystical perspectives
and their parents certainly went to Sufi shrines. Hence, they are compelled to
reject Salafis. Arabic beards and robes do not make the Muslim, rather the
unity of God in the heart. </p>



<p>Plato, in the Republic wrote &#8220;when modes of music
change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them.&#8221; Here
the converse is true. The Indonesian commitment to Gamelan music and ritual
performances &nbsp;means the extremism is not
accepted. I am not an ethnomusicologist and did not pay the same attention to
music as to religion. However, gamelan music is taught to children. People told
me that their relatives taught it to them as children or they went to Sunday
school for gamelan music. &nbsp;One Sunday morning,
standing before an open-side building design, I watched such a class for 30
kids. I even met some American ex-pats who were sending their girl &#8211; age six to
the Sunday gamelan class. People shows off to me that they could play. But
outside of the classes or special festivals and events, I heard little of it on
any island. Even the masjid in Kediri had a set up for playing gamelan music in
the mosque. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, yes, 2019 Indonesia is stricter than
1999 Indonesia. Alcohol and porn are banned on Java as an act of upholding Islamic
values- but that does not mean they want other aspects of the law or the
undoing of religious diversity. </p>



<p>Do not confuse Java with Aech on the northern tip of
Sumatra, which follows Sharia. I did not visit it and it functions, in many
ways, as its own region. I also was not in Papua or the Maluku islands. </p>



<p>In addition, do not confuse Islamic popularism in
politics with Islam as a religion. Indonesia has its share of Islamic versions
of Naftali Bennett, Ayelet Shaked, and Bezalel Smotrich, below the threshold
but making lots of noise. But they are not Bnai Brak Haredim, so too the
Islamic popularists are not Haredim. </p>



<p>For example, there is preacher at as a masjid on/near
the campus of University Gadjah Mada who advocates an ethno-national Islam of
wanting to exclude Christians and Hindus from teaching and living together, but
it has little connection to Islamic observance or knowledge of Islam. The same
ethno-nationals may not pray Islamic prayers or follow Islamic law. It mainly attracts
the formerly secular and those in the natural sciences. The strictly observant Muslims
are products of Islamic boarding schools and are more politically tolerant than
these ethno-nationals. The University’s administration counters the
ethno-national Islam by giving greater voice to the graduates of the Islamic
boarding school system who can read Arabic and know the Islamic religion. </p>



<p>Finally, seventeen years ago in 2002, was the last
time the university had a visiting professor of Judaism, Rebecca T. Alpert of
Temple U. In her own account of her time in Indonesia, she remarked how people
thought she was crazy to go to a Muslim country. Now, it is common to meet fellow
ex-pat Jews in Dubai, in Turkey, and elsewhere. Also she notes how she learned
of how the Biblical stories are portrayed in the Quran in this visit. Now there
are Jewish professors of Islam and Christianity as well as Muslim and Christian
professors of Judaism. The age of globalization creates a field of greater
travel for interfaith work, and in the 21<sup>st</sup> century there is greater
Jewish-Islamic encounter and knowledge of one another. My trip did not have the surprise element
but is all part of today’s interfaith work. <br />
