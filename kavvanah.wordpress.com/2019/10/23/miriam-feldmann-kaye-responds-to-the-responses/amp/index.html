<p>Welcome back after the holidays. Before the holidays, we discussed the new book by Miriam Feldmann Kaye and had three responses from Levi Morrow, Zohar Atkins, and Claire R. Sufrin. </p>



<p>  The interview with <a href="../../../../09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/index.html">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye- here, </a>the first response was by <a href="../../../../09/19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/index.html">Levi Morrow- here</a>, the second was by<a href="../../../../09/23/zohar-atkins-responds-to-miriam-feldmann-kaye/index.html"> Zohar Atkins- here</a> and the third was by <a href="../../../../09/25/claire-e-sufrin-responds-to-miriam-feldman-kaye/index.html">Claire R. Sufrin-here.</a>In her final word to response, Feldmann Kaye seeks to disaffirm and negate their specific comments.</p>



<p>At the end of her response, Feldmann Kaye positively affirms that we are called again to respond to the “plentiful array of intersections beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. Profound responses to these deeply philosophical questions, are well on their way, and many more rest on the horizon.” Personally, I look forward to these imminent profound responses. </p>

<p>Thank
you to Prof. Brill for hosting some of the critical questions of our times.
This blog pioneers contemporary Jewish thought, encouraging new Jewish
philosophical and literary knowledge and engagement. The nature of this
particular conversation reflects a heated discussion of the array of
intersections beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. These responses
partially epitomise the ambivalence towards the term ‘postmodernism’. Although,
expressions of this stance deserve to be addressed with a deeper,
content-based, and respectful nature, of critique.  </p>



<p>What
is apparent in this discussion typifies religious approaches towards
cutting-edge theology. In a positive sense, it also exemplifies engagement with
these ideas. The particular focus here is on my book, and an analysis of the
theologies of Rav Shagar (Rabbi Shimon Gershon Rosenberg) and Professor Tamar
Ross, but it is about a far broader picture of engagement with postmodern
thinking, drawing on the wealth of writings of other Jewish thinkers. It is
about the ability of Jewish thinking to cope with, or amalgamate, ideas from
contemporary philosophy.</p>



<p>Before
I address each response, there are two points which I stated in the interview,
that I will emphasise to avoid some of the apparent confusion:</p>



<ol><li>It is not my purpose to champion or to defend postmodernism.  This seems to be an important point to state, and to set aside some confusion. This allows us, or should have allowed us, to go beyond the debate of who is for and against; who agrees and who disagrees; who affiliates and who does not. The book addresses the ways in which, and the extents to which, ideas in postmodern discourse, are integrated into new thinking on contemporary Jewish philosophy. This includes discussions of the limitations of postmodern discourse in propounding a robust Jewish theology for today’s age.</li><li>I continue to take care not to class any of the numerous thinkers I deal with, as proponents of ’postmodernism’’. Throughout the book, I analyse Prof Ross’ and Rav Shagar’s <em>ambivalence</em> towards issues that postmodernism raises. This is not a simple zero sum game and needs to be addressed in accordance to these fine distinctions. </li></ol><p>Connected
or unconnected to this, the first two presented responses potentially discard a
great opportunity for a public conversation on the deeper issues at stake. </p>



<p>The
first response, written by Levi Morrow, would have had many of his issues
answered in the previous interview, which it seems was only partially related
to, as illustrated in the following ways: </p>



<p>Morrow
critiques what is plainly a philosophical analysis of Rav Shagar, stating that
“there is something fundamentally strange about trying to identify Rav Shagar
with a given philosophical stream”. </p>



<p>However,
this is precisely the way in which Jewish philosophy has functioned and
flourished for centuries: Philo and his integration of Platonic and Socratic
philosophy; Rambam’s engagement with Aristotle; Maimon and Mendelssohn’s engagement
with Enlightenment ideas; Rosenzweig, Buber and Levinas’ engagement with
phenomenology and existentialism.</p>



<p>The
consideration of future Jewish thought becomes the natural task – and the
consideration of Rav Shagar and Prof Ross as amongst these thinkers, brings to
the fore the issues of today – including Hasidut, neo-pragmatism, Kabbalah,
phenomenology, semiotics and late twentieth-century hermeneutical trends. This
is hardly ‘’strange’’. </p>



<p>What
is strange is that he states
that my book, which deals with philosophical elements of Rav Shagar’s
philosophy presents a “depiction of Rav Shagar [which] cannot serve to introduce new
readers to his theology’’.
It in fact <em>does</em>
provide readers with philosophical insights into the thought of Rav Shagar.
This simplification seems to be based on a mistaken understanding of the book
as an introduction to Rav Shagar’s life. </p>



<p>Rav
Shagar is indeed recognised for his total commitment to and deep engagement
with the national-religious Yeshiva world, from Kerem B’Yavneh, Mekor Haim, to
Bet Morasha, to Siach as his intellectual ‘’home’’. His writing is steeped in
Torah learning, and, as his works are published, presents an ever-developing
search for the mystical interpretations of religious-Zionism of Rav Kook. </p>



<p>At
the same time, Rav Shagar was also a Jewish theologian, and I invite others to
recognize him as such. His home bookshelf attests to his readings of
Wittgenstein, Althusser and others, alongside R. Shneur Zalman of Lyady. In his
later years, he was comparing the thought of Rebbe Nahman of Bratzlav with
Derrida, Barthes and Lyotard. And so, I re-state that Rav Shagar was a
theologian addressing postmodern thought at the same time as his immersion in
the Yeshiva world – the same way in which philosophers over the course of
Jewish history have also been.  </p>



<p>This
encounter between both worlds is an important part of this discourse in its
entirety. In this case, I analyse Rav Shagar’s Lamdanut through the lens of
phenomenology. Another example is that his interpretations of Hasidut, are
analysed within the framework of the philosophy of language. </p>



<p>Neither
Morrow, nor Atkins give hardly a mention to Prof. Ross, who is critical to the
discussion, at the very least in the way that Rav Shagar’s thinking is framed.
Readers might have expected at least one informed comment of Prof. Ross as
unique in her synthesised works on Rambam, and Rav Kook which simultaneously
address the meaning of religious language, and its epistemological
significance. Neither of the first two respondents take this crucial
comparative element into account – which ultimately suggests a misunderstanding
of the thematic nature of the book.   </p>



<p>Unfortunately,
Morrow’s response descends into nit-picking. He finds certain footnotes – of
which there are hundreds in the book – to be ‘’unhelpful’’ and another as
‘’frustrating’’ and another as ‘’insane’’. In addition to this sort of
language, he writes about the book as “misleading’’, and certain paragraphs
which are apparently ‘’lacking’’, and ‘’absent’’. </p>



<p>His
list of referencing publication dates is weakened by his statement that my
dissertation was, over a period of time, ‘’converted by the publisher’’. Is he
unaware, or taking away from the fact that I wrote the book? The content and
style of this critique could be understood as begging the question as to what
is really bothering him about the book.  </p>



<p>However, he completes his response by lauding my ‘’visionary theology’’. He writes that this work is ‘’excellent’’ and ‘’constructive’’ which is ‘’deeply in tune with both Jewish mysticism and the power of religious language’’. He also recommends that book ‘’call[s] for us to do much the same’’. Given his erudite readings and initial work of the translations of Rav Shagar’s work, one might have expected him to offer a more respectful response. </p>



<p>The
second response was written by Atkins. In his comments he seems to be missing
elements of the subject that were explicated in the book, and the interview, which
I’ve re-stated above. </p>



<p>Atkins’
response begins with what seems to be a description of postmodernism which he
implies forms the main argument of both my interview and book.  He then begins to critique postmodernism, and it
becomes apparent, that he is offering a metaphor for an engagement with
postmodernism, namely my own, with this sceptical critique. He blurs the
boundaries between his criticism of postmodernism and between my writing, wherein
it is implicit that the two are inseparable. </p>



<p>Atkins
considers my use of philosophers – including Derrida, Lacan, Irigaray – as superficial
‘’name-dropping’’ and ‘’miming authority’’ – comparing it to the listing of
names of women objectified in a degrading gangster sexualised rap song. This
inappropriate comparison raises the question as to what he is really
suggesting? Is the problem that philosophers are listed together as
representative of philosophical movements? Or is he offering a critique of postmodern
literature? Or is he critiquing the ongoing misogyny in popular culture, and beyond?
This would have been an interesting, albeit, misplaced debate had it not been
for the derogatory tone – which continues far beyond this paragraph. His
response was then unsurprisingly censored by Prof Brill himself.  </p>



<p>In
a continued reading of his piece, he repeatedly implies that I am out to ‘’defend’’
postmodernism. One example of this is his critique of Derrida for whom, he
writes, “performance is the point, that there is nothing besides the rhetoric”.
Again, it is probably based on the presumption that the book is putting forward
an unapologetic defence of postmodernism. </p>



<p>He
further states that I am the ‘’expositor’’ of Prof. Ross and Rav Shagar. This
is mistaken, in the same way that a scholar of Rambam is not necessarily a
logician, and a researcher of Kierkegaard is not necessarily a Christian
existentialist. In addition to this, unexplained responses to a multifaceted
discipline are rife: “a tease’’ – with no explanation as to what this means
here; “none of the views espoused by Feldmann Kaye…”; and, ‘’none reflect a
deep phenomenological experience’’. These are simplifications of a far more
complex discourse. </p>



<p>His
call for a methodological deconstruction of postmodernism itself is engaging. I
might too have taken interest in his discussion on Heidegger and Derrida, had
he not made repeated
generalisations of my interview, making the starting point of the discussion
difficult to ascertain.</p>



<p>However, with all
of this, he is “grateful to Miriam Feldmann Kaye for introducing the question of
postmodernism into the contemporary discussion of Jewish thought and theology”.</p>



<p>In the meantime, since publication, both respondents have sent me private apologies.</p>



<p>The
third response was written by Claire R. Sufrin. It was, relatively, a more
thoughtful and engaging response – not just because it came across in a respectful
manner but because she offers important reflections. I note that she hadn’t
read my book though she does have the decency to say so.</p>



<p>In response to
Sufrin’s point on Prof. Ross as a forerunner in the religious feminist
movement, please see the introduction to my book where I determine her
ground-breaking work on feminism to be a case in point of her broader concerns
in philosophy of epistemology and revelation. </p>



<p>The
question of how new the subject, can first be answered of postmodernism as a
movement itself. In its various formations, it can be said to go back to the mid-twentieth
century, alongside, or offshoots of, and manifestations of, contemporaneous
trends. This is because postmodernism constitutes a discursive model of engagement,
way beyond  philosophy and religion.</p>



<p>Postmodern
discourse is now appropriated in the fields of law, architecture, literature
and Political studies (even within Israel). 
These fields engage with the questions of how far postmodern discourse
serves to reframe the very questions asked in these fields of study. Some of
the central perspectives offered by postmodernism comprise issues such as
non-binary and beyond binary theories of post-structuralism, post-colonialism,
aesthetics, gender theory as well as meta-ethics. In the realm of religion,
‘postmodern theology’ has been developed by Christian theologians for the last
two decades.  </p>



<p>In
the introduction to my book, I suggest that the subject be approached
thematically, rather than by addressing totalised chronological movements of
‘’modernism’’ and ‘’postmodernism’’. What can be said though, is that we are at
the transition between modern and postmodern thought, reflecting the changes in
the trends with which we are surrounded. </p>



<p>I
am however intrigued by Sufrin’s question as to why the book is referred to as
new. I can think of at least ten thinkers, some based in Israel and some based
outside of Israel, who deal with aspects of postmodernism, who include Kepnes,
Handelman, Wolfson, Govrin and Ofrat. In addition to these thinkers, we also
now witness postmodern Jewish exegetical approaches to other aspects of
scholarship, such as of rabbinic literature, feminism, and so on. </p>



<p>As
a whole, we witness a glimpse into different approaches towards postmodern
ideas. We are called again to respond to the issues to hand, and to join the
substantive, heated discussion, about how Jewish thinkers respond to the
critical issues of our times – and to the plentiful array of intersections
beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. Profound responses to these
deeply philosophical questions, are well on their way, and many more rest on
the horizon. </p>
