<p>What books influence the theism of 20<sup>th</sup> century United States? Obviously, William James on religious experience, Rudolph Otto on the tremendum, Martin Buber on I-Thou, and Paul Tillich on ultimate concern. These are the works that color the theological language of modern theism beyond and before any specific allegiance a person may have to their Judaism or Christianity. Alternately, the sociologist Christian Smith, describes the American God with the phrase moralistic therapeutic deism. Even if one has affirms a specific denominational position, the average person regardless of religion would reflect the general theological language.</p>



<p>What would have been those works in the 13<sup>th</sup> century Judeo-Islamic world? It would probably have included Ibn Sina, Al-Ghazali and some Sufism. A good window into 13<sup>th</sup> century theological language are the writings of the<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-kammuna/"> Jewish author Sa&#8217;d ibn Mansur Ibn Kammuna </a>(d. 1284), who provides an exemplar of  “Abrahamic Philosophic Piety, a theological pious theism that transcends the specific of Islam,  Judaism, or Christianity.</p>

<p>Last year, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biu.academia.edu/TzviLangermann" target="_blank">Prof. Y.</a><a href="https://biu.academia.edu/TzviLangermann" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biu.academia.edu/TzviLangermann" target="_blank">Tzvi Langermann,</a> translated Ibn Kammuna’s book entitled &nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300203691/subtle-insights-concerning-knowledge-and-practice" target="_blank"><em>Subtle Insights Concerning Knowledge and Practice</em> </a>(Yale University Press, 2019). Professor Langermann is a hidden gem of a scholar. He earned his doctorate in history of science at Harvard and teaches in the Department of Arabic, Bar Ilan University. He is expert in medieval Judeo-Arabic science able to explain the astronomy, astrology, physics, math, medicine, Sufism, and philosophic piety in the medieval classics. I sat in on one of his courses many decades ago when he focused on Andalusian astrological works. (He would not remember me). &nbsp;The class helped me though my teaching career in my ability to explain the cultural world of Ibn Ezra, Yehudah Halevi, and Bar Hiyya. The recently deceased Maimonides scholar Prof Joel L. Kraemer (d. 2018) wrote that he always learned something new by speaking to Tzvi Langermann.</p>



<p>In recent decades, Langermann has turned East, working in texts from Yemen, Ottoman Empire, and the Mongol empire. Besides Ibn Kammuna, he translated and edited <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Yemenite-Midrash-Philosophical-Commentaries-Literature/dp/0300165315" target="_blank">Yemenite Midrash: Philosophical Commentaries on the Torah: An Anthology of Writings from the Golden Age of Judaism in the Yemen</a>, </em>a medieval philosophic midrash.</p>



<p>Below in the interview, Prof Langermann describes his study with the great Yemenite rabbinic scholar Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ (also spelled as Kafach or Kapach, d. 2000). Rabbi Kafah taught how to study Talmud without the Ashkenazi influence of Rashi and with an understanding of Torah dependent on the philosophic religion of Saadiah and Maimonides. Through this interview, I also learned that recordings of some of Rabbi Kafach’s classes are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In other projects, recently Langermann published a new responsa ascribed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.academia.edu/42248524/%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%94%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%A5" target="_blank">Maimonides on selling of Chametz on Passover (Shut says Rabbanu Hagadol but probably the Rif)</a>. Langermann is skeptical of the recent trend of finding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.academia.edu/37958789/Al-Ghaz%C4%81l%C4%ABs_Purported_Influence_on_Maimonides_A_Dissenting_Voice_from_Trending_Scholarship" target="_blank">Al-Ghazali’s influence on Maimonides.</a> I recommend watching his 13 minute lecture on Islamicized Yoga in Yemen Jewish thought.

<p>To return to our topic, Ibn Kammuna, a Baghdadi Jew, wrote an analysis of the three major monotheistic faiths based on excellent knowledge of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. This work, Ibn Kammuna&#8217;s <em>Examination of the Three Faiths: A Thirteenth-Century Essay in the Comparative Study of Religion </em>was translated by Moshe Perlmann (1971) offers a window in how comparative religion would have been approached in the 13<sup>th</sup> century Ibn Kammuna quotes copiously from Hadith and Islamic traditions. Naturally, Judaism wins as the best of the three. As noted by others, the book feels like a modern book in its candor and appeal to common sense logic &amp; religious experience.</p>



<p>The new work, Ibn Kammuna’s <em>Subtle Insights Concerning Knowledge and Practice</em> (Yale University Press, 2019).is a gold mine of ethics, ritual, piety, and religious thought of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. It is the sort of work that someone like me finds valuable quotes about the medieval Jewish experience and its culture.</p>



<p>Written for the newly appointed Islamic governor of Isfahan, this compact treatise and philosophical guidebook includes a wide‑ranging and accessible set of essays on ethics, psychology, political philosophy, and the unity of God. Here too, Ibn Kammūna, accepts the commonality of all monotheisms, both prophetic and philosophical.</p>



<p>In medieval society as presented in the book, society had two elements the common person who followed religion based on the authority of prophecy and the philosopher intellectual who has a philosophic religion. This book presents what &nbsp;Langermann calls “Abrahamic Philosophic Piety”, a world where everyone accepts the two principles God and prophecy. God is the same for all and is referred to as first cause, creator, and deity. Allah, Theos, and Hashem are automatically assumed to be the same universal God. Ibn Kammuna’s universalism is sympathetic to the idea of a pre-existent soul and possibly even gilgul (reincarnation).</p>



<p>The medieval classics of Abrahamic Philosophy Piety are not just an abstract Platonic-Aristotelean philosophy, rather a pietistic path to God. As noted above, if the late 20<sup>th</sup> century spoke an Existential language of seeking God in dialogue and as meaning in life, the 12-14<sup>th</sup> century sought God through an inner focus of God. This volume presents repentance- applying equally to all Abrahamic religions- as turning to focus on God, to settle the mind on God. Prayer is the intentional act of placing God on the heart. Gratitude toward God and offering thanks to God are important parts of piety. Ritual law is kept as self-restraint, but the focus is on God. The piety of the book shows ordinary Sufism without belonging to a sufi order (<em>tarikah</em>) or chanting God’s name (<em>dhikr).</em>Ibn Kammuna’s discussion has parallels in Bahye Ibn Pakudah’s <em>Duties of the Heart</em> and Maimonides in the <em>Guide.</em> &nbsp;The universal goal is the happiness of loving God as in Maimonides (<em>Yesodei Hatorah</em>, chapter 10) in his <em>Mishnah Torah.</em> And as Maimonides presents it, prophecy is an outgrowth of philosophic perfection(Yesodai Hatorah chapter 7).</p>



<p>Ibn Kammuna advocates kindness towards all creation and kindness toward animals, offering several choice lines about kindness toward creatures. In the book, Langermann speculates of possible Buddhist or Indian influence on this position, but in this interview, he is more cautious, viewing the kindness as an outgrowth of the Abrahamic Philosophy Piety. Usually, authors that I interview are cautious in their published writing and more speculative in unofficial interviews. In this case, it is the reverse. Langermann is more cautious in this interview but proffers in several places potential influence on Ibn Kammuna of Patanjali’s Yoga sutras (19) and in several places the possibility of Buddhist influence. (62, 148).</p>



<p>Ibn Kammuna is also important because he helped spread the thought of the Islamic thinker Suhrawardi (1151-1191) by writing a commentary on his work and integrating his though into this work. Suhrawardi taught a concept of illumination through luminous intuitions, divine sparks, and mental flashes into the pure heart. This experiential element is one of the factors giving Ibn Kammuna a modern religious flavor, looking a personal experience and mental flashes. (As a side point, David b. Joshua Maimonides (Egypt circa 1335-1410), last known nagîd belonging to the famous Maimonides’ dynasty wrote a Judaeo-Arabic work <em>Guide to Detachment</em> influenced by Suhrawardi).</p>



<p>Another vector of this book is the court of Mongol Khan where Indian and East Asian works were read and sometimes integrated. For example, the Khan’s vizier was Jewish born Rashid al-Din who wrote a survey of the culture religions of Asia for the Khan, showing his knowledge of the various 13<sup>th</sup> century schools of Buddhism.</p>



<p>Finally, Professor Langermann’s scholarship has brought to light the scholarship of Yeminite Jews, including pietistic and Sufi commentaries on Maimonides as well as the influence of Yoga ideas on medieval Yemenite Jews. &nbsp;Yoga texts could be integrated into Jewish thought the way Islamic philosophic texts could.</p>



<p>All these points, make his book a major contribution to the study of medieval Jewish religious culture. As soon as I read it, the book’s groundbreaking content struck me. &nbsp;The content of any given paragraph or page may not be new; it may just be citations from other works. However, the glimpse into the richness of ideas available to a Jewish reader at the time and the way they formed a theology of theism, akin to Tillich or James in our day is the innovation. Most surveys of medieval Jewish thought still follow Harry Wolfson’s trajectory from Saadiah to Cresacas without a glance at lands further East or towards the science, ethics and piety. This book could be assigned to help remedy the situation. Alas, the unfortunate problem with this volume and with much of Professor Langermann’s scholarship is that it takes a scholar to read them, they are treasures of philology. But they need to be brought to the educated philosophic Jewish reader.</p>



<p>One final note on the concept of “Abrahamic Philosophic Piety” as a philosophy of religion. I taught in Muslim Java in Indonesia this past summer, where the country accepts a form of this “Philosophic Piety.” All recognized religions had to affirm a monotheistic God, prophecy and scripture. Not just the three Abrahamic religions as in Ibn Kammuna’s books, but also Hindus, Buddhists, and Confucians also sincerely affirm monotheism, prophecy, and scripture. They all fit into a global theistic philosophic piety. &nbsp;Langermann’s edition of ibn Kammuna and my Indonesia experience leaves me wondering about the potential of a 21<sup>st</sup> century Jewish version of this universalism. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Interview with Prof Langermann</h2>



<p><strong>1)&nbsp; &nbsp;How are you a disciple of Rav Kafah?<br /><br /></strong>My late father purchased for me the set of Kafah’s translation of Maimonides’ commentary to the Mishnah; this was in the late seventies, when I was still in graduate school. I was very impressed and made it a point to try to make contact with the rabbi upon my aliyah in late 1979.</p>



<p>Eventually I found his synagogue and began to attend regularly his “shiurim”, or study sessions: Sunday evenings we read philosophy texts, mostly by Maimonides and Saadya, and Thursday evenings we studied Maimonides’ <em>Mishneh Torah</em> (<em>halakha</em>). I attended regularly for about twenty years, until the rabbi’s demise. I also learned a good deal of Talmud in his synagogue; for the first time I realized that one could make sense of the Talmud without Rashi! I also would ask from time to time to meet with him privately in his home study</p>



<p><strong>2)&nbsp; &nbsp;What is unique to Rav Kafah’s translation style of the Guide?</strong></p>



<p>Every translation of the Guide is unique in its own way. Rabbi Kafah stands out in that he came to the Guide as part of a still living tradition of studying it in the original, beginning with his grandfather’s classes when he was not yet bar mitzvah. He must have read the Guide from cover to cover dozens of times before he began to translate. There is a certain feeling for the language that cannot be learned; you have to grow up with the language as your mother tongue and the language of the place where you live. The only other translator who had such a native command for the language was Harizi, and that’s why Harizi’s translation is so important, despite its well-known issues. There are certain mistakes that a native speaker would never make.</p>



<p>Rabbi Kafah’s notes are also invaluable, especially the many references to Saadya. Though Saadya is never mentioned by name, he looms large behind the scene, but you have to be expert in Saadya to detect this. Most trained academics know how to find Saadya in discussions of divine attributes and such matters. However, the rabbi could detect where Maimonides is responding to Saadya’s translation of biblical verses, because he seemed to know Saadya’s translation by heart! Many times, as we studied texts, I heard Rabbi Kafah cite Saadya’s Arabic translation of a verse right off the cuff. By the way, a complete set of recordings of one of the cycles of his lessons on the Guide has been uploaded to archive.org.</p>



<p>3<strong>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to Ibn Kammuna what are the fundamentals of religion that all agree upon?</strong></p>



<p>From his book on the three faiths (Ibn Kammuna, Examination of the Three Faiths, trans. Moshe Perlmann, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1971)&nbsp; it is clear that the one thing all three so-called Abrahamic faiths agree upon is the truth of prophecy, which in fact has two components: that prophets receive divine revelations on all sorts of issues, and also that some select prophets reveal to us the code by which God commands us to abide. Therefore, he has a section on the general phenomena of prophecy which is separate from the individual chapters given to Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, including the book whose translation I have just published, he displays a list of tenets that are agreed upon by “the masters of traditional religions” and those who are masters of “intellectual tenets” agree upon. These are the existence of the deity, the end of days, and doing good works.</p>



<p>Clearly the ideas are the same, it is their source that differs: “religious” people receive them from prophets, whereas “intellectuals” (that is, those whose tenets ultimately derive from reason alone) arrive at them by some type of discursive reasoning. Medieval philosophers, in one way or another, considered the acquisition of essential truths to be not just a laudable action, but the telos of human existence. There were debates or worries about the limits of human knowledge, but, even though there are things that we cannot possibly know, this does not detract in the least from our obligation to pursue knowledge.</p>



<p>It is not hard to see how the religions could agree on the existence of some supreme being or the requirement to do the good. As for the end of days, there is some traditional support for this in revealed scripture, though to varying degrees: not that much in the Jewish scriptures (though perhaps more in rabbinic tradition) but strongly emphasized in Christianity and most especially in Islam.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Intellectuals” (as defined above) for their part&nbsp; would have held cosmological or astrological ideas that the universe as we know it will come to an end; it will exists for only a finite (if “astronomically” long) period, though it may regenerate in infinite cycles.</p>



<p>Religion is perforce traditional, since prophets come infrequently, and so the communities that form around the prophet must pass on the prophetic revelations from generation to generation.</p>



<p>In contrast, “intellectual” tenets can in theory be rediscovered and reconfirmed (or refuted) at any given time. To be honest, though, we should admit that tradition and authority play a decisive role in “intellectual” communities as well; contemporary academia being just one avatar of that phenomenon.</p>



<p>4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Why did Ibn Kammuna create an almost de-Judaised and de-Islamisied philosophy both here and in his other writings?</strong></p>



<p>That is a very complex question. First of all, he did not do this in all of his writings. His famous “Examination of the Three Faiths” has a distinctly pro-Jewish bias, which was not lost on Christian and Muslim readers. It is not overtly polemical; he does not attack any other religion—and believe me, the polemical writings such as those by Ibn Hazm and Shmuel ha-Maghrebi are quite toxic. However, Judaism does come out looking the best of the three in that book. Similarly, his relatively unknown treatise comparing Rabbinites and Karaites (an internal Jewish schism) clearly favors the Rabbinites.</p>



<p>Suhrawardīs Talwīḥāt is a book of basically Aristotelian philosophy with no “religious” identity and so is Ibn Kammuna’s commentary on that book.</p>



<p>“Subtle Insights” is a much more delicate work. In my reading—and maybe some will disagree—Ibn Kammuna has very cleverly included enough Islamic references so as to make the book appealing to his Muslim patron, but not so much as to cause a Jew, Christian, or even an unaffiliated intellectual to feel that the book is not addressed to him.</p>



<p>5)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Why are the different names he uses for the deity? </strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;He will use Allāh occasionally, but that is very commonly used in Jewish writings, even in Sa‘adya Gaon’s translation of the Torah into Arabic. I am sure you know that today, it is Muslims—specifically, more recently, some intolerant people in Malaysia—who objected to the use by Christians of the name Allāh.</p>



<p>He also uses the very common <em>wājib al-wujūd</em>, or “necessary existent”, and other appellations that are found in philosophical texts; after all, “Subtle Insights” is a book of philosophy. He occasionally employs <em>al-ilāh</em>, which is etymologically the closest in Arabic to the Hebrew <em>Elohim</em>. On the other hand, he is generally (though perhaps not always) careful to avoid cognomens that imply a Creator God. He will use terms like <em>mubdi’</em> which means something like “source”. I think that he wished to avoid taking any stand on the issue <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>, which not all philosophers were comfortable with.</p>



<p>Using more than one name for the deity is not unheard of. The Torah does it; “critical” scholars claim that different writers chose specific names, for whatever reason, but the traditional approach has always been that God has more than one name. After all, how can one name capture an infinite being? Even today, and in English, we say “Heaven” as in “Heaven forbid!” or “The One Above”, the “Creator”, and more.</p>



<p><strong>6)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is his view of a pre-existing soul and of the stability of the individual soul?</strong></p>



<p>Ibn Kammuna accepts the notion of the pre-existing soul; in doing so, he breaks with Avicenna, the foremost authority in his historical setting.</p>



<p>He also seems very much to accept the related doctrine of transmigration, since a soul that enters the body after having already lived a life in a different body is pre-existent. That doctrine—which many (unfortunately) now take to be a cardinal belief of Judaism—was frowned upon, let us say, and so Ibn Kammuna never quite commits to it openly.</p>



<p>He definitely held to the idea of a stable self, some “package” that identifies the individual and can even remain intact as it moves from one person (who has just passed away) to another (who has just been born). However, this cannot be simply the soul, since the soul is and must be susceptible to substantive change and improvement (or, heaven forbid, degeneration) as one lives one’s life. The soul and the self have different names in Arabic, but it is not clear to me—and may never have been fully worked out by Ibn Kammuna—just where and how they differ.<br /><br /><strong>7) How does he explain repentance? How does he explain worship?</strong></p>



<p>Repentance is the starting point of the voyage whose ultimate goal is the return to God. It’s a state of mind, a combination of the pain felt from past mistakes and the resolve to do better. To use a different analogy, it is the decision to leave the path that takes one away from God and to take the path that takes one to Him. This resolve is considered today, I think, to be the sine qua non for the possibility of teshuvah, whereas teshuvah itself consists in strict observance of the Law.</p>



<p>But for Ibn Kammuna, repentance consists in resetting the mind and consciousness, devaluing things of this world (i.e. material possessions and bodily pleasures) and giving value to what exists beyond the material world, i.e., the eternal abstract truths that allow a glimpse of the Truth. Hence even people who are punctilious about the Law need to repent if their minds are focused on this world. (Maimonides is very much of this opinion too.)</p>



<p>Worship consists in “devotion and presence of the heart”; the heart should always be primed to do what is good. He endorses prayer, even supererogatory prayer. Prayer is a combination of intention and recitation, with primacy given to the former. He also speaks favorable of certain bodily postures which, however, are useful in funneling “lights” directly to the heart. Good intentions can take precedence over worship; sleeping with the intention of restoring one’s strength to do the good is better, he says, than praying in a state of fatigue.</p>



<p><strong>8) What is the role of the law and ritual duties for Ibn Kammuna</strong></p>



<p>I think that he, like Maimonides, considered the chief purpose of the Law to be setting our personal and social lives in order. On the personal level, this means basically restraining our appetites by setting limitations on food, sex, and other matters. He seems to be in line with those (both Jews and Muslims) who felt that the details—for example, what specific foods you eliminate from your diet—are not essential; there is nothing intrinsically better for a Jew or Muslim to abstain from pork than it is for a Pythagorean to abstain from beans. I am not sure that he would have felt that any religious commandments are pure “ritual”, whatever that means.</p>



<p>I have no idea how observant Ibn Kammuna may have been with, say, sabbath observance or tefilin; I would suspect that he saw value in maintaining the tradition, but I have no idea how all this played out in real life. I would like to make one more point that I think is important: Ibn Kammuna, like Maimonides before and Rashid al-Din al-Hamadhani afterwards, were all Jews who served potentates in some capacity; and they all paid the high social and political price for being Jewish, even if (again I don’t know) in their outwards demeanor—how they dressed, what they ate or didn’t eat—they were no different from Muslims (or Christians, Zoroastrians and others) with whom they associated. Everyone knew that they were Jewish or, in the case of Rashid al-Din after his conversion, formerly Jews.</p>



<p><strong>9)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is his unique approach of compassion to animal ethics? Does it show Buddhist influence?<br /><br /></strong>He says that the divine command to be compassionate towards all things extends to animals insofar as we are enjoined to exploit them in the lightest manner possible and to slaughter them only for nutrition or our safety (presumably he is excluding the hunt for the pleasure of hunting which was so popular among the nobility of his day).</p>



<p>However, he takes a fairly extreme position—again, seen against the backdrop of the thought of his time—in hinting, though not quite declaring, that animals possess an immaterial soul, and not just the soul that was thought to be part of the body; I means the soul that basically manages and regulates the body.</p>



<p>Buddhist ideas of compassion towards animals certainly made inroads into the Ilkhanid realm, and one cannot rule out the possibility that Ibn Kammuna took something from them. However, I have found traces of discussions of the ideas about the souls of animals&nbsp; in Avicenna and his disciples, and that would certainly be more likely to be a source for Ibn Kammuna—if we need to identify a source. Ibn Kammuna invested the greater part of his intellectual energies in studying the soul, and some of his ideas about animals may come out of his original research and speculation.</p>



<p><strong>10)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the influence of Suharwardi, Sufis, and Ismaeli thought on Ibn Kammuna?</strong></p>



<p>Ibn Kammuna commented on Suhrawardī’s Talwīḥāt. In fact, his was the first and one of the most penetrating commentaries on that book, and played a significant role in bringing Suhrawardī to the attention of the medieval scholarly public.</p>



<p>In a paper published about twenty years ago, I suggested that Ibn Kammuna discovered Suhrawardī’s writings during his stay in Aleppo, to which city, along with many others, he fled from the Mongols. The Talwīḥ<a>ā</a>t is rather tame compared to some of Suhrawardī’s other writings, but it still gives some indication of the direction that he was taking. Ibn Kammuna clearly read some of Suhrawardī’s Sufi writings, from which he quotes. For example, his definition of the thanks that we must offer God looks to come directly from Suhrwardi. The same holds for his paragraph on the love for God as the happiness or felicity that comes with envisioning the presence of the beloved deity.</p>



<p>Now to the Sufi’s. I have a lot to say. Though I have hardly published on Sufism, I’ve taught a number of courses. The first thing is this: the type of Sufism I encountered in “Subtle Insights” is by and large what one may call fairly standard piety, turning away from this world and devoting oneself to God. He does assign a great deal of value to knowledge of God, but this is no less a part of the philosophical tradition than it is of Sufism. The many similarities between Sufism and so-called philosophical mysticism are not given enough attention.</p>



<p>Not a few scholars rail against “binary” approaches, then forget their own preaching when they get down to the business of writing. It is not just a question of “terminology”. The type of experience that one may arrive at—that one hopes to arrive at—at the culmination of the philosophical quest is, viewed as a phenomenon, not different from the one that which mystics claimed as their own.</p>



<p>That ultimate experience is by definition indescribable, so how can you say that the “stupefaction” of the philosophers is different from that of “mystics”? In what way can you say that is, if neither is describable? (Maimonides would say that the trance of the mystics is a self-induced delusion, vertigo rather than a true religious experience, but let’s not get in that.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the book Ibn Kammuna compares the special powers attained by some Sufis with those possessed by the prophets. But don’t forget, many philosophers thought that prophecy would follow automatically when someone attained “perfection” in philosophy. Trying to untangle the threads of Sufism and philosophy in thinkers like Ibn Kammuna is unwise, in my opinion. Suhrwardi was equally at home in both, because they both aimed at the same goals; ditto for Ibn Sina, and even, to some extent, al-Ghazali, as we now know. And don’t forget Plotinus!</p>



<p>Getting back to Ibn Kammuna: he does speak of maqāmāt, the way-stations used by Sufis to check their progress. There is no denying that this is a word used by Sufis, who have a whole system of identifying and describing the different stages; some of this is in the book that I recently translated. Still, there is no denying that philosophers such as Maimonides warned initiates to take stock constantly of their progress, and not to try to reach beyond their capacity at any given moment.</p>



<p>My point is that whatever Ibn Kammuna takes from Sufism—and it is a lot—is well integrated into his Weltanschauung, which we may call Abrahamic philosophical piety—if we have to give it a name.</p>



<p>Though Ibn Kammuna clearly quotes from Suhrawardī, he could have gotten the same ideas from any number of sources (as Suhrawardī surely drew on earlier sources). None of the elaborate ideas of Ibn Arabi and his school are to be found in Ibn Kammuna, as far as I know. Moreover, I find nothing in Ibn Kammuna to indicate that he owes any special debt (or debt at all) to the “Jewish Sufis” who preceded him: Bahya, the descendants of Maimonides, or even Yehudah ha-Levi, whose Kuzari is a major source for the “Examination of the Three Faiths”. One last point: the type of piety urged by this sort of Sufism is very similar, in places indistinguishable, from the philosophical ethics of people like Miskawayh or Maimonides for that matter, with roots in Hellenistic thought. Ibn Kammuna has nothing to do with Sufi ceremonies such as the dhikr.</p>



<p>Finally, you asked about the Isma‘ili’s? That would be about as politically incorrect as you can get under the Mongols. The Mongols captured the Isma‘ili fortress at Alamut in 1256 and did not go about it gently. Moreover, Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, who was an associate of Ibn Kammuna and a very powerful figure at the Mongol court, was at one time an Isma‘ili, one might even say a “verbrennter”&nbsp; Isma‘ili, but wisely de-Isma‘ilized his religious philosophy after the fall of Alamut.</p>



<p><strong>11)&nbsp; Was there anything unique about philosophy and theology under Ilkhanid rule? Can you make any statements about the role of Hindu, Buddhist, and Asian ideas on Jewish thought in this context?<br /><br /></strong>The only thing I would mention is the compilation of encyclopedic works—encyclopedic in the sense of covering many fields of knowledge though not necessarily in depth. Ibn Kammuna’s “New Wisdom” is one example. It could possibly be the case that people feared that the Mongols would destroy the written heritage of centuries; after all, they did destroy most of the great library at Alamut, and a lot more. I think that some intellectuals felt that they better summarize—but also develop—the knowledge that had been painstakingly amassed over centuries in the hope that some of it would survive. But this is pure speculation on my part.</p>



<p>As for Asian ideas and the Jews—well we should speak of Rashid al-Din al-Hamadani, born Jewish in 1247, though he converted to Islam by he age of thirty. He was vizier to the Khan, had very ample resources, and made a monumental effort to make Chinese medicine available in Persian; one book on this topic survives, <em>Tansuqnamah</em>. However, he seems to be pretty much unknown to Jewish thinkers. Ibn Kammuna did not have that much of an impact on Jewish thought, but there are manuscripts of some of his writings in Hebrew letters (though in the Arabic language); but Rashid al-Din is unknown to Jewish readers.</p>



<p>12)&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>How did Yemenite Jews have an Islamic version of a Yoga text?</strong><br /><br />Yemen was <em>the</em> major entrepôt on the very busy trade route between Egypt and India, so there was constant contact. However, the yoga text that was read by Yemeni Jews has a very complicated history, not yet completely unraveled. It was called in the Yemen <em>Mirʾāt al-Maʿānī</em>, “The Mirror of Ideas”, or perhaps “The Mirror of Meanings”. The text has been studied by Carl Ernst, who also promises an edition; for now, see some of the chapters in his <em>Refractions of Islam in India</em>. The Arabic text is compiled from an otherwise lost Sanskrit text on yoga, a Gnostic text (“The Acts of Thomas”), and a text by the same Suhrwardī that we spoke about earlier. It was copied into Hebrew letters, and I have identified some fragments in various collections.</p>



<p>It was cited, for example, for its discussion of the twelve-chambered heart in one of the philosophical midrashim that came out of the Yemen. Some of the extant fragments describe yoga postures, including one for levitation or flying. One Yemeni writer thought to connect this with the midrashic phrase, “<em>qaftsa ha-arets</em>”, literally “the land jumped”, used to describe the case where a long journey takes a very short time, or what seems like a very short time.</p>



<p><strong>13)&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you describe the Yemenite commentaries on the Guide? Are they published and available? Do they show Islamic Influence?</strong></p>



<p>There are two major commentaries, one by Hoter ben Shelomo, perhaps the most prolific writer on philosophy produced by medieval Yemeni Jewry, and a long anonymous commentary, which I am in the process of editing and translating (simultaneously) into English and Hebrew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(There is also a very rich, dense set of marginalia to the Guide written by a Muslim; that is a whole other story). All three commnetaries date to the fifteenth century, roughly, as does most of the extant science and philosophy produced by the Jews of Yemen.</p>



<p>I do not think that&nbsp; commentaries by Jewish writers are all “Islamic” in some sense, even if the source is a book written by a Muslim. For example, one of the commentaries has a very long gloss on <em>Guide</em> II, 40, which begins by quoting Aristotle (not named) that man is a social being. The political philosophy that the glossator endorses, which is also that of Maimonides, is based on the idea that without a strict law code, we would eat each other alive. This is the view attributed to the Shi‘a by Jāḥiẓ; but it is not proper to call it Islamic, since it has roots in antiquity and continues through Hobbes and beyond.</p>



<p>However, the same commentator describes the prophet as <em>khalīfat Allāh fī arḍihi</em>, “God’s deputy on His earth”. That is a Qur’anic phrase; the commentator does not note this, and he may have been unaware of its origin. Some Qur’anic phrases were thought to be philosophical or sapiential maxims. I published this gloss in a Hebrew article a few years ago; an English version will be included in a book that I am due to submit by the end of 2020, called <em>In and Around Maimonides</em>.</p>



<p>Influence is one of the most overused, and misused, terms in the publications on Jewish thought that I have seen. The philosophically inclined Jews of Yemen read books written by Muslims, books with a decidedly Islamic tinge if not substantial Islamic content; they found these works interesting and useful for articulating their own outlooks, which are avowedly and self-consciously Jewish. If the truth of this sentence suffices in your view to pronounce Islamic influence, then such influence cannot be denied. I am of the opinion that there is much, much more to the word “influence”, both as an historical-cultural process which must be characterized as precisely as one can, and as an expression of the political and social climate within which we—the scholars working now on these subjects—live and work. I am not much of a theorist, so I try to contribute I can by example, that is, by putting into practice my understanding of what influence is and what it is not, etc. etc., in my own work. I should stop here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below is a translation of an essay by Rabbi Menachem Froman z”l of Tekoa done by Levi Morrow. <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2016/08/17/rabbi-menachem-froman-my-followers-will-laugh-from-this/">We have a long prior post on this blog discussing Rav Froman’s ideas and a translation of some of his aphorisms here.</a> The essay below discusses how we can remove the social mask we wear by an act of self-acceptance, showing a noted similarity to the thought of Rav Shagar.</p>



<h3>Translator’s Introduction-Levi Morrow</h3>



<p>Rav <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Froman">Menachem Froman</a> (d. 2013) was a Religious Zionist <em>rosh yeshivah</em>, grassroots political activists, and all-around cultural figure. The narrative arc of his life moves from growing up secular and studied for a degree in Jewish philosophy at Hebrew University (though students inform me he never took the final exams that would have enabled him to graduate) to becoming religious and studying at <em>Merkaz Harav</em>. He <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HasidimTsohakimMiZeh/photos/a.2349700938389268/2507799512579409/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCHRjlprvu1M9ELPH9Qq5csmgx0D8VLGeSyRJENgNE_De2UXcpA7Z43GXh5G9inIAtL9XDeUWzMueRM9OVQU2fMIPo6KuTcmWY05ySb_FUFNYo21mxaL0nF3A8HC7TAm89-mafUrS8O4vZrv6fD86yEYwh2ofXkFdlV1znoa2cryoaNZDKd3WjpmttS5LWMDweb2va2vzCuV_GQyp8xcyemVDvhOoD3_3IQJTT2PN7oB5ryYeIvz2ja2jqetmmLfZlbZQT42AOF8fSczu0fj8gvokFkMppvIuX6-UH1vYwtBDCCXQzS-8NiWxHH9I5Qdz093tuU5xRsc_qSEKctFCeMEYYV&amp;__tn__=-R">became Rav Tsvi Yehuda Kook’s personal attendant</a>. He would later become a <a href="https://thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/the-anti-spiritual-rabbi-a-students-perspective/">teacher</a> and <em>rosh yeshivah</em> in his own right, as well as a driving figure in the grassroots movement for peace between Israel and Palestine.</p>



<p>He also had a &nbsp;deep and enduring <a href="https://www.facebook.com/levidmorrow/posts/10161567542020161">interest in all forms of creativity</a>–art, poetry, literature, <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/rabbi-menachem-froman-on-the-theater/">theater</a>, etc. Among his posthumously published <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2016/08/17/rabbi-menachem-froman-my-followers-will-laugh-from-this/">writings</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HasidimTsohakimMiZeh/">teachings</a>, is a book of poetry entitled <a href="https://mashiv.org.il/product/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%98-%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%A3/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%92%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F/"><em>Accounting for Madness</em></a> (HEB). His poetic, creative sensibilities, however, cannot be confined to his poetry. In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HasidimTsohakimMiZeh/photos/a.2349700938389268/2395245567168138/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBhn0hUX--b5Nb6FpbtgyhpyFyCHG7S-KU8nKpN-eOgfDle6NfxZlLdO__wm8yqvwXkLPYhVCr5Pr-O5FHt3y3FgtdqOC9JrToNWx9-ujD26JJgm3QdqMHQ5CgOJvZePneTjPQvqTPs4OTNo5NiX4FnAEp22iC97Qm_Xh8E_R8aCcC1DBUes0xCm16feGrxRnxI1ZubORFG9X_CjrJuA1xsUCQ8M1xI0WzuQsK1KsyX_BREKbnUnUvKV6DCpaAHLFMLBlkIWmNJ-cswZL6JgrTVVM2pnpX6qLPaK9U1_PnBEDTad7I2jELCkj6yL_eJMAUJpQbLhclMpdkocTDgI2Q-O_iq&amp;__tn__=-R">one of his Torah teachings</a>, he poetically equates religiosity with depth and suggests that depth–such as found in the writings of Franz Kafka and Amos Oz–is somehow divine.</p>



<p>This blending of the religious and the poetic may never be more clear than in the Torah teaching translated below, which meditates on the image of a face–and what it means to have a face. The face is the very nature of Torah itself. In this short piece honoring the anniversary of Moshe’s death, the 7<sup>th</sup> of Adar, Rav Menachem Froman explores the issue of identity through the metaphor of the face.</p>



<p>According to Rav Froman, our face is something we are essentially stuck with, yet it also plays a pivotal role in how other people identify us, and perhaps even in how we identify ourselves. As such, the face serves as a fitting symbol for the more inflexible aspects of ourselves, such as our families and cultural upbringings. Some people spend their entire lives trying to escape who they are, only to realize they’ve run directly into being themselves. We put on masks, trying on new identities, typically only to discover that the change is not even skin deep. Is real change–changing our face rather than simply putting on a mask–even possible?</p>



<p>Moses, <em>Moshe Rabbeinu</em>, drawn from the water, son to both Egyptian princess and Israelite slave woman, is a man of many faces and identities: prince of Egypt, hard-fisted seeker of justice, leader of thankless complainers, and prophet-legislator of God’s people. In many ways, the lion’s share of the Torah is dedicated to descriptions of Moses as he slips between these roles, or perhaps grows into each one in turn.</p>



<p>So how did Moshe relate to himself, to the constraints of his inflexible face? Rav Froman proposes two possibilities: First, perhaps Moshe simply ignored his face, refused to let it determine the course of his life. Given enough determination, we can create ourselves, choosing who we want to be rather than simply accepting ourselves as given. Second, perhaps Moshe recognized the force his identity exerted upon his life, and consciously accepted it. He “saw his own face from within rather than from without,” meaning that he was simultaneously able to appreciate his identity from a distance and still experience it as his identity–a paradoxical blend of freedom and attachment that Rav Froman suggests may not “make any sense to say.” Choosing to embrace a given situation can change it from a prison to a home, from dim fate into luminous destiny. This, Rav Froman suggests, may even be the deepest element of the Moshe’s teachings.</p>



<p>These two approaches correspond to two important ideas in the thought of Rav Froman’s long-time friend and colleague, <a href="https://thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/god-torah-self-accepting-the-yoke-of-heaven-in-the-writings-of-rav-shagar/">Rav Shagar: self-creation and self-acceptance</a>. Rav Shagar grapples constantly with the nature of the self and personal identity, oscillating between–or attempting to synthesize–the two poles of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Jean-Paul Sartre. Sometimes Shagar wants us to recognize that we have a pre-existing identity and choose it freely, and sometimes he wants us to boldly choose to create ourselves, to shape ourselves into who we want to be without any thought to who we already are. So too in this piece from Rav Froman.</p>



<p>This text reflects Rav Froman’s sophisticated literary sensibilities. Most of it is an extended, playful discussion of what it means to have a face. On the more technical side, the text is also full to brimming with specifically chosen language, whether face-related metaphors, references to traditional Jewish texts, or instances that combine the two. I (Levi Morrow) have done my best to convey all of these linguistic elements into English to the best of my ability, but there was never a chance of perfect success.

<h3>A Chosen Face- Rav Menachem Froman</h3>



<p>We have known Moses since Egypt. We have known him face to face. Sculptors and artists of generations made use–like spies–of their greatest and freest creativity, making wild and far-ranging guesses. Ultimately, it is clear to anyone who looks that these artists depicted Moses in their own image–his face is their face (not that this devalues their art in any way). In contrast, we know exactly what he looked like. We don’t feel any need to try and depict him. What would be the result? That he had a big nose? A high forehead? Anything we could say wouldn’t actually clarify anything. And what does it matter anyway? Suffice it to say that he had a face just like each of us.</p>



<p>And just like each of us, Moses certainly suffered from his face from time to time. Who would tell such a bold-faced lie as to deny that they sometimes wish they could change their appearance? Having to wear the same face day after day, moment after moment–is exhausting. Some people face this duty with great enthusiasm–they smile broadly, full-lipped. Some consistently and intentionally take the two-faced path. These are the bold-faced revolutionaries who would see their own faces (and those of others) thrown back in either wild laughter or heart-wrenching tears. The heart can perhaps even be torn, but not the face. Acts of despair like these don’t change the way things look. In the best case scenario, these attempts result in a few more wrinkles. Only the light cloud resting over the frustrated face alludes to the heroism-turned-embarrassment.</p>



<p>Many put their trust in time. But with every journey, and with every stop, the hardships of the wilderness increasingly scorch our faces. Moreover, the years bring old age–as they always do, which is why we cannot uplift the face of the noble, nor give splendor to the face of the wretched (Leviticus 19:15; Job 34:19)–and begin to mark us with its signs. So you imagine that, at this heavy cost, perhaps you have at least had some success in that external realm that is as intimate as possible–more trenches in your forehead, more cuts around your disappointed mouth. You have a conversation with your contemporary about the ways you’ve managed to escape your fate, when your son comes up and your friend lets slip the unkindest cut of all: “Wow, he’s so similar to you! Like one face reflecting another in water! (Proverbs 27:19)!”</p>



<p>We have no choice but to lower our eyes and admit, ashamed, that we live in this terrible state of constant denial and avoidance (<em>hester panim</em>). Someone with a big nose will have it his whole life, no matter how wide his nostrils flare with anger. He can’t reduce his suffering by even a millimeter unless he avails himself of the surgeon’s scalpel.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s always the most radical path–you could wear a mask. The immediate result would no doubt be striking, but its protection wouldn’t last forever. It will immediately become clear that this winning ticket–which fell into your hand as if from heaven–comes with a heavy price. A mask, by definition, is something external, not internal. The problem I describe affects us all too deeply for some superficial fix. You can’t escape the claustrophobic constraints of your face behind the even harsher constraints of the mask, just like you can’t escape thick chains by fleeing into a dungeon. Someone persuaded to follow this path will ultimately tear off–in a fit of terror–the veil that surrounds him. This dangerous path necessarily brings confusion, and you will spend far too much time trying to remove your own face. When you finally realize your mistake, your face will blacken like the bottom of a pot.</p>



<p>These hardships–which are the fate of every person–affected our teacher Moses as well. Even after he went up to Mount Sinai twice and neither ate nor drank for days on end, and even after the rest of his miracles, Moses kept guiding us with the same bright eyes and kind face we always knew. However, certain events suggest to the unbiased mind that something here is different–the cord that connects all men has here been cut. We cannot forget that right after his encounters with the creator, when he brought us God’s holy words, we saw his face as simultaneously terrible and wondrous. It was as if the very skin of his face shone and became like a speculum that shines. In a manner defying all understanding, anyone who looked at Moses then could see that he had no idea that something special was happening to him; he was acting as though his face remained the same as always. My proof: Moses did not understand our fear and continued to address us and summon us before him.</p>



<p>The careful scoffers dismiss these contradictions by saying, “It was Moses! We can’t know anything about him!” But his faithful devotees claim that Moses merited that for which every man on the face of this earth hopes, and escaped his unfortunate constraints (<em>metsarim</em>). They add that he merited this because–in contrast to all of us–he never felt pinned down by the contours of his face.</p>



<p>Expert readers of the biblical verses explain that Moses hid his face <em>from his face</em>, meaning that he saw his own face from within rather than from without, if that makes any sense to say. This lack of self-awareness–which is both simpler and more complex–is why the Torah says that he was the humblest of all (Numbers 12:3), that no one had arisen like him who knew God face to face (Deuteronomy 34:10). The fact that he continues to appear as he had previously, they explain, was an act not unlike putting on a mask. Moses stepped free of the fate of his face, but he took it up again out of free will. Perhaps we should call this what it is: A chosen face. Some say this is the innermost aspect of the Torah of Moses.</p>

<p> This is our 19th post on Rav Shagar, &nbsp;for #18 which was also on Hanukkah see&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/rav-shagar-and-secular-studies-on-translation-and-living-in-multiple-worlds/">here, Other  entry points are </a><a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/02/28/rav-shagar-on-adar-infinite-jest-english-translation/">here</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/03/08/on-the-joke-of-the-megillah-by-rav-shagar/">here.</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2016/10/26/judaism-and-post-modernity-rabbi-shagar-in-english-translation/">here</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2016/12/06/rav-shagar-on-hanukah-in-english-translation/">here,&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/rabbi-shagar-values-and-faith-in-the-postmodern-age/">here.</a>)  The texts are first drafts from a collection of essays of Rav Shagar to be published by Levi Morrow and myself. </p>



<p>The first option of comparing the Hanukah candles to the Temple menorah and thereby the sacrificial service, Rav Shagar uniquely portrays sacrifice as destruction, destroying the object offered, and the need to be completely consumed. In this approach, Shagar, follows George Bataille’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Religion-Georges-Bataille/dp/0942299094">Theory of Religion</a> in which we overcome the modern self by a return to sacrifice and destruction. &nbsp;For Bataille, who died in 1962, religion is the search for a lost intimacy with animality and the cosmos. The ritual attempts to recovery the intimate original order through the violence of the sacrifice. Only by sacrifice can we destroys the functional utility of the object to return us to lost state of immanent being.</p>



<p>Making use of passages from Bataille&#8217;s theory allows Rav Shagar to portray Hanukkah candles as pure destruction which grants us liberation from thingness; it allows us to ascend to “nothingness and envelops itself.” </p>



<p>Mizvot such as Hanukah bring us back to a primordial religious experience which “destroys or nullifies any existence other than the existence of the creator, and denies any possibility of understanding the creator and encountering him.” Paragraphs such as this should serve a warning to comparing Shagar’s use of philosophy and post-modernism as Torah uMadda and even more of a warning against asking how Rav Shagar helps your suburban Orthodoxy. This is a nullification of self and the material world. </p>



<p>Rav Shagar see exemplars in figures such as Rav Nachman who were willing to sacrifice their very beings as an non-utilitatian offering of the self to seek God. They never expected to understand or grasp God, all we can do is offer up our very existences. </p>



<p>Rav Shagar relishes the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century Chabad conceptions &nbsp;of completely nullifying the self (bitual hayesh) and thereby completely nullifying the world into a state of nothingness. We negate the pleasures of this world and seek a complete liberation from all things to “return to a pantheistic state of simplicity and oneness with existence.” Rav Shagar express similar hope to be the moth to flame in his book on martyrdom and self-sacrifice. So please stop thinking of him (or having bad Facebook discussions of him) as an intellectual pulpit rabbi who reads postmodernism. For him, we commit our whole beings toward death to have a possibility of a divine encounter.</p>



<p>The second approach to Hanukkah candles treats them as “energy, movement, and light” illuminating our lives. “Lighting the candle does not express self-sacrifice but the powerful Eros of life.” The candles ignite our souls into passion, an Eros of existence rising from the darkness of the ever-present Thanos. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This Erotic illumination “leads to nostalgia” and sense of how light out of darkness leaves us lonely when we sense its fleetingness, and how much the candle is a mere “illusion of eternity” because we return to darkness. &nbsp;Even when we have moments of illumination, Rav Shagar feels how quickly it will fade. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rav Shagar sees this distinction of sacrifice and illumination as the numinous and the pleasurable. The numinous as in Rudolf Otto’s classic book <em>The Idea of Holy</em> and the pleasurable as Freud’s pleasure principle. Rav Shagar will devote 3 lines to associating Otto’s numinous to Levinas and Derrida  who have concepts of “the other” and “the difference.” The pleasurable is shown in the meat and rich foods of the Sabbath. The richness of pleasure is for Rav Shagar, an essential of Judaism. He gives a nice vignette about how he tells his students who eat dairy of Shabbat in order not to be exhausted that Judaism is about pleasure.</p>



<p>From this distinction, Rav Shagar glides into the importance of the familial shabbat table with its pleasure and inviting of guests as opposed to the doorway of hanukkah. Holiness is a good meal overflowing with “good and grace for the participants.” As Rav Nachman of Breslav says hosting guests is like hosting the shabbat. The home is being with oneself and allowing the walls between self and other to break down. Rav Shagar has similar language of being at home or “at homeness” about the Yeshiva, the beit midrash, and one’s non-foundation acceptance of faith. One create a sense of at-homeness.</p>



<p>In contrast, we light Hanukkah candles on the liminal border between the home and the dark evil world, between self and sin. The guest of Hanukahh is a process of overcoming the self and comfort to embrace an otherness and thereby embrace the Other. We have no permission to use the light in a utilitarian way as things are normally used in the home. &nbsp;On Shabbat there is a solidarity and interpersonal closeness; On Hanukah, at the space of the from door, the outside world does not play by the rules of our hospitality and the guest retain freedom. (These Hanukah ideas are based on uncited Rav Nachman ideas of Hanukkah as wondrous and abnormal. &nbsp;<a href="https://bobmschwartz.com/2019/12/21/the-hanukkah-guest-a-story-from-rabbi-nachman-of-bratslav/">Rav Nachman has a story where a householder lights the Hanukkah candles</a> and the guest magically takes him flying into the sky to paradise as well as <a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/shipwreck/derridahospitality.pdf">uncited Derrida on hospitality.)</a></p>



<p>Rav Shagar concludes the homily with a prayer, or a hope, that opening the door can create connections never before possible and in addition we “will not require the exclusion of Otherness but will include it without crumbling. &nbsp;The idea of new connections never before possible was part of his homily on Greek wisdom and Torah for <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/rav-shagar-and-secular-studies-on-translation-and-living-in-multiple-worlds/">a different Hanukkah- posted here.</a> The discussion of no longer being exclusive of the Other is behind many of his expansive socio-political homilies.</p>



<p>The entire 3500-word homily is below and available as a download below. It is still a rough draft. It is from the book of essay that Levi Morrow and I are producing. Some of the sentences and paragraphs still need clarification. </p>

<h2><strong>The Candle and the Sacrifice</strong>: <strong>A Sermon for Shabbat Hanukkah</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Life and Death</strong></p>



<p>Nahmanides in his Torah commentary equates the Hanukkah candles with the candles of the <em>menorah</em> in the Temple.<sup> <a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></sup> Other commentators have a reverse approach that contrasts the <em>menorah</em>, which was lit only while the Temple stood, with the Hanukkah candles, which we light throughout the exile. Based on this distinction, I want to explore some of the different meanings of candle lighting and its holiness, the candle of the <em>menorah</em>, the Hanukkah candle, and the candle of the Sabbath.</p>



<p>While lighting the Hanukkah candles we say, “These candles, they are holy.” What is holy in a candle, the light or perhaps specifically the way the candle burns, consuming itself?</p>



<p>Lighting the candles of the <em>menorah</em> was one of the priestly services in the temple “Speak to Aaron saying: “In lighting the candles toward the face of the <em>menorah</em>, light seven candles” (Numbers 8:2). The nature of this service emerges with greater clarity when contrasted to bringing a sacrifice. The sacrifice returns the “thing,” the object-animal, to nothingness via its destruction and consumption, as clearly expressed by the <em>Olah</em> sacrifice that is burnt up entirely on the altar. “The priest shall offer up and turn <strong>the whole</strong> into smoke on the altar. It is an entire offering by fire, a pleasing aroma for God” (Leviticus 1:13). However, we need to be specific:</p>



<p>The principle of sacrifice is destruction, but though it sometimes goes so far as to destroy completely (as in a burnt offering), the destruction that sacrifice is intended to bring about is not annihilation. The thing–only the thing–is what sacrifice means to destroy in the victim.<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>



<p>In other words, the sacrificial act returns the objectness (the thing-object) to the intimacy of existence, to a state where everything merges in everything else, like “water in water.”<a href="#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The sacrifice is therefore not elimination and absence but “returning to nothingness.” A return from existence, from the world characterized by functional and instrumental distinctions that tear things from the deep intimacy of the divine world, to where there is no accounting.<a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>



<p>On the one hand, the death of the sacrifice is the concept of limitation. Death from the perspective of life ends the differentiation of the world of things. The idea of limitation grants a thing itself, its existence, because limitation is necessary for existence. On the other hand, death grants existence its unity with itself. Through the disintegration of distinguished things, existence becomes liberated from thingness, ascends to nothingness and envelopes itself.</p>



<p>From the perspective of the living thing, the sacrifice ends in defeat, as it leads to deadness and elimination. It is impossible to “destroy the animal as a thing without denying the animal&#8217;s objective reality&#8230; one cannot at the same time destroy the values that found reality and accept their limits.”<a href="#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Now that death manifests, the animal no longer exists from the perspective of life in “the world of things.” The sacrifice therefore turns into an existence of emptiness.</p>



<p>The absolution annihilation of the sacrifice expresses one of the primordial religious experiences: rejection and nullification of the value of the world. Religiosity inherently bears within it an experience of destruction, <a href="#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> in that “it destroys or nullifies any existence other than the existence of the creator, and denies any possibility of understanding the creator and encountering him.”<a href="#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Hasidic conceptions of nullifying existence, such as the Habad contemplation of “everything before God is as nothing,” ultimately take part in the nullification of the world.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>



<p>You can see the broad attention to the experience of destruction in Hasidic teachings in the descriptions of the yearning and consumption of the soul where they are compared to a sacrifice that burns the pleasures and enjoyments of this world. In Hasidut, the sacrifice represents “the elevation of feminine waters,”<a href="#_ftn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> a process of love at the center, a liberation from things and a return to a pantheistic state of simplicity and oneness with existence. Faith grows out of this state. Reality receives its spiritualization from death, which deconstructs the differences in existence, as found in specific aspects such as commitment to martyrdom upon going to sleep, or when falling by lowering one’s head in prayer.<a href="#_ftn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> These leads to liberation from the ordered laws of existence, yet [mizvot] are bound up in frustration and inner pain since our existence does experience death and the destruction of existence as liberation. That experience belongs to the intimate nothingness, what a person “sees only at the moment of his death.”<a href="#_ftn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>



<p>The sacrifice in the temple resonates with the requirement of martyrdom “with all your heart, with all your life, and with all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:5). “With all your life &#8211; even if he takes your life.”<a href="#_ftn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> “With all your might (<em>me’odekha</em>)” “In Rabbi Meir’s Torah scroll they found it written: “Behold it was very (<em>me’od</em>) good” (Genesis 1); behold death (<em>mot</em>) was good.”<a href="#_ftn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> A person must commit his whole world to death in order to open up to the divine absolute, as only in the consuming of life does there exist the possibility of encounter with the infinite.</p>



<p>In contrast to sacrifice, the character of lighting the <em>menorah</em> candles is different in that it leads to illumination and vitality. Certainly, the candle consumes itself, but this happens in the process of living, as a consuming that is itself part of living, as “the soul that I placed in you is called a candle.”<a href="#_ftn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The consuming is also present in the oil and the wick consume themselves as they burn. However, lighting aims not at eliminating but at burning, kindling, and illumination that give life. The inanimate oil and the wick transform into energy, movement and light. Just as a person consumes his stores of energy when integrating the spiritual and physical parts of himself in the process of living, so too in the lighting of the oil and the wick they unite and shine, receiving life. From this perspective, the lit candle reflects the process of life, the activity of the soul.Lighting the candle does not express self-sacrifice but the powerful Eros of life.<a href="#_ftn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>



<p>(The ancient custom mentioned already in the Mishnah (<em>Berakhot</em> 8:6) of lighting of a memorial candle is the act that best expresses the metaphor of the candle as the soul of man. With the lit candle, it is as if the person resurrects the departed in his memory, his soul shining in the candle. Due to its comparison with the soul, the candle becomes the medium for the embodiment of the departed’s soul.)</p>



<p>The role of the high priest in lighting the candles is therefore different from when he sacrifices the offering. With the <em>menorah</em>, his role is to illuminate souls, to ignite them, to give them the passion and the Eros of existence.With the sacrifice, his job is to bring a person to self-sacrifice and personal consumption; to give up on the finite nature of his existence by overcoming himself. This is a different manner of Eros, wherein “strong as death is love, hard as hell is jealousy, and its darts are darts of fire, a blazing flame” (Song of Songs 8:6).</p>



<p>The Eros that we find in contemplating the light of the candle is the same Eros of the soul of man, a consequence of this duality of light and consumption. This Eros leads to the nostalgia that we find in various Hanukkah songs. The lightness is the small and raw existence of the candle-soul, the dim candle that stands outside under threat of the great darkness. The loneliness, the quiet, and the monotony of the lit flame create the illusion of eternity, as if it will continue forever, that the candle and the soul will never go out. From this perspective, the Eros of the small candle is greater than that of the mighty, brazen, light of the torch.</p>



<p><strong>Two Holies</strong></p>



<p>As a general principle, bringing a sacrifice and lighting the candles present two different types of consciousness regarding the holy: the numinous and the pleasant. This echoes a split found in the Bible, where the holy sometimes appears as the awful and terrifying <em>mysterium tremendum</em>, which demands the destruction from sacrifice, and sometimes as the illuminating good, replete and pleasurable.<sup> <a href="#_ftn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></sup></p>



<p>The holy arouses fear and brings with it the destructive. In the language of Levinas and Derrida the holy represents the “other” and manifests the “gap” and “difference” that cannot be bridged. “Anyone who touches the mountain shall die. No hand shall touch him, but he shall be either stoned or shot; beast or man, he shall not live” (Exodus, 19:12-13); “They shall not enter to see the dismantling of the holy, lest they die” (Numbers 4:20). However, the holy also appears as good and pleasing, overflowing its bounds: “Go, eat rich foods and drink sweet drinks and send portions to whoever has nothing prepared, for the day is holy to our Lord. Do not be sad, for your rejoicing in the Lord is the source of your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10). The holy day is sanctified when it is called “delight,’ the lord’s day, ‘honored” (Isaiah 58:13), and seeking the favor of God through eating rich foods and drinking sweet drinks: “Then you can seek the favor of the Lord. I will set you astride the heights of the earth, and let you enjoy the heritage of your father Jacob; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken” (Ibid. 14). The symbol of pleasure is oil – “You anoint my head with oil; my drink is abundant. Only goodness and steadfast love shall pursue me all the days of my life” (Psalms 23:5-6). Oil bears an erotic connotation in the Hebrew Bible: “Your ointments yield a sweet fragrance, Your name is like finest oil— Therefore do maidens love you” (Song of Songs 1:3), and it is holy “Make of this a sacred anointing oil, a compound of ingredients expertly blended, to serve as sacred anointing oil” (Exodus 30:25).</p>



<p>This facet of holiness is manifest on the Sabbath – when we light the Sabbath candles – in the Sabbath foods, which are generally rich, as the poet wrote: “to delight in pleasures / swan, quail, and fish;”<a href="#_ftn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> in the Sabbath sleep, which is pleasure; and in the command of marital intimacy for scholars, especially on the Sabbath.<a href="#_ftn18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> All of these flow into the candle – the oil and the wick.</p>



<p>(It seems to me that the difference we find in the Hebrew Bible between the holy as the numinous other and the holy as harmony and pleasure is root of the debate that I sometimes have with some of my students about the Friday night meal. They are accustomed to eat a dairy meal in order to avoid eating rich and exhausting foods. Against them, I claim that this damages the holiness and pleasure of the Sabbath. In response, they say that each person’s pleasure is different, which is correct. Despite this, I answer them that the fact that they prefer dairy to meat, the light over the fatty, is a lack in their Judaism.)</p>



<p>The Sabbath candle is like the light of the home, gentle and pure, it does not impose a blinding otherness on a person, nor dread. It is also not part of the thunder and lightning of Mount Sinai, where anyone who touched the mountain would die.<a href="#_ftn19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> The candle lights up its surroundings, the home. The holiness here is familial, the light belongs to the home and is meant for the home, like a good meal, overflowing with good and grace for the participants; the good and grace connect the participants one to another.</p>



<p>It is therefore not surprising that the holiness of the Sabbath is inseparable from the hosting of guests, as Rebbe Nahman of Bratslav asserted “hosting guests is like hosting the Sabbath.”<a href="#_ftn20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> The pleasure of the Sabbath is manifest in the harmony of the body and the soul. The additional soul of the Sabbath, which Rabbi Solomon Yitzchaki explained it is “an additional soul that expands his consciousness for eating and drinking,”<a href="#_ftn21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> leads to reconciliation between contradictory elements, reconciliation that is parallel to life, which connects body and spirit, oil and wick. The Sabbath candle is a candle of harmony in the home: “What is ‘My soul is removed far off from peace’ (Lamentations 3:17)? Rabbi Abbahu said: That is kindling the Sabbath lights”<a href="#_ftn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> because the candle provides the satisfaction and fullness of the home. This is also the origin of hosting guests on the Sabbath – a person has a homey dimension, a “being with himself,” and it is with this that he hosts guests. This is reconciliation of contradictory elements on a social level; the walls between a person and “the other” fall down for the sake of unity, subjectivity (<em>nafshut</em>), and fellowship.</p>



<p>Can we identify these characteristics in the Hanukkah candle? This is a candle of “each man and his family,”<a href="#_ftn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> rooted in feeling at home. On the other hand, “we have no permission to use them, only to gaze at them,”<a href="#_ftn24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> since this light, the light of the candle, evokes the gap between it and the person who lights it. A person has no permission to use it, in that, he must keep his distance from it. Moreover, this candle is located “just outside the <strong>doorway</strong> of the house,”<a href="#_ftn25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and “sin crouches at the <strong>door</strong>” (Genesis 4:7). The candle does not only belong to the home and to the feeling of being at home, but also to an Other space, dark and outside the known, familiar, boundaries, the demonic space. This candle’s roots are in war, the war of the Maccabees, not in the harmony of the Sabbath. To sum up: the Hanukkah candle carries within it both facets: the sacrifice and the <em>menorah</em>; consumption of the soul and the Eros of life; the outside and the home, otherness and hosting guests.</p>



<p><strong>Hosting Guests</strong></p>



<p>Two different types of hosting guests follow this approach: that of the Sabbath, which is when a person opens the doors of his well-lit home, and that of Hanukkah, connected to the harsh aspects of the divine (<em>gevurot</em>), when a person transcends himself toward “the Other” who is outside the door, and brings him into his home as an Other.<a href="#_ftn26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac Halevi of Homil, a student of Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, describes it thusly in his Hanukkah sermons. The Sabbath is “specifically a person for himself, in his home, with his household who obey his will. In contrast, the behavior of Hanukkah, which is outside the home where there is authority besides him and his will is not sovereign. This is why you must behave differently there”<a href="#_ftn27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>



<p>Sabbath hosting guests is an outgrowth of a person “being with himself,” the solidarity of a person with himself and of his household with each other. The basis for hosting guests is the state suitable to reveal the familiar in a person and between people. He invites the “Other” into his home due to the fellowship and closeness that will exist, and perhaps already exists, between him and the household. He is invited to be a member of the household and to take part as a son in a home lit up by Sabbath candles and angels of peace. Ultimately, this mutual acceptance flows from the commonalities between people and it reveals what they share, the soul, which is a person’s good intentions, to which all sons and daughters of the home belong.</p>



<p>Hosting guests on Hanukkah is something else entirely because it requires self-sacrifice and inspires fear, rather than the harmony of the Sabbath. This hosting of guests requires a person to overcome himself and his “I”, as an absolute process, a decision, a revolution that he undergoes in relation to the Other, overcoming the otherness of the Other.<a href="#_ftn28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> It is a process of consuming through self-overcoming and putting faith in the Other despite his otherness. It is hosting guests without depriving the Other of his freedom, and therefore not expecting solidarity and interpersonal closeness but simply otherness – often deep chasmal otherness – between guest and host. This lets strangeness invade the home, and therefore this hosting of guests destroys the feeling of being at home as the reality of the home loses its everyday familiarity. The candles are lit and shining – seemingly warm and familiar – but we do not have permission to use them, only to gaze at them – they estrange themselves from the person lighting them.</p>



<p>Hosting guests on Hanukkah does not occur in the lit home, but just outside the front door. Just as the sacrifice is a liminal concept (<em>musag gevul</em>) between the existence of things and their nullification, so too the Hanukkah candles stand on the border between the home’s feeling of familiarity – which has its rules, definitions, and distinctions – and the lack of feeling at home that crouches at the door. Hanukkah hosting guests does not force the guest to accept the house rules, and therefore it requires the host to overcome himself and allow the guest his freedom to be, without knowing what effects this freedom will have and without restraining him by the light of the candles of the home.</p>



<p>The Hanukkah candle therefore presents multiple facets. As a candle, its center is the home, but as a sacrifice, it lacks homey familiarity. Minimally, the head of the household is perturbed. The Hanukkah candle is exilic, the candle of a broken house. Only such a candle enables the wondrous Hanukkah hosting guests and opens the door to the abnormal, which can create connections never before possible. Hanukkah illuminates within us the time when concepts like the home and feeling at home will not require the exclusion of Otherness but will include it without crumbling.<br /></p>

<p>With classes finished for the semester, I need to catch up on my reading. On my table are several recent books, all of them of the last four years, explaining the recent turn to interreligious studies. The current trend is to replace the word interfaith with interreligious since the term faith is a Protestant understanding of religion. And to place greater emphasis on the prefix “inter” to show that we are interconnected, with interreligious moments all around us. Diversity is continuous factor in our lives playing a role even in law, politics media, athletics, and education. Another part of this trend is to replace the survey of world religions class with a class on interreligious moments in our lives. Students learn more about Judaism by discussing why Satmar representatives went to an open casket memorial in a funeral home but won’t go to a church funeral than studying random snippets of Genesis and Leviticus compared to the Vedas and Koran. </p>



<p>A recent Jewish book to deal with this new interreligious moment is Prof Ephraim Meir’s <a href="http://idra.org.il/product/faith-in-the-plural/"><em>Faith in the Plural</em> (Idra Press, 2019),</a> which is brand new and surprisingly not on Amazon or even available as of now in the US<em>.</em> The book has a great cover by Utah artist <a href="https://www.artneedlepoint.com/artists/tornquist-suzanne">Suzanne Tornquist.</a> (The cover art is also available as a talit or tefillin bag).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ephraimmeir.com/">Prof. Ephraim Meir</a> is Professor emeritus of modern Jewish Philosophy at Bar-Ilan University. His PhD is from KU Leuven in theology and he taught for decades at Bar Ilan University. A prolific author his recent works are Levinas’s Jewish Thought between Jerusalem and Athens (2008), Identity Dialogically Constructed (2011), Differenz und Dialog (2011), Between Heschel and Buber (2012; with A. Even-Chen), Dialogical Thought and Identity (2013), Interreligious Theology. Its Value and Mooring in modern Jewish Philosophy (2015) Becoming Interreligious (2017) and Old-New Jewish Humanism (2018). From 2009 until 2017, he was the Levinas guest Professor for Jewish Dialogue Studies and Interreligious Theology at the Academy of World Religions, University of Hamburg. He is President of the International Rosenzweig Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prof Meir’s latest book <a href="http://idra.org.il/product/faith-in-the-plural/">Faith in the Plural (Idra Press, 2019)</a> along with his prior works <em>Interreligous Theology </em>(2015) and <em>Becoming Interreligious </em>(2017) are his views on this change. Meir affirms the social fact of religious pluralism and also a theological view of pluralism based on John Hick. To give my reaction upfront, I accept the former and not the later. In addition, I don’t think Meir himself needs to affirm the later based on his own theory of trans-difference and testimony.</p>



<p>In the 1960’s, interfaith events, the Jewish-Christian reconciliation, and Church’s renewed encounter with Asian religions changed the theological climate. Alan Race created theological categories Exclusivist, Inclusivist, and Pluralist for the spectrum of positions taken at the time. </p>



<p>By 1970, John Hick the world renown philosopher argued that we must undertake a Copernican Revolution and assume one ultimate Reality and all religions are just attempts to grasp the Ultimate. Hick was widely influential and respected. Yet, in recent decades he received much criticism for thinking his was the only correct opinion, for his lack of empiricism, and for actually precluding interfaith understanding since religions are only metaphors and symbols for the ultimate Reality. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, much of the field has turned to various acceptance models that differ with Hick. Mark Heim argues that religions do not offer the same goals. For example, Christian redemption has little to do with the Yogic conception of perfection. George Lindback argued that each religion is a closed system, with different non-comparable rules. And the most common method now is comparative theology, where I compare my faith to another and seek understanding but without making any major claims about the relationship between my faith and the world’s faiths. (I find myself within these 21st century approaches.)</p>



<p>Ephraim Meir’s book assumes John Hick’s position as his starting point to argue for a philosophy of dialogue. Not dialogue in the 1960’s sense of comparing theology, but a 21<sup>st</sup> century definition. We dialogue as an act of encounter and knowing the complexity of the world, we dialogue in a Levinas sense of the other religion breaking into our world and making demands, and we dialogue to produce social justice and reduce violence. For Meir, dialogue moves the pluralistic position forward. </p>



<p>Meir gives five characteristics or requirements for dialogical theology, and this is one of the strong parts of the book. His five are humility, translation, uniqueness, hospitality and learning. Here Meir is seemingly building on the interreligious approach and comparative theology of the last decade including those of Francis X. Clooney, Marianne Moyaert, Catherine Corneille and many others. Yet, they are not cited or referenced</p>



<p>Meir, however, specifically is steering clear of developing a theology. And he does not think he needs to address comparative theology. He maintains a clear focus on dialogue both inter-religious and intra-religious.</p>



<p>Meir’s major point is that we understand and relate to other religions through what he calls trans-difference. His dialogical approach is not a meeting or in-between like Buber’s rather we belong simultaneously to the broader world and to our own framework. We are part of the specific and the general. </p>



<p>Another one of his concepts is testimony. I reveal the divine by my own self contraction and listening to the other. This concept is an outgrowth of his reading of Rosenzweig, Heschel, and Levinas. &nbsp;His reading of the modern classics to produce his concept of trans-difference is how he deals with contemporary issues such as identity, authenticity, otherness, and understanding.</p>



<p>The book has several chapters on his deriving his views from the Jewish thinkers. The book also has a chapter comparing Jewish &amp; Christian views of freedom as well as an interview with Ephraim Meir on the relationship of Jews and Christians.</p>



<p>Finally, and as theoretical grounding for his project, Meir approaches Perry Schmidt-Leukel’s<a> </a>interreligious work as contained in his recent Gifford lectures as a valuable means of interpreting religious diversity.  John Hick created a pluralism in which only the Ultimate Reality is real and religious systems are not, thereby reducing the importance of the differences between religions. Perry Schmidt-Leukel approaches the issue in a new manner using the concept of fractals. Here each religion is a fractal of the Ultimate Reality, recapitulating its structure and at the same time each religion has a fractal relationship to other religions. Each religion is a part of the whole and almost everything reappears in some way in the different religions. Think of a cauliflower, if I break off a floret it has the same basic structure as the entire cauliflower, similarly each floret is similar to the next floret. Applied to religion, the religions are similar in structure therefore one religion can understand another. The pluralism respects the differences between religions as florets but sees a unit in the repeating pattern combined to make a larger pattern.</p>



<p>If you think one religion is a floret and another is an eggplant and a third is a carrot, then this fractal model would not work. Meir’s movement away from the fractal model is two -fold. First, there are many cases of impossibility of dialogue, of fundamental theological differences, and of lack of understanding. All aspects that can only be overcome though dialogue. Secondly, Meir wants to emphasize the ethical, social-relations, and seeking to mend the world more than any philosophic truth claim. Hence, Meir formulates his trans-difference as an ethical alternative to a truth-claim approach. </p>



<p>Which brings me back to my opening. If Meir is basically about social and ethical relationship then the other interfaith models could also work, including comparative theology. &nbsp;I really liked the book in its understanding of dialogue, especially his use of Jewish sources to derive the approach. The book has &nbsp;good Jewish ideas about religion as trust not intellectual assent. There are many gems in Meir’s valuable book, which can be picked out and used elsewhere. I was struck by the value of the book because I am in the middle of collecting my interfaith talks into a small volume and found his Jewish formulation of general interreligious ideas very helpful. I will definatley be using many of his ideas particularly in his reading of Jewish texts in future talks and papers.</p>



<p>I thank Meir for discussing my books for a few pages. He is one of the few who understood my Ricoeur influenced position in those books correctly.&nbsp; However, a Ricoeur position is able to maintain particularity without becoming pluralist while still being comfortable with translation, hybridity, hospitality, and the impact that an encounter with another religion has on a person or system.</p>



<p>The former Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks in the first edition of his <em>Dignity of Difference</em> presented a pluralism in which each religion has its own covenant, its own religious path and morals. God does not want a single unified path, rather we are broken into tribes and peoples. Rabbi Sacks quoted Nathanial ibn Fayumi’s idea that God sent a prophecy to each nation. Ephraim Meir writes that as a philosopher, he is less interested in concepts such as revelation and covenant and more interested in dialogue and pluralism. But most interested in these topics of inter-religious meaning either seek the theological, the wisdom of other faiths,  or the explicit social application.  But those who want a philosophic approach thinking with and around Levinas will enjoy the work.</p>



<h2>Interview with Prof. Ephraim Meir </h2>



<p><strong>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please explain the concept of Faith in the Plural.</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Faith in the Plural&#8221; has a double meaning. First, it is faith in <em>plurality</em>: a plurality of voices and lifestyles is celebrated. One does not just note the existence of the plurality but rejoice in it. Others are approached in a positive way and recognized as different and equal to each other : one may appreciate their unique particularity and learn from their perspective and lifestyle. If you believe that we all live in one world, characterized by diversity, the acts of communicating, translating and extending hospitality become possible.</p>



<p>Secondly, it is <em>faith</em> in plurality: faith exists in the plural. Consequently, different expressions of faith are appraised as revolving around the Transcendent, approached in different ways.</p>



<p>The title of my book &#8220;Faith in the Plural&#8221; implies, therefore, honoring plurality (faith in the <em>plural</em>) &nbsp;and, more specifically, honoring religious plurality (<em>faith</em> in the plural).&nbsp; The first is appreciating the diversity of the world and the second is a fundamental commitment to a philosophic and theological pluralism, similar to John Hick.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is a dialogical approach?</strong></p>



<p>Dialogue follows Peter Berger to embrace the complexity of the world; following Levinas it interrupts one’s monologue, and similar to Paul Knitter strives for social justice.</p>



<p>A dialogical approach allows that the other interrupts one&#8217;s own monologue. In a genuine conversation or meeting, what the other says or does may become relevant for one&#8217;s own position. Dialogue is necessarily transformational. Although dialogue is not always possible, it remains a challenge and opens unexpected perspectives. With their unique make up, persons are also interconnected.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A dialogical or interreligious theology goes beyond sameness and otherness, beyond radical dissimilation and radical assimilation, through respect for different lifestyles and the reality of communication. In search for meaning, dialogical theology is essentially pluralist and, as such, this pluralized theology is an alternative for age-old religious conflicts. Fear of the religious other has been an obstacle for the shaping of a heterogeneous, democratic society. Dialogue overcomes this fear by working with deep listening to others with a view of mending a fractured world by getting involved with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dialogue as I conceive it is not easy. It aims at creating a relational I and a dialogical society in which one strives for equality and social justice. &nbsp;There are limits to dialogue. People can become so entangled with evil that transformation is impossible. With such persons, not dialogue, but justice is needed. With radicalized extremists and (religious) fanatics dialogue is impossible.</p>



<p>Dialogical theology emphasizes interaction between religions in view of the creation of peaceful societies. It is a pluralized theology, in which interreligious dialogue&nbsp; interrupts one&#8217;s own religious narrative and in which interreligious dialogue&nbsp; is transformational, as&nbsp; every authentic dialogue.</p>



<p>Dialogue embraces the complexity of the world, interrupts one&#8217;s own monologue and strives for a democratic society and social justice.</p>



<p><strong>3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What are the characteristics of dialectic theology?</strong></p>



<p>Dialogical theology has a number of characteristics:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>A first condition for dialogical theology is to be <em>humble</em>. Since there are many religious others who organize their lives around the Ineffable, one has to recognize that one is not the only one to talk about what cannot be defined. Humility is required once one realizes that one&#8217;s own religion is only one color in the multicolored garment of Joseph.</li><li>&nbsp;<em>Translation</em> is a second characteristic of dialogical theology. It is an important criterion for a successful interreligious dialogue. Translating is not only a possibility, but also a duty because of the valuable &#8220;trans-different&#8221; relationship with religious others. In a good translation, one avoids radical assimilation without links to what is outside as well as radial dissimilation without bridging that allows for contact. In translation, uniqueness and bridging paradoxically belong together. It implies openness, crossing borders and bridging. Translation is an act of peace because one communicates the own in terms of the other. Because we live in <em>one</em>, shared world, translation and communication are possible and necessary. No religion is so unique that it cannot be understood by people, who do not belong to that religion.</li><li>Respect for the <em>uniqueness</em> of religious others is a third condition of my dialogical theology. Religious others are incomparably unique. There are many ways to the Transcendence. In deep listening to religious others outside and inside our own group, one may learn a lot. There is no other way than one&#8217;s own way. That is true for all those in one&#8217;s own group and for the many others outside our own group. In dialogical theology, uniqueness and translatability are not opposed.</li><li>In dialogical theology, one welcomes the other and allows her to enter into one&#8217;s own world. <em>Extending hospitality</em> to the other and paying visit to the other&#8217;s home are lofty human possibilities that bridge between worlds. Passing to the world of the religious other or allowing the other to visit our world necessarily change us. It may lead to critical questioning of the own tradition and to enriching our personal religious existence. Welcoming the other is basic in all real dialogue.</li><li>Last but not least, <em>learning</em> from the religious other is crucial in interreligious theology. Religious persons who meet religious others may enrich their own spiritual life, reread their own home tradition and creatively shape it.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><strong>4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the concept of trans-difference?</strong></p>



<p>The concept of trans-difference is central in my dialogical theology. It lies at the heart of the interreligious dialogue. The term brings together differences and a bridge between differences. By using this term, I avoid the danger of a closed identity that does not recognize one&#8217;s belonging to the entire world as well as a kind of universality that absorbs particularity.</p>



<p>In trans-difference one belongs to a specific group as well as to the general world. Belonging indicates pertaining to a particular group. It also designated relatedness to universal mankind. The relation between belonging to a singular community and to the broader circle of human kind is sometimes harmonious. Frequently it is characterized by tension and conflicts. Trans-difference combines both realms of belonging. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Trans-difference&#8221; respects different, specific, contextualized viewpoints and, at the same time, promotes connectivity and communication. It affirms differences and goes beyond them in non-indifference. It creates an open, dynamic identity that has otherness in itself.</p>



<p><strong>5)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How is interreligious dialogue testimony (or witness)?</strong></p>



<p>The recognition of the other and the care for her are a &#8220;testimony.&#8221; Testimony  is a fundamental category in the meeting with the religious other. Through the tact of contraction of the I before the other and through deep listening to her,  the glory of the Most High.</p>



<p>Listening to religious others without an agenda is in itself a testimony to the Infinite. By enlarging our religious worldview, we come to a fuller appreciation of the Transcendent. Interreligious dialogue could promote a religiosity based upon human rights and a shared humanity and testify to the intimate relation between divine revelation and mending the world.</p>



<p>Testimony or witness is a clearly religious notion. In my understanding, testimony interrupts a violent way of being, it is a sign, pointing to an elevated, non-violent world. Different religions testify in different ways to the Transcendent and may become a &#8220;sign&#8221; for each other. &#8220;Testimony&#8221; (&#8216;edut) and &#8220;sign&#8221; (nes) are Jewish categories that fit a dialogical theology from a Jewish vantage point.</p>



<p>Inspired by Levinas, I deem that in responding to the other and in the ethical meeting with her, the &#8216;I&#8217; testifies to the Infinite. In Levinas&#8217;s philosophy of the other, the one who says &#8220;Here I am&#8221; before the other testifies to the glory of the Infinite. The &#8216;I&#8217; becomes a witness of the Infinite in taking infinite responsibility of the other. Applying Levinas&#8217;s ethical metaphysics to the field of interreligious dialogue, I conceive true dialogue as a testimony: in openness and non-indifference to and care for the religious other, one bears testimony.&nbsp; Holiness resides in testifying to a God who hears the cries and sees the tears of oppressed people.</p>



<p><strong>6)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happens to truth claims in your approach?</strong></p>



<p>I suggest not to focus upon truth as a complex of sentences with which one has to agree. In Hebrew <em>èmèt</em>, truth, is rather related to trust and confidence. One could focus upon peace, which is higher than truth.</p>



<p>In a dialogical theology, truth comes into being in dialogue. &#8220;Truth sprouts from the earth&#8221; (Ps. 85:11), from beneath, in the pursuit of justice and a good life for all and in dialogue and loving relationships with others. In Jewish thinking, one <em>does</em> the truth. Instead of searching for abstract truth, one may search for a meaningful life and for cross-bordering values. The aim of truth is peace and peace conditions the search for truth. Recognition precedes cognition. Attitudes more than words give access to the Transcendent. In my view, truth is relational and linked to the transformation of the human being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More important than truth claims is the praxis of ethical behavior. The tree is known by its fruits. A rigorous position of the defenders of the gate easily becomes aggressive. We do not know God as He/She/It is. John Hick who created the modern pluralistic position, thought all religions are just attempts to grasp the Real.</p>



<p>The Transcendent &#8211; what John Hick calls the Real &#8211; is &#8220;known&#8221; within human values and within one&#8217;s ethical way of living. All religious traditions have human concepts about the Real (Adonai, the Trinity, Allah, or Vishnu, Brahman, Tao or Nirvana) which are not the Real itself, but rather human responses to the Real. In this perspective, it is forbidden to absolutize any experience of the Transcendent.</p>



<p>Absolute truth claims led, and lead, to much violence and intolerance. History shows that much violence has been done if one defends the exclusivity of one&#8217;s religion or its superiority over other religions, which are seen as false or less true. Absolute truth claims disregard intra- and inter-religious plurality. Dogmatic thinking with a lack of openness may become coercive and exclusive and block the way to a religious search.</p>



<p>The problem with religious people is that often they consider God as their God, without recognizing that their God is also the God of others and that &#8220;no religion is an island,&#8221; as Heschel felicitously phrased it. Another great thinker, Franz Rosenzweig, noted that God did not create religion, he created the world. This makes religions relative; they all exist in view of mending the world. He also adds that God is the truth, in which human beings participate. Truth is always truth-for-us and therefore relative, without relativism. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>7)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is this relativism?</strong></p>



<p>John Hick and the pluralist position does not say that all religions are the same. Hick, and followers of the pluralistic position, are not relativists. Hick merely says that the Real is not what is known from it through our conceptual apparatus and that also others have salvific paths to the Transcendent. &nbsp;He&nbsp; disagrees with the position that one presents one&#8217;s own religion as the only true one. Rather, all religions are an approach to the Transcendent.</p>



<p>One does not have to leave one&#8217;s own religious narrative in order to recognize that diversity has to be accepted and celebrated. Excessive love for the own makes us forget the other. The own religious love story does not prevent one from appreciating the religious love stories of others. It is not relativistic to recognize, as did the Yemenite Jewish theologian Nathanel ben Fayyumi in the 12<sup>th</sup> century, that God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language. More psychologically phrased: different religions correspond to different human needs. </p>



<p>Before my mixed public of Orthodox and non-Othodox Jews I explain that cultures and subcultures have different ways of relating to the Most High</p>



<p><strong>8)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is Schmidt-Leukel’s fractal position?</strong></p>



<p>John Hick was a pioneer who made a Copernican revolution in theology to sees all religions as attempts to understand the transcendental Real.  Theology is a form of poetics and symbols to express the Real.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel&#8217;s interreligious theology continues Hick&#8217;s pluralism. However, Schmidt-Leukel &nbsp;conceives of theology as &#8220;science,&#8221; in search for truth. His emphasis is more upon the cognitive dimension of the diverse beliefs.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel discerns fractal patterns in the various religions following Benoît Mendelbrot, who used the term &#8220;fractals&#8221; for patterns that display self-similarity across various scales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With his &#8220;fractal&#8221;&#8216; interpretation of religions, Perry argues that there is a fractal face also in cultural and religious diversity. His fractal interpretation of religious diversity is on the inter-religious, intra-religious and intra-subjective levels. He claims that the diversity <em>among</em> religions is also present <em>within</em> the religions and within the religious orientation of individuals. If one follows his argument, the different religions (and cultures) are less separated than might be thought at first sight: they have regular structures that return, but also irregularities that point to different contexts and arrangements.</p>



<p>Already Wilfred Cantwell Smith called for a world theology or global theology. Perry&#8217;s creative, pluralist &#8220;interreligious theology&#8221; perceives fractal structures in the religious diversity and encourages interreligious comparisons and learning.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel&#8217;s model is unity in diversity, unity in difference. He claims that &#8220;[r]eligions resemble each other, but they resemble each other in their diversity.&#8221; His main point is that, if religions are not intelligible to each other, we could not understand other cultures at all: religions are never totally other. He assesses diversity and complementarity. Different religious types are all part of the human experience. This phenomenological view allows for comparability.</p>



<p>Perry Schmidt-Leukel&#8217;s model of interreligious theology greatly contributed to the pluralist revolution in theology in offering a theory that explains the interconnectedness of religions and the possibility of interreligious learning.</p>



<p>9) <strong>Where do you differ from Schmidt-Leukel’s fractal position?</strong></p>



<p>I agree with Perry that comparability is possible since our own experience is part of the experiences of humankind. With my &#8220;trans-difference,&#8221; I interpret religious uniqueness differently.</p>



<p>First, in my view, this does not mean that everything is comparable. Certain incommensurabilities preclude the translatability of all things into something else, as well as the reduction of all otherness to structurally identical or analogous elements. My point is that, just as languages possess words and expressions that are idiomatic, religions have an otherness that is not reducible to sameness.</p>



<p>Perry looks for compatibilities in order to create a communication platform. To my mind, some elements in religions are not compatible with each other, not overlapping and not parallel, but rather radically different. I agree that translating religious categories is a possibility and even a necessity, but should less than complete comprehensibility and complete transparency not be possible? The Jewish love of the Law, for example, greatly differs &nbsp;from the Christian freedom as free from the Law. From a Jewish vantage point, the Christian recognition and appreciation of this Jewish specificity is vital in the Jewish-Christian encounter.</p>



<p>Perry too recognizes limited incommensurable elements in religions, but his emphasis is more on comparability and translatability than on incomparable uniqueness. Consciousness of uniqueness does not necessarily lead to feelings of exclusivity or superiority. In fact, recognition of the uniqueness of religious others is a constituent in my dialogical theology, which combines uniqueness and sharing a common world.</p>



<p>Second, my interreligious dialogical theology is much more deed-centered than Perry&#8217;s. I interpret interreligious pluralism in an ethical way.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My dialogical theology comes closer to Paul Knitter&#8217;s soteriocentric model, which combines a theology of religions with a strong commitment to mend the world. In my dialogical theology, I put the emphasis upon genuine, transformational dialogue, in which the question whether theological utterances are compatible with each other is less important than the moral quality present in the various responses to the inconceivable reality.</p>



<p><strong>10)&nbsp; What is an ethical interpretation of interreligious pluralism?</strong></p>



<p>With his creative and sophisticated fractal interpretation of religious diversity, Perry Schmidt-Leukel conceives theology as a &#8220;science,&#8221; in search for truth. His emphasis is upon the cognitive dimension of the diverse beliefs.</p>



<p>My dialogical theology is more about trust than about truth. Dialogical theology involves deep listening and perfecting society by getting involved with (religious) others. In this pluralized theology, peace is more elevated than truth and does not have to retreat before truth. It is rather the result of the common search for meaning, which is present in different religious groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I emphasize the ethical dimension in the different religions. From my perspective, the aim of truth is to bring peace. To be attentive to the other and take care of her is above the rational order of truth.</p>



<p>Perry has a logocentric fractal interpretation of religious plurality. My interreligious theology is characterized by a deed-centered approach to religions.</p>



<p>A pluralized theology is not primarily the result of knowing more religions or knowing them better (although that is important too), it is first of all about <em>re</em>cognition of the other. Being present to religious others and listening to them without hidden agenda is a &#8220;testimony&#8221; to the Infinite. By enlarging our religious world, we come to a fuller appreciation of the Transcendent, approachable in care for the other human being.</p>



<p><strong>11)&nbsp; You quote a wide variety of Jewish pluralists, are you basically in agreement with them? Your list includes among others the diverse approaches of Kogan, and Zalman-Schachter-Shalomi?</strong></p>



<p>One may cherish and love one&#8217;s own religion and, at the same time, take seriously the encounter with religious others. Travelling in a multi-religious world does not diminish in any way love for the own religion, in which and from which one lives. We shape our identities, but we are also shaped by others, intra- and inter-religiously.</p>



<p>Michael Kogan in his <em>Opening the Covenant</em> (Oxford 2007) seeks to include Christianity within God’s covenant with Jewish people.  He quotes Paul in 1Cor. 9:22 who claims that he became “all things to all people so that by all means some might be saved” and asks “why cannot God do the same thing?” For Kogan, “all faith are true that lead us from egocentricity to participation in the infinite life with all its ethical and spiritual blessings.” I am in agreement with his pluralist view that God reveals different truth to different peoples in different historical circumstances. Kogan opens up the covenant and develops a multiple revelation theory, which states that others too have a covenant with God. He is also right in writing that Catholic ecclesiolatry, Protestant scriptolatry and Jewish ethnolatry want to replace the infinite with finite forms. Kogan formulates his pluralism in this way. I do not work with different revelations or covenants, but with the term “trans-difference,” which is a philosophical notion, more fitting for a dialogical theology.</p>



<p>Zalman Schachter-Shalomi develops Jewish theological insights on Jesus. A Jewish look at the Gospels is relevant for those Christians, who want to understand Jesus better in his Jewish historical and cultural setting. For instance, Buber&#8217;s view on Jesus, as developed in his <em>Two Types of Faith</em>, is useful for Christians, who frequently interpret Jesus in light of later dogmatic developments. Buber situated Jesus in the series of Suffering Servants. Schachter-Shalomi goes beyond the historical Jesus who preached good moral behavior and see him as &#8220;axis mundi&#8221; for his followers. According to Schachter-Shalomi, Kabbalah offers a model of divine embodiment. In this perspective, Jesus is an &#8220;incarnate of Torah.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Schachter-Shalomi&#8217;s view on a more transcendent Jesus differs from the classical Jewish one, which takes distance from the divinization of finite human beings. Yet, what is forbidden for Jews can be allowed for non-Jews. The views of Kogan &amp; Schachter-Shalomi go beyond a confessional Jewish theology. They interact with Christianity and engage in a dialogue with Christians.   </p>



<p><strong>12)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happens to a fixed religious identity in your approach?</strong></p>



<p>In my view, &#8220;trans-difference&#8221; creates an open identity that has otherness in itself. The loftiness of the human being resides in the realization that the I is always linked to the non-I and that interconnectedness ruptures one&#8217;s totalizing tendencies. Interconnectedness brings us out of our cocoon, in humble service of the other. This a life long task.</p>



<p>However, frequently, religious persons define themselves in contrast to others. Religious others are often met with animosity and a-priori assumptions instead of sympathetic listening. The alternative for such a fixed religious identity is a dynamic identity, open to others. In a dynamic religious identity, one discovers that one belongs to the entire world, in which a plurality of religions testifies to the Transcendent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A dialogical theology is about crossing borders and leaving fixed identities in openness to others, without losing one&#8217;s own embedment in concrete cultural and historical contexts. In dialogue with religious others, one may become conscious that many other traditions also approach the Transcendent in their own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Religious identities are linked to religious traditions. However, these traditions are ambiguous. Ideally, they are a dynamic process and develop continually. Practically, they are frequently absolutized. Traditions should be conscious that they are not the divine source itself, but only a response to it. As other human realities, they may reflect divine realities that become manifest in human connectivity. They may also become inhuman, violent and cruel. The million dollar question is if religious traditions will be able to exercise self-contraction and give room to each other. Traditions may instrumentalize the Transcendent in function of the own interests, producing shaming, blaming, exclusion, discrimination, violence and war. They may serve themselves as particularistic traditions, divorced from values. Alternatively, they are particular expressions of a universal bond in favor of a unified humanity. The choice is between love of the own by excluding the other or cultivate a universal belonging in one&#8217;s own unique way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The success of dialogical theology depends upon the elasticity and willingness of (the adherents to) traditions to connect to the Divine through peaceful and dialogical relationships. One may creatively revisit and reimagine the own tradition in light of what one learns from others. A critical participation in a religious tradition allows for experiencing, experimenting, creativity and change. A non fixed, dynamic identity avoids making a caricature of the other and creates the possibility of an expanded &#8220;we.&#8221; It places relationality again at the heart of the religious experience.</p>



<p><strong>13)&nbsp; What does the Rabbinic concept of chosen people mean?</strong></p>



<p>Chosenness is something positive: it is the privilege of having duties. In traditional Jewish life and thought, God loves the Jewish people &#8220;with great love.&#8221; Before the reading of the Torah, we bless God &#8220;who has chosen us from all the nations.&#8221; Love is always linked to chosenness. One is chosen in order to be responsible for others. In this sense, every human being is chosen to be there for others. Chosenness is not haughtiness, it is rather an election to be in dialogical relation with the (religious) others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is the second part to our interview with Rabbi Dr. Yakov Nagen (formerly Genack) he is Ra”M in Yeshivat Othniel. <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/03/rabbi-dr-yakov-nagen-be-become-bless/">&nbsp;(Part 1 is here)</a> This one comes after his successful American book tour.  </p>

<p>This second part presents the topics that some consider Nagen&#8217;s greatest contribution, his approaches to Torah study. Much of this interview pertains to his book &nbsp;—<em>Water, Creation and Divinity: Sukkot in the Philosophy of Halacha [Hebrew]&nbsp;</em>(Giluy 2008, forthcoming in English) as well as his interfaith encounters with Palestinians in the Holy Land. </p>



<p>Rabbi Nagen is part of the trend that coalesced starting in the 1980’s around, but not limited to, Rabbi Shagar z”l. The rabbis sought to move beyond learning in a formal manner to learning for meaning. One can compare Rabbi Nagen to others in this approach including Rabbis Dryfus, Dov Zinger, and <a href="http://hakirah.org/Vol21Brandes.pdf">Yehudah Brandes</a>. For all of them, there are many methods of learning and many approaches to study Talmud. We should not be locked into a single method. (See the discussion in Rabbi Yuval Cherlow&#8217;s book on Torat Eretz Yisrael, 1998).  </p>



<p>Rav Nagen’s emphasis is on the integration of Aggadah into the study of Talmud and into halakhah. Below are some examples pertaining to Sukkah and Arba Minim. I am not sure how clear they are to &nbsp;someone who has not studied the tractate. </p>



<p>With great hyperbole, back in 2000 Rabbi
Yuval Cherlow declared Rav Nagen as the new Rabbi Soloveitchik for our time in
that the latter brought Kant and Existentialism into Torah and Rav Nagen is
bringing comparative religion. While clearly and embarrassingly overstated, it
does show a world of Roshei Yeshiva who see methods of learning as changing and
as open to the wider world.</p>



<p>Rav Nagen also has integrated study of Zohar into his Talmud shiur. They do not study it as a side activity of knowing the world of the sefirot. Rather, Rabbi Nagan uses it to teach about contemporary relationship and to derive new customs. For example, he encourages his students to say when dating: “For the sake of the unification between the Holy Blessed One and His Shechinah” and that couples should say the evening shema together. A burst of new ritual creativity worthy of 16th century Safed. </p>



<p>Finally, this interview is his
discussion of his work with local Palestinians and his visit to Al-Azhar
University to share a common belief in one God. Nagen was a friend and student
of Rabbi Menachem Froman of Tekoa z”l, well known for his emphasis on
interfaith and peace.</p>



<h2><strong>Torah study </strong></h2>



<p><strong>1) &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; How does your Beit midrash seek meaning and</strong><strong> spirituality beyond the more analytic Litvish approaches?</strong></p>



<p>I think what is most
exciting about Beit Midrash is its constantly evolving dynamic nature. When the
Litvish approach was first developed in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>
century, it was an innovation. Rav Chaim Volozhin in <em>Nefesh Hachaim</em> stressed&nbsp; <em>Torah Lishmah, </em>for its own sake. </p>



<p>I see the
methodologies that I use not as replacements but further developments.&nbsp; Classical <em>lamdanot</em> focused on a conceptional
analysis that is often deliberately formalist and abstract. Distinctions in
Brisk deal with defining the &#8220;What&#8221; and not asking the
&#8220;Why.&#8221; For me there were two distinct phases of my development beyond
classical <em>lamdanot.</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>A
major thesis of Rav Shagar’s book <em>&#8220;Uvetorato yahaga&#8221;</em>&nbsp; is his distinction between two basic
approaches to the relationship between Torah and life- Brisker abstraction and
his approach of meaning. </p>



<p>The
first, the Brisker approach, views the Torah as divine and eternal in which the
Torah is abstract and autonomous, and thereby disjoint from life and reality.
The Torah being alienated from the nature flow of life is, in most aspects, a Brisker
dogma and ideal. They created a closed language of <em>lamdanut</em>, denigration
of “baalabatish” reasoning, and seeing a divide between how people think and
how the Torah thinks. They view the Torah as devoid of emotional or human
elements, thus claiming that the <em>mitzvot</em> lack reasons. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The
approach that Rav Shgar propounds, is one in which Torah can illuminate life&#8217;s
questions and challenges. One creates a linkage between the flow of life and
the Torah. Is God’s will manifested exclusively within the realm of halakha, or
can God be found within life itself? The return to <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> and the
fact that they live as part of <em>Medinat Yisrael</em> has led many in the Dati
Leumi community in Israel to choose the latter approach.</p>



<p><strong>2) How did you personally find Meaning beyond Abstraction?</strong></p>



<p>In the first stage,
while still a student as Yeshivat Har Etzion, I began working on an approach to
“Halakhic thought” (<em>machshevat</em> <em>Ha-Halakha), </em>which remains
conceptional but is more philosophic than <em>classical lamdanut. </em>The
articles I wrote then eventually evolved into my doctorate <em>&#8220;Sukkot in
Rabbinical Thought – Motifs the Halacha of Sukkot in Talmudic Literature&#8221;.</em>
</p>



<p>In
1997, a later stage in my development, I joined the Beit midrash of Otniel
founded by Rav Shagar’s students where there is a stress on seeking meaning. A
meaning which finds existential and personal significance.</p>



<p>To
give a short example of how I apply the differences: the default <em>chakira</em>
in classical lamdanut it to asking whether &#8220;<em>cheftza</em> or <em>gavra</em>&#8220;,
is it in the object or the person. In contrast, in my class it’s often the
distinction explained in my book between &#8220;Doing&#8221; and
&#8220;Being&#8221;, an action or a state of mind. Recently in Yeshiva we studied
the mitzva of Tefillin, and I argued, based on both the Biblical sources and
halachot, that the fundamental difference between the Tefillin of the head to
that of the arm is that the first is sanctifying our &#8220;Being&#8221; and the
latter our &#8220;Doing&#8221;. These are concepts that touch on life and opened
discussions about what and how tefillin can transform.</p>



<p><strong>3)&nbsp;
&nbsp;Is there a connection between the Aggada and Halacha? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Rav Zvi Yehuda
Kook often cited the Hatam Sofer that mixing Halacha and Aggada is forbidden as
a forbidden mixture (<em>kilayim)</em>. Indeed, Halacha and Aggada are
distinct genres. Lack of recognizing of the uniqueness of each can lead to a
mishmash.</p>



<p>However there is an organic connection between
that makes each essential to understand the other, in which the proper integration
can bring a deeper understanding of both.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>As a friend of mine
pointed out, <em>Kilayim</em> itself isn&#8217;t a blanket prohibition, the clothes of
the kohanim in the Beit Hamikdash were made of <em>kilayim</em>. For the record
allow me to point out, the original quote of the Hatam Sofer dealt not with
halacha and Aggada but rather with mixing halacha and kabbalah. </p>



<p>Rav Zvi Yehuda&#8217;s
statement diametrically the opposite of statements by his father, Rav Avraham
Yitzchak Kook, who has issued the most vocal call to integrate Halacha and Aggada.
</p>



<p>I begin my book on
Sukkah by quoting Rav Kook from Orot Hakoda 1:25 &nbsp;&#8220;The Halacha and the Aggada must unite
with one another….&#8221;.&nbsp; When my
efforts on the interplay of Halacha and Aggada were challenged by a colleague
who quoted to me Rav Zvi Yehuda about <em>kilayim,</em> I countered by the quote
from Orot Hakodesh. To which my critic responded: &#8220;No, no. you don&#8217;t
understand, in <em>Orot Hakodesh</em> it &nbsp;is referring to an abstract truth in the upper
worlds, not something connected to the reality that we are living in.&#8221; </p>



<p>Rav Kook the father is
motivated by his holistic and nondualist worldview that seeks to uncover the One
underlying all with a connection between Halacha and Kabbala, &nbsp;I would view this connection as based not only
on theological but on academic, literary and historical grounds. &nbsp;As Yonah Frankel, a pioneer in the study of
Aggada and midrash. has pointed out, all of our sources from <em>the Sages </em>contain
both Halakha and Aggada – the <em>Bavli</em>, <em>Yerushalmi</em>, <em>Midrashei</em>
<em>Halakha</em> and, to a lesser extent, the Mishna and Tosefta. Furthermore, the
same sages engaged in both genres </p>



<p>The idea that Halakha and Aggada are unrelated would belie all we have learnt from anthropology and comparative religion &#8211; rituals have significance and meaning and often reflect a value system. The burden of proof is on anyone who would argue that Judaism is the exception.&nbsp; Yair Lorberbaum, in his book<em>, Image of God </em>has a marvelous chapter on the relationship between Halacha and Aggada in the Sages.</p>



<p>4) <strong>How do you see this relationship between Aggada and Halacha&nbsp; in the context of your work ?</strong></p>



<p>The field of the
relation of Halacha to Aggada is relatively new.. In my doctorate &nbsp;and
book on <em>Sukkot</em>, I grapple with this challenge of working in a new field,
but there is still a long road ahead. In my work the focus would be best called
“<em>machshevat</em> <em>Ha-Halakha</em>&#8220;. I study the halakhic for its ideas
based on its sources, definitions, literary structure, and contexts within the back
and forth of the halakhic discussion.</p>



<p>In addition, through my doctoral work, I was exposed to additional fields that contributed to my research. The study of ritual and symbolism in anthropology and comparative religion, can lead to insight into Halacha. This method does not necessarily lead to “parallel-mania” between Judaism and other traditions. Often, quite the opposite results – comparison highlights what is unique about Judaism.</p>



<p>5) <strong>How does this apply to learning Sukkah? Can you offer examples? </strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;The
Aggada &nbsp;in Sukka 11b brings an opinion
that the Sukkah parallels the Divine clouds that encompassed the Jewish people
in the desert. The meaning and scope of the idea is uncovered by studying the
halachic parameters of Sukkah.</p>



<p>In Tannaic sources
eating in the Sukkah is compared to eating of Korbonot(Mishna Sukka 2:6), and other
laws derived from the seven days in which Aaron and his sons lived in the Mishkan
during the process of its consecration (Sefra Emor 17). </p>



<p>In the Amoraim the Sukkah
emerges as an abode of the divine, highlighted through its connection to the
Kodesh Kedoshim, the inner sanctuary. The minimum size of the Sukkah is derived
from the lowest level that the Shechina manifested above the Ark, or from the
size of the space between the Ark and the wings of the Cherubs above it.&nbsp; The intricate sugya in which these&nbsp; laws appear is in fact examining the relationship
between heaven and earth (Sukka 4b – 5b). </p>



<p>Looking at the
totality of the halacha calls us to see also the theme of Sukka as the home
during the course of Sukkot. Rav Yuval Cherlow once told me that in wake of my
approach of Sukka as Temple, I presumably would identify with the position that
frowns on marital relations in the Sukkah. I argued that the whole point of the
interplay between the Sukka as Temple or as home, is a vision to connect the
home and life to the holy, and the sukkah encompassing life and not dividing it,
as Tosphot points out (Sukka 43b), in the mikdash it is forbidden to sleep,
whereas on Sukkot one is obligated to sleep in the Sukka.</p>



<p><strong>6) What insights can
you offer about the Araba Minim?</strong></p>



<p>I see the Arba minim as both reflecting the divine
and as a sacrifice. </p>



<p>I point out that Rabbi
Akiva&#8217;s halachic opinion that there is only one of each Min, is reflective of
his approach that each of the Arba Minim is a symbolic representative of the
divine, thus one of each. An interesting historical point made by Professor
Sperber is that the coins from the Bar Kochba revolt have a picture of the Arba
Minim in accordance with Rabbi Akiva&#8217;s approach, which reflects the tradition
that he was the Rabbi of Bar Kochba. </p>



<p>The dominant approach,
however, in the Mishna and Talmud relates to the Arba Minim with many of the parameters
and categories of sacrifices The Aggada explicitly makes the comparison between
Arba Minim, and sacrifice.</p>



<p>Both of these
approaches to Arba Minim, as representing the divine or as sacrifice fit well
with the above conception of Sukka as Temple. In general Sukkot is the
primarily holiday of the Temple. Sukkot is the time in which Solomon dedicated
the Temple. I argue that the nightly celebration in the Temple, <em>Simchat beit
hashoava</em>, is a reenactment of the events and ceremonies behind the story of
the Temple, such as David&#8217;s wild dancing in front of the ark as a procession
leads it to Jerusalem. In the future too, the time that humanity comes to the Temple
is designated as Sukkot (Zecharia 14). &nbsp;</p>



<p><br />
<strong>7) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the role of Raphael
Patai and Mircea Eliade in your work? </strong></p>



<p>Patai was a pioneer in&nbsp; comparing Jewish ritual and those of ancient
cultures and religions. Ideas of each person being a microcosm, and of the
Temple microcosm. The cosmic significance of the water libations is illuminated
by the parallels he brings. One flaw is that he notes similarities but what
often is most interesting to me are the differences.</p>



<p>More significant for
me was the work of Eliade, to which Professor Moshe Idel, who together with
Professor Moshe Halbertal was my doctoral mentor, encouraged me to study.Eliade,
who was one of the twentieth century’s foremost scholars of religion,
contrasted two different approaches to time: the cosmological and the
historical. In the cosmological model, time is cyclical: what was is what will
be. Time flows backward, in a constant, recurring return to a mythical age.
This conception of time is derived from, among other things, the phenomena of
the natural world, which repeat every year without fail. For instance, in the
spring the flora bloom, during the year the plants dry out, and in the
following spring they grow anew. Eliade contrasts this conception, which
pervades the pagan world, with the historical view of history instilled by
Judaism. According to which time and the world are always marching forward. </p>



<p>The importance of the historical approach in Judaism lies
in the fact that it makes room for morality and values. Were that not the case,
nothing could change, and man’s actions would be meaningless. Eliade himself,
it bears noting, identified with the cosmological model: as a fascist and an
anti-Semite, he was not much enamored of the historical approach.</p>



<p>In my book on Sukkot, I argue that the Jewish
tradition did not supersede the cosmological approach, but rather added to it,
maintaining a unique synthesis between the cosmic and the historical. Sukkot
has both historical components, in the context of the story of life in the
desert and cosmic in terms of the renewal and return to nature, a theme that
also appears through laws of sukkot.</p>



<p><strong>8) What is the goal of Torah study from a
universalistic perspective?</strong></p>



<p> I believe that the role of Torah study for the Jewish people is so fundamental, touching on our deepest identity, essence, and destiny. My universalism leads to a greater emphasis on the significance of Torah study. As I don&#8217;t see the Jewish people as having different DNA or different soul as non-Jews, but rather as sharing a common humanity and image of God  (<em>tselem Elohim)</em>, therefore it is the Torah that makes us unique,  who we are and who we can become. The blessing we say on the Torah &#8220;God…who has chosen us from all the nations and given us the Torah&#8221; tells us that it is the Torah that gives us our status. The richer, deeper and more significant the Torah is, the more we grow. As a result, to fulfill our role I see the value in reaching new realms, and see openness to the world as opening up pathways to this expansion of Torah. </p>



<p>This belief reflects for me my hashkafa (worldview) of
Modern Orthodoxy. Openness to the world has a value and but also a price. I see
the challenge and obligation of Modern Orthodoxy as working to ensure that the
price we pay for our exposure to the outside world to be justified by the ways
we are blessed by this engagement.</p>



<p>Another reason why universalism leads to this imperative is the vision of the Jewish people as continuing to&nbsp; contribute to humanity through the venue of Torah – in the words of Isaiah 2:3 &#8220;From Zion will go forth Torah and the word of God from Jerusalem&#8221; . This challenges us to develop a Torah that can speak to humanity as a whole and be transformative for their lives and for their connection to God. </p>

<h2><strong>Interfaith Work </strong></h2>



<p><strong>9) &nbsp; &nbsp;Why do you engage in interfaith work with local Palestinian imams and sheikhs? What is accomplished?</strong></p>



<p>The return of the Jewish people to Eretz
Yisroel, and the birth of a Jewish State is not the end of the story but the
beginning. After two thousand years of untold suffering and determination, we
have a moral responsibility to create a state that will realize a vision that
justifies this journey of the Jewish people. We need to heal the relations
between the Jewish people and humanity, and to connect with other followers of
God in order to serve him from a place of connection and brotherhood. The state
gives us an imperative to try to make the other into a brother. </p>



<p>More and more it is recognized in Israel
the significance of religion in reaching these ends, including even the
political. The great insight of Rav Menachem Froman, my friend and mentor, was
that if religion is part of the problem, then it will have to be part of the
solution. Belief in God has the power to separate people, but it also has the
power to connect them. &nbsp;For those who believe that the other worships a
different God, faith will drive a wedge between the two parties. However, for
those who believe that we both love, cherish, and pray to the same God, belief
will only draw us closer together. </p>



<p>When it comes to Judaism and Islam, the
two primary religions in the conflict, their theology binds far more than it
divides. Jewish rabbinic literature values Islam for its belief in the unity of
one God. In the Koran, Islam grants a special status to Jews as &#8220;Ahlul
Kitab&#8221; &#8211; People of the Book. However, while these theological tenets may
lay the foundation in principle, peaceful relations between peoples can and
will only be built through direct encounter, through laying down the bricks one
at a time. The work comes through real life meetings between persons of
different faiths, opportunities to acknowledge and encounter the Other’s
religious and ethnic identity. </p>



<p>For years I have been active in
interfaith meetings both in Israel proper and the West Bank, largely under the
auspices of two organizations – the Abrahamic Reunion (AR) and the Interfaith
Encounter Association (IEA). &nbsp;I see the power of these sessions as
twofold. First, such meetings have the power to change what the attendees think
about the Other. Second, and perhaps more significantly, these encounters take
those truths one already knows cerebrally and brings them down from the head to
the heart, turning them into a living existential reality. </p>



<p>Human connections alone cannot be a
substitute for political solutions, but they create fertile ground for
solutions to develop and ultimately flourish. These connections can help ensure
success of any future resolution and open up new possibilities to finding an
optimal solution for all parties.</p>



<p><strong>10) Why did you visit Al Azhar in Egypt?</strong></p>



<p>On several
occasions, I hosted my friend Dr. Omer Salem at Yeshivat Otniel who lectured to
our students. At one point he offered to host me in Cairo at his University, Al
Azhar University. Al Azhar was founded more than a thousand years ago and is
one of Sunni Islam&#8217;s most important institutions. I realized that there is ongoing
debate in Egypt about who are the Jewish people and thought that be going there
an ability to impact on this discussion, so together with Dr. Joseph Ringel and
Rebecca Abramson (a haredi journalist) we set out for Cairo.</p>



<p>Omer
wrote his doctorate at Al Azhar University, on the topic of the status of Jews
and Judaism according to Islam. This is the same topic that the former Grand
Imam of Al Azhar Muhammad Sayyid
Tantawy, wrote his thesis, on Ahlul Kitab, the people of the book.&nbsp; They however reached opposite conclusions. According
to Tantawy, Islam has a negative attitude toward the Jews. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;[The] Qur&#8217;an describes the Jews with their own particular degenerate characteristics, i.e. killing the prophets of Allah, corrupting His words by putting them in the wrong places, consuming the people&#8217;s wealth frivolously, refusal to distance themselves from the evil they do, and other ugly characteristics caused by their deep-rooted lasciviousness &#8230; only a minority of the Jews keep their word. &#8230; [A]ll Jews are not the same. The good ones become Muslims, the bad ones do not.&#8221;&nbsp; </p></blockquote>



<p>In contrast, Omer
took the opposite approach and saw as what he believes is the positive
conception of the Jews in Koran as the key to reconciliation in the Middle East
as he argues in his book, <em>The Missing Peace: The Role of Religion
in the Arab-Israeli Conflict</em><em>.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>There are, however, Jewish believers with whom Islam has no problem. Surah 3 says that there is ‘a party of the people of the Scripture [who] stand for the right, they recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer.’ The Quran praises the Jews for obeying the Torah.”</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;“[If your ways are pleasing to Allah], even your enemies will become your lovers. Remember that you are the chosen people. You may doubt that Islam appreciates and respects the Jews, but when Muslims ruled the world they were the protectors of the Jews. My vision is to restore this attitude. I want to say to my Muslim brothers and sisters: You are not the enemies of the Jews, you are their protectors.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>11) Who did you meet with while at Al-Azhar University ?</strong></p>



<p>We
met with some of the professors there. </p>



<p>Dr.
Bakr Zaki Awad, the dean of the School of Theology whose specialty is the
relationship between the Torah, the New Testament and the Quran, yet he had
never met a rabbi in his life. He had a lot of powerful questions to raise
about Judaism. One issue he raised was that Muslims want everyone to be
Muslims, but Jews don’t seem to care who becomes Jewish. He saw this as Jewish
antipathy towards other people. I told him that the Torah starts with our
common humanity in the story of Adam, where we are told that all of humanity is
created in the image of God. Judaism sees itself as having a role to play in
the story of humanity, but not that everyone should be Jewish. Our role is to
awaken certain values and a connection from God to humanity, which we see for
example in the seven Noahide laws. We see in Islam a fulfillment of that
vision.</p>



<p>When we visited the University of Fayum where we met another
professor of Omers&#8217;. When he heard we were Jewish, he told us a very sweet
story: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One day someone came and knocked on the gate of the palace identifying himself as the brother of the Caliph. The visitor is ushered in, but the Caliph isn’t able to recognize his brother. The Caliph asks, “Are you my brother through my mother?” “No” is the reply. “Are you my brother through my father?” Again the answer in negative. The caliph continues to think and finally asks again, “Are you my brother in Islam?” The visitor answers, “I am not a Muslim. ”“So how are you my brother?” asks the Caliph. “I am your brother as all of us are children of Adam and Eve.” The Caliph responds: “You are right. I will treat you as my brother to demonstrate this to the world.”</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Integrating Zohar into</strong> our Lives</h2>



<p><strong>12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is Zohar study important for today’s yeshiva?</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;I mentioned in the previous interview Rav Kook
opening statement to &#8220;For the Perplexed of the Generation&#8221;–
&#8220;That Humanity is created in the image of God,</p>



<p>this is the
essence of the entire Torah&#8221; I see the connection of the human and the
divine as the fundamental idea of the Kabbala, the heart of which is the
Zohar.&nbsp; I see the power of this concept
as sanctifying and empowering all human life and interpersonal relations as
well as human endeavors.</p>



<p><strong>13) How do your current shiurim on Zohar focus on love in the Zohar?</strong></p>



<p>The love songs of Shiur HaShirim between the
male and the female, which is in the words of Rabbi Akiva, the holy of the
holiest (Mishna Yadaim 3:5), is an allegory, but the question is for what? The
traditional answer is for the love between God and the Jewish people. Within
the teachings of Rabbi Akiva it is clear that the realm of the divine includes
also the earthly love between man and wife (Sotah 17). </p>



<p>The Zohar adds a third
dimension to these love songs, as the love and yearning within the realm of the
divine, between HaKadosh Baruch Hu and the Shekhinah. What is critical and
often missed is the dynamics and interrelation between these three dimensions.
Or as I tell my students that before going on a date to say “For the sake of
the unification between the Holy Blessed One and His Shechinah &#8220;&#8221;לשם ייחוד קודשה בריך הוא ושכינתיה . </p>



<p>Often passages that
the commentators see as abstracting dealing within the divine realm, I will ask
what this could means when actualized in the human realm and applied to our
interpersonal lives.. </p>



<p>There is a beautiful
teaching in the Zohar at the beginning of&nbsp;
Shir HaSHirim, that a kiss of love has four spirits, <em>ruchot</em>, &nbsp;in it. It can be explained abstractly about the
interaction between heavenly sefirot but also as an insight our interpersonal
relations.&nbsp; Two people in a relationship are
really four spirits. Each person has their own individuality but in time each
encompasses something of the other, and gives it a new form, thus in a relationship
there are four spirits connect.</p>



<p>Another teaching in
the Zohar on love is in Parshat Teruma that the source of the four letter name
of God, the tetragrammaton is the very similar four letter Hebrew word, <em>Ahava</em>,
love, which the Zohar states the letters of which&nbsp; &#8220;above and below are dependent&#8221;
(Zohar Teruma 146a). So love increase God’s presence. </p>



<p>14) &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Explain how do you think the Zohar wants us to do Shema as a couple?</strong></p>



<p>The earliest time of Shema in the morning is
when there is enough light for one to see his friend (Shulchan Arukh 58a).&nbsp; Rav Reem HaKohen once explained that the
reason is that Shema is accepting God&#8217;s majesty upon us and in Judaism, as by
Sinai, this should not be done alone but with others. </p>



<p>My first thought was
that the corollary should be that at night, the Shema said before going to
sleep should be said with ones&#8217; spouse. &nbsp;I later discovered many passages in the Zohar
stressing the great unity of Shema is the unity between male and female. For
example the Zohar terumah (133b) says that the first phrase
&#8220;shema…ehad&#8221; is the inner unity of the groom, the second
&#8220;Baruch….Voed&#8221; is the bride entering modestly into the huppah and
thus this is said in a whisper. Or &#8220;all mitzot each reflect either the
masculine or of the feminine, the exception being Shema which is unity as thus has
both (Zohar Hadash Ruth 110a) &nbsp;The
explicit meaning of these passages is that this is about the unity between
those aspects of the divine, but in my approach to Zohar I see this as actualized
also in the partnership of a couple together accepting God. </p>

<p>One of my major points is that you cannot compare 21st century Judaism to 5th century BCE Hinduism.  Contemporary Jews are not practicing sacrifice, fighting molekh or marrying off their minor daughters, rather following a contemporary application. Similarly, American Hindus have define themselves as a theistic worship as embedded in Temples that function as American style social centers with youth groups, social halls, and Sunday school. You have to compare like to like. </p>



<p>A second one of my major points is the vast variety of forms of Hinduism and Hindu thinkers.  One cannot make sweeping generalizations about the many religions and denominations that coalesced in the 17th century to be called Hinduism. There are more members of any minor Hindu sect than there are Jews in the world. There are 1.15 Billion Hindus. There are many theologies.  </p>



<p>Third, please top judging them without any knowledge or based on 2 lectures in an intro to religion class or a google search. They do not like being judged with Western eyes or by those who make them exotic. Also, please immediately stop assuming they are too simple to understand their own religion.  </p>



<p>I did not deal with the halakhic issues, I will leave that to Rabbi Prof Daniel Sperber and others.  </p>



<p>I am already working on several other books and applying for grants to write them. </p>



<p>When I posed this a few days ago on Facebook, someone half jokingly and half seriously asked:who is going to do the author interview with me and who will be the respondent?</p>



<p>The book arrived on October 31 and is available via the publisher <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498597081/Rabbi-on-the-Ganges-A-Jewish-Hindu-Encounter">Lexington Books. </a> I apologize about hard cover price but my contract explicitly stipulated that it goes into paperback in 12 months. There is a 30% off coupon below- valid until 12/31.  Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rabbi-Ganges-Jewish-Hindu-Alan-Brill/dp/1498597084">Amazon</a> offered 30% off the book back in April when it had no cover, no blurbs, and no description. But <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498597081/Rabbi-on-the-Ganges-A-Jewish-Hindu-Encounter">Lexington Books</a> is offering a discount. The paperback should be out by  December 2020.</p>

<p><em>Rabbi on the Ganges: A Jewish-Hindu Encounter</em>&nbsp;is the first work to engage the new terrain of Hindu-Jewish religious encounter.</p>



<p>The book offers understanding into points of contact between the two religions of Hinduism and Judaism. Providing an important comparative account, the work illuminates key ideas and practices within the traditions, surfacing commonalities between the jnana and Torah study, karmakanda and Jewish ritual, and between the different Hindu philosophic schools and Jewish thought and mysticism, along with meditation and the life of prayer and Kabbalah and creating dialogue around ritual, mediation, worship, and dietary restrictions. The goal of the book is not only to unfold the content of these faith traditions but also to create a religious encounter marked by mutual and reciprocal understanding and openness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>

This work is the best comparative analysis ever of Jewish and Hindu philosophy and religious thought. Brill knows his Jewish sources impeccably, and with skilled observations of daily life and engaging dialogues with Hindu thinkers and texts, we accompany him on his journey. This is a groundbreaking dialogue, and through Brill’s appreciative eyes Hindus and Jews will come to understand both the other and themselves in a new way. It has my highest recommendation.<br /><strong>—&nbsp;</strong><strong>Nathan Katz, Distinguished Professor, Emeritus, Florida International University</strong></p>



<p>The late Swami Dayananda Saraswati declared Hinduism and Judaism to be the two fountainheads of Religion in our world—the one of the Abrahamic traditions and the other of the Dharmic religions. Yet for the most part in the course of history, the two have remained foreign to one another.</p>



<p>In recent times this has changed dramatically, not least of all reflected in the fact that India is frequently the preferred destination of young Israeli Jews. However serious attempts to understand the religious world of the other have been rare. Alan Brill’s book is an impressive pioneering work in this regard and will enable those familiar with Jewish teaching to gain a serious comprehensive understanding of Hindu religious thought, practice, and devotion. Moreover the clarity and insights he provides will enlighten not only Jews, but all those who wish to gain understanding of the rich wisdom and forms of Hindu religious life.<br /><strong>—&nbsp;Rabbi David Rosen, International Director of Interreligious Affairs</strong>, AJC</p>



<p>Brill succeeds in juxtaposing a comprehensive introduction to Hindu history, thought, and practice with personal reflections drawn from his experiences in India. A Highly readable contribution to the growing field of Indo-Judaic studies, and an invitation to further Hindu-Jewish dialogue.<br /><strong>—&nbsp;</strong><strong>Yudit Kornberg Greenberg, George D. and Harriet W. Cornell Endowed Chair of Religion, Rollins College</strong></p>



<p>Rabbi, professor, traveler, storyteller, spiritual seeker, all of these roles have woven together to enable an outstanding achievement: Alan Brill&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>Rabbi on the Ganges</em>. This book serves both as an introduction to Hinduism and also as a comparative study of Hinduism and Judaism. Brill has an ability to sift between the essential and the trivial that allows this introduction to be significant and meaningful, exploring the history of Hinduism and its variety of denominations and philosophies.</p>



<p>Despite the enormous amount of information, the book doesn&#8217;t feel dense but rather very readable. In terms of the comparison to Judaism, there are insights both relating to the rituals and practices of these religions but also the deep spiritual teaching. Brill also shows parallel developments in both religions, such as regarding the status of women and responses to modernity.</p>



<p>One of the most significant messages of the book is showing how the contemporary Jewish view of Hinduism is based on a Hinduism of antiquity rather than the Hinduism of today. For me, this book has been transformative, and I believe that it will form a basis for a fruitful relationship between Judaism and Hinduism.<br /><strong>—&nbsp;</strong><strong>Rabbi Yakov Nagen, senior educator Otniel Yeshiva</strong></p>

<p>In honor of Bereshit, here is Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan on reading Genesis as presenting the truths of 20<sup>th</sup> century science, as discussing a world 2 billion years old with humans as existing for 25,000 years. </p>



<p> This is part VII in a series on Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan- for biography see&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/aryeh-kaplan-a-lost-homily-from-his-d-c-pulpit-and-outreach-at-suny-albany/">Part I</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/lost-rabbi-aryeh-kaplan-part-ii/">Part II,&nbsp;</a><a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/lost-rabbi-aryeh-kaplan-part-iii/">Part III,</a><a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/rabbi-aryeh-kaplan-creating-20th-century-jewish-meditation/"> for Kabbalah see  Part IV&nbsp;</a><a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2018/10/15/rabbi-aryeh-kaplans-god/"> Part V&nbsp;</a> and <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2018/10/23/rabbi-aryeh-kaplan-on-experience-consciousness-and-method/">Part VI </a> Much of the prior biographic discussion has already been incorporated into Wikipedia. </p>

<p>Aryeh Kaplan’s <em>Handbook of Jewish Thought</em> has become a classic of synthesizing the classic positions of Jewish thought into an order fashion both an introductory guide and simultaneously a reference book </p>



<p>Below is a pdf of a full chapter of Aryeh Kaplan’s <em>Handbook of Jewish Thought</em> left out of the published work because he presents evolution as part of the basic tenets of Judaism. The already typeset chapter has an editor’s note across the top asking if the chapter is “fixable” and “true kosher”? There is also an editor’s note that dates the chapter to 1968 when Kaplan was leading a Conservative congregation in Dover NJ.</p>



<p>The <em>Handbook of Jewish Thought</em> was published in
two volumes, the first, containing 13 chapters, appeared in the author’s
lifetime in 1979. The second volume edited by Avraham Sutton, was published
posthumously in 1992. This volume has 25 chapters. While the first volume had
no introduction from the author, the second volume contains the following
statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The bulk of the present volume is from the author’s original 1967- 1969 manuscript that consisted of 40 chapters. Thirteen of these chapters were prepared for publication by Rabbi&nbsp; Kaplan himself and published in 1979 as the <em>Handbook of Jewish thought – Volume I</em>. It is clear that the remaining chapters were set aside with the thought of eventually preparing them for publication. Of these remaining chapters, 25 are presented here</p></blockquote>



<p>Despite the assertion that the first volume was called
“volume 1”, no such statement is to be found in the original <em>Handbook of
Jewish thought</em>. </p>



<p>Quick arithmetic – 13 (volume 1) and 25 (volume 2) indicates that 2 chapters of the original 40 were suppressed. In the end, they &#8211; Moznayim – or the Kaplan family concluded to leave these chapters out of the book.  Generally, the works published by Moznayim are much more circumspect than the audio recording of his lectures. Here is an extreme case. </p>



<p>Moznayim assigned people to edit Kaplan’s writings &nbsp;or tapes of his lectures who were not there at
the lectures or had left for other teachers years before. </p>



<p>I thank Rabbi Ari Kahn for providing access by sending
me the pdf of this gem. If someone has the final – 40<sup>th</sup> chapter – I
would love to see it.</p>



<p><strong>Evolution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>Kaplan is explicit in his affirmation of evolution in
this piece. </p>



<p>In the first three paragraphs, he states that the creation
account in Genesis is not literal and not science but narrated to teach the
history of Israel. He believes that new concepts in science are always being
discovered beyond the limited science known in the Biblical and rabbinical era.
&nbsp;We are, according to Kaplan, to continuously
interpret the Biblical text according to currently available knowledge. </p>



<p>Even though the explicit text is to narrate Israel’s history, nevertheless Kaplan states that the scientific knowledge is hinted at in the Masoretic text through “subtle variations”. In addition, we have traditions that aid in our discovering the scientific truth in the text. Maimonides and other medieval commentators interpreted the text based on Aristotle. Maimonides in his Guide II:29 explains how he would be willing to read texts based on current science. Similarly, Kaplan footnotes Ramchal in his commentary of the Aggadot. </p>



<p>Kaplan considers the creation of the universe as billions of years ago when there was the initial creation as the creation of matter as well as the initial creation of time/space. The creation at the start of Genesis was billions of years ago according to Kaplan, even if the Torah does not explicitly state it. </p>



<p>Kaplan explicitly rejects the 19<sup>th</sup> century Gosse
theory, a theory that the world only appears to be older because God created it
that way. Kaplan writes: “God does not mislead humans by making the world
appear older.” Many of the members of the Association of Orthodox Scientists of
his era did accept Gosse as did the Lubavitcher Rebbe. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaplan defines the creation with the date of 3761 BCE as only the date when Adam (the new being with intelligence) was created. The world itself is billions of years old and various species of men, including Neanderthals  and Homo Erectus, pre-date this created Adam.  People generally assume the creation of the world, creation of men, and creation of the intelligent descendants of Adam occurred at the same time; Kaplan differentiates these events. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"><img data-attachment-id="10987" data-permalink="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/10/24/aryeh-kaplan-on-evolution-a-missing-chapter-of-the-handbook-of-jewish-thought/losthumans1/" data-orig-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg" data-orig-size="907,510" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="losthumans1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg?w=500" src="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg?w=300" alt="" class="wp-image-10987" srcset="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg?w=600 600w, https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/losthumans1.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption>Neanderthal- Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis </figcaption></figure>



<p>The metaphoric sixth day was only when Adam was created in Divine thought as the plan for creation, not the actual date of his creation- see below on Kaplan&#8217;s acknowledging humanoids before Adam. (Berakhot 61b  Eruvin 18a)</p>



<p>Kaplan makes a general statement that the “time of creation is not essential to our thought.” He proves this from a citation in Yehuda Halevi’s  Kuzari,1:60-61” </p>



<p>Al Khazari: Does it not weaken thy belief if thou art told that the Indians have antiquities and buildings which they consider to be millions of years old?” To which the Rabbi in the dialogue answers: “The Rabbi: It would, indeed, weaken my belief had they a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found. Such a book, however, does not exist.” </p>



<p>Kaplan takes this to mean that Halevi would only be bothered if they had a form of religion accepted by the multitude with discrepancy, but not about the claim concerning civilization and ancient books. </p>



<p>Kaplan states that nature does not change so we accept radioactive dating; the method is valid to establish definitively that the world is billions of years old. In this, he rejects the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s opinion that radioactive dating is not valid because nature changes.  Kaplan has certainty that science works without caveats and if the method of radioactive dating of fossils show that they are millions of years old then they are millions of years old. They are not animals killed in the Biblical flood but creatures who lived billions of years ago.</p>



<p>In footnote number 12, Kaplan states that each of God’s years is 365,242 of ours yielding a world age of two billion years, which is not the current scientific age of 13.8 billions of years. </p>



<p>In contrast, in his later writings and talks, <a href="https://www.simpletoremember.com/faqs/Kaplan-SimpleToRemember.com.pdf">most notably his 1979 essay on evolution</a>, he comes up with a 15 billion year date for the universe based on Isaac the Blind, a date closer to the scientific view. For more on his later calculation, see Ari Kahn, <em>Explorations: In-depth Analysis of the Weekly Parashah Through the Prism</em> <em>of Rabbinic Perspective </em>(Brooklyn: Targum press, 2001).</p>



<p>In this early passage in the <em>Handbook</em> and its notes he does not cite Isaac of Acco. At this point, it seems he did not yet have a copy of Isaac of Acco or he might have had a citation but did not have the full sefer or did not fully study it yet. Isaac’s <em>Sefer Meirat Eynayim</em> was not yet published; it was published in 1974. And Isaac’s important <em>Otzar Hayyim</em> still remains in manuscript. Kaplan write that he obtained the photocopy of the manuscript of <em>Otzar Hayyim </em>in the 1970&#8217;s circa 1976. If in 1968 he did not have the manuscript yet, and he only photocopied it after he started publicly teaching Kabbalahthen he might have been relying on an older work of scholarship that cited it. Alternately, he might have been creative enough to develop the Rashi on his own to reach 2 billion. (see footnote 12 below)  </p>



<p>Kaplan explains that God did not really verbalize in
the creation of the world, rather God speaks means the impression of will upon
matter thereby giving it a new property. God speech involves modulating
creation to desired results.&nbsp; (There is
already a sense here of Kaplan’s later focus on mental acts &#8211; meditation).
Kaplan in his spiritualizing of the text successfully manages to be deeply
Maimonidean and Nahmanidean at the same time. He can cite simultaneously
Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed on how locutions such as “God spoke”, “God’s
mouth” or “God spoke to Moses” are anthropomorphic and not to be taken
literally. Simultaneously, Kaplan appeals to Ramban 1:3 in that Divine will
impressed upon the primordial matter of <em>hiyuli</em>, God is not literally speaking
but engaged in the coming to be of the lower hypostatic element, which in turn
will create the world. Kaplan foreshadows his later thought and treats kabbalah
in a non-literal manner. </p>



<p>&nbsp;(In Castilian Kabbalistic language, this would
be keter affecting hokhmah. Later Orthodox attempts to harmonize Biblical
create and science used Ramban’s concept of primordial matter in a literal
manner as an allusion to the Big Bang theory). </p>



<p>Kaplan further spiritualizes the process so the steps
of creation did not happen at the stated time, just that the prerequisites for
God’s goal was complete even though the actual goal would not manifest until
later (15:8)</p>



<p>Kaplan explains the phrase “it was good” to mean the
completion of something essential for the evolution of the universe,
destruction of prior worlds means evolution to something higher. &nbsp;The world is evolving to higher stages. The
destruction of prior world does not mean there were prior worlds just that
lower forms of this world. (15:9) (He cites Maharal Beer Hagolah 39b)</p>



<p><strong>Days of Creation</strong></p>



<p>What was the light created on the first day before the
creation of planets? For Kaplan the light on the first day is the electromagnetic
force in matter responsible for all chemical and physical properties, without
the electromagnetic force the world is chaos and void. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What was created on the second day? It was when God
set the matter of the first day into Euclidean four-dimensional space-time
matrix. (15:12). </p>



<p>On the third day, God created the gravitational force.
The “gathering of the waters” is not about swamps and sea but the “warping of
matter” and the creation of phenomena that follow non-Euclidian geometry. It
was also the physio-chemical properties of matter needed for plant life, (15:13)</p>



<p>On the fourth day, God initiated the process by which
matter would condense into galaxies, starts and planets,” which is the
completion of inorganic matter. </p>



<p>On the fifth day, God started the process by which
organic matter and life came to be. </p>



<p>On the important 6<sup>th</sup> day of creation, God
created the evolutionary potential of higher mammals and primitive man. Nothing
was actually created on the 6<sup>th</sup> day, rather the evolutionary
potential of the development of higher mammals from lower mammals was
designated. After the 6<sup>th</sup> day, God allows world to develop by itself
– without intelligent design- solely through the natural evolution. Just as the
geological evolution of crystals grow naturally over millions of years from
natural processes, so too the evolution of animals is the same way. The
unfolding properties for mammals and eventually man is in the natural order. </p>



<p>Man, known to paleontologists as later stages of homo sapiens, already had mental and physical capabilities about 25,000 years ago according to Kaplan’s scheme. (In 1979, he extends this to 100,000 years ago).</p>



<p>However, it was only 6000 years that man was given a divine soul. This was a new level of wisdom and inventiveness to allow for cultural evolution through invention, metallurgy, animal husbandry, ship sailing (15:22). Actual  paleontologists  place this Chalcolithic period, the period of new wisdom, as between 11,000 to 6000 years ago. Kaplan acknowledges that species change and that even man evolves as shown by his vestigial tail. </p>



<p>Hence, the seven days of creation are as follows:</p>



<p>Day
1 Electromagnetic force </p>



<p>Day
2 4-D space/time matrix</p>



<p>Day
3 Warping of matter, beyond Euclidian space </p>



<p>Day
4 Inorganic matter</p>



<p>Day
5 Organic matter and life</p>



<p>Day
6 Evolutionary potential of higher mammals and primitive man.</p>



<p>Kaplan explains his own method of not treating the
words literally, rather as allegories for scientific principles. Water, sky,
and light are all allegorical terms for the unfolding of the scientific cosmos
because the scientific terms were unknown in ancient times. (15:10) As he wrote
earlier in the chapter, according to Maimonides the words used as not intrinsic
but subject to interpretation and according to Nahmanides, these terms refer to
divine unfolding of the cosmos not physical objects. </p>



<p>In
many ways, Kaplan approach to science is similar to Nahmanides’ concept of
remez, in which scientific concepts are alluded to in the Torah. Both Kaplan
and Nahmanides read the allusions in the Torah to science, psychology, and powers
of the soul. </p>



<p>Nahmanides in his introduction to the Torah wrote: “God informed Moses first of the manner of the creation of heaven and earth and all their hosts… together with an account of the four forces in the lower world, minerals, vegetation, animal, and the rational soul. With regard to all of these matters Moses our teacher was apprised, and all of it was written in the Torah, explicitly or by implication.” (For more about Nahmanides, see Oded, Yisraeli, The Kabbalistic Remez and Its Status in Naḥmanides’ Commentary on the Torah. <em>The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy</em>. 24. (2016)1-30)</p>

<p>Welcome back after the holidays. Before the holidays, we discussed the new book by Miriam Feldmann Kaye and had three responses from Levi Morrow, Zohar Atkins, and Claire R. Sufrin. </p>



<p>  The interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye- here,&nbsp;</a>the first response was by&nbsp;<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/">Levi Morrow- here</a>, the second was by<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/zohar-atkins-responds-to-miriam-feldmann-kaye/"> Zohar Atkins- here</a> and the third was by <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/25/claire-e-sufrin-responds-to-miriam-feldman-kaye/">Claire R. Sufrin-here.</a>In her final word to response, Feldmann Kaye seeks to disaffirm and negate their specific comments.</p>



<p>At the end of her response, Feldmann Kaye positively affirms that we are called again to respond to the “plentiful array of intersections beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. Profound responses to these deeply philosophical questions, are well on their way, and many more rest on the horizon.” Personally, I look forward to these imminent profound responses. </p>

<h2><strong>Miriam Feldmann Kaye – Response</strong></h2>



<p>Thank
you to Prof. Brill for hosting some of the critical questions of our times.
This blog pioneers contemporary Jewish thought, encouraging new Jewish
philosophical and literary knowledge and engagement. The nature of this
particular conversation reflects a heated discussion of the array of
intersections beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. These responses
partially epitomise the ambivalence towards the term ‘postmodernism’. Although,
expressions of this stance deserve to be addressed with a deeper,
content-based, and respectful nature, of critique.&nbsp; </p>



<p>What
is apparent in this discussion typifies religious approaches towards
cutting-edge theology. In a positive sense, it also exemplifies engagement with
these ideas. The particular focus here is on my book, and an analysis of the
theologies of Rav Shagar (Rabbi Shimon Gershon Rosenberg) and Professor Tamar
Ross, but it is about a far broader picture of engagement with postmodern
thinking, drawing on the wealth of writings of other Jewish thinkers. It is
about the ability of Jewish thinking to cope with, or amalgamate, ideas from
contemporary philosophy.</p>



<p>Before
I address each response, there are two points which I stated in the interview,
that I will emphasise to avoid some of the apparent confusion:</p>



<ol><li>It is not my purpose to champion or to defend postmodernism.  This seems to be an important point to state, and to set aside some confusion. This allows us, or should have allowed us, to go beyond the debate of who is for and against; who agrees and who disagrees; who affiliates and who does not. The book addresses the ways in which, and the extents to which, ideas in postmodern discourse, are integrated into new thinking on contemporary Jewish philosophy. This includes discussions of the limitations of postmodern discourse in propounding a robust Jewish theology for today’s age.</li><li>I continue to take care not to class any of the numerous thinkers I deal with, as proponents of ’postmodernism’’. Throughout the book, I analyse Prof Ross’ and Rav Shagar’s <em>ambivalence</em> towards issues that postmodernism raises. This is not a simple zero sum game and needs to be addressed in accordance to these fine distinctions. </li></ol>



<p>Connected
or unconnected to this, the first two presented responses potentially discard a
great opportunity for a public conversation on the deeper issues at stake. </p>



<p>The
first response, written by Levi Morrow, would have had many of his issues
answered in the previous interview, which it seems was only partially related
to, as illustrated in the following ways: </p>



<p>Morrow
critiques what is plainly a philosophical analysis of Rav Shagar, stating that
“there is something fundamentally strange about trying to identify Rav Shagar
with a given philosophical stream”. </p>



<p>However,
this is precisely the way in which Jewish philosophy has functioned and
flourished for centuries: Philo and his integration of Platonic and Socratic
philosophy; Rambam’s engagement with Aristotle; Maimon and Mendelssohn’s engagement
with Enlightenment ideas; Rosenzweig, Buber and Levinas’ engagement with
phenomenology and existentialism.</p>



<p>The
consideration of future Jewish thought becomes the natural task – and the
consideration of Rav Shagar and Prof Ross as amongst these thinkers, brings to
the fore the issues of today &#8211; including Hasidut, neo-pragmatism, Kabbalah,
phenomenology, semiotics and late twentieth-century hermeneutical trends. This
is hardly ‘’strange’’. </p>



<p>What
is strange is that he states
that my book, which deals with philosophical elements of Rav Shagar’s
philosophy presents a “depiction of Rav Shagar [which] cannot serve to introduce new
readers to his theology’’.
It in fact <em>does</em>
provide readers with philosophical insights into the thought of Rav Shagar.
This simplification seems to be based on a mistaken understanding of the book
as an introduction to Rav Shagar’s life. </p>



<p>Rav
Shagar is indeed recognised for his total commitment to and deep engagement
with the national-religious Yeshiva world, from Kerem B’Yavneh, Mekor Haim, to
Bet Morasha, to Siach as his intellectual ‘’home’’. His writing is steeped in
Torah learning, and, as his works are published, presents an ever-developing
search for the mystical interpretations of religious-Zionism of Rav Kook. </p>



<p>At
the same time, Rav Shagar was also a Jewish theologian, and I invite others to
recognize him as such. His home bookshelf attests to his readings of
Wittgenstein, Althusser and others, alongside R. Shneur Zalman of Lyady. In his
later years, he was comparing the thought of Rebbe Nahman of Bratzlav with
Derrida, Barthes and Lyotard. And so, I re-state that Rav Shagar was a
theologian addressing postmodern thought at the same time as his immersion in
the Yeshiva world – the same way in which philosophers over the course of
Jewish history have also been.&nbsp; </p>



<p>This
encounter between both worlds is an important part of this discourse in its
entirety. In this case, I analyse Rav Shagar’s Lamdanut through the lens of
phenomenology. Another example is that his interpretations of Hasidut, are
analysed within the framework of the philosophy of language. </p>



<p>Neither
Morrow, nor Atkins give hardly a mention to Prof. Ross, who is critical to the
discussion, at the very least in the way that Rav Shagar’s thinking is framed.
Readers might have expected at least one informed comment of Prof. Ross as
unique in her synthesised works on Rambam, and Rav Kook which simultaneously
address the meaning of religious language, and its epistemological
significance. Neither of the first two respondents take this crucial
comparative element into account &#8211; which ultimately suggests a misunderstanding
of the thematic nature of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Unfortunately,
Morrow’s response descends into nit-picking. He finds certain footnotes – of
which there are hundreds in the book – to be ‘’unhelpful’’ and another as
‘’frustrating’’ and another as ‘’insane’’. In addition to this sort of
language, he writes about the book as “misleading’’, and certain paragraphs
which are apparently ‘’lacking’’, and ‘’absent’’. </p>



<p>His
list of referencing publication dates is weakened by his statement that my
dissertation was, over a period of time, ‘’converted by the publisher’’. Is he
unaware, or taking away from the fact that I wrote the book? The content and
style of this critique could be understood as begging the question as to what
is really bothering him about the book.&nbsp; </p>



<p>However, he completes his response by lauding my ‘’visionary theology’’. He writes that this work is ‘’excellent’’ and ‘’constructive’’ which is ‘’deeply in tune with both Jewish mysticism and the power of religious language’’. He also recommends that book ‘’call[s] for us to do much the same’’. Given his erudite readings and initial work of the translations of Rav Shagar’s work, one might have expected him to offer a more respectful response. </p>



<p>The
second response was written by Atkins. In his comments he seems to be missing
elements of the subject that were explicated in the book, and the interview, which
I’ve re-stated above. </p>



<p>Atkins’
response begins with what seems to be a description of postmodernism which he
implies forms the main argument of both my interview and book. &nbsp;He then begins to critique postmodernism, and it
becomes apparent, that he is offering a metaphor for an engagement with
postmodernism, namely my own, with this sceptical critique. He blurs the
boundaries between his criticism of postmodernism and between my writing, wherein
it is implicit that the two are inseparable. </p>



<p>Atkins
considers my use of philosophers – including Derrida, Lacan, Irigaray – as superficial
‘’name-dropping’’ and ‘’miming authority’’ – comparing it to the listing of
names of women objectified in a degrading gangster sexualised rap song. This
inappropriate comparison raises the question as to what he is really
suggesting? Is the problem that philosophers are listed together as
representative of philosophical movements? Or is he offering a critique of postmodern
literature? Or is he critiquing the ongoing misogyny in popular culture, and beyond?
This would have been an interesting, albeit, misplaced debate had it not been
for the derogatory tone – which continues far beyond this paragraph. His
response was then unsurprisingly censored by Prof Brill himself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In
a continued reading of his piece, he repeatedly implies that I am out to ‘’defend’’
postmodernism. One example of this is his critique of Derrida for whom, he
writes, “performance is the point, that there is nothing besides the rhetoric”.
Again, it is probably based on the presumption that the book is putting forward
an unapologetic defence of postmodernism. </p>



<p>He
further states that I am the ‘’expositor’’ of Prof. Ross and Rav Shagar. This
is mistaken, in the same way that a scholar of Rambam is not necessarily a
logician, and a researcher of Kierkegaard is not necessarily a Christian
existentialist. In addition to this, unexplained responses to a multifaceted
discipline are rife: “a tease’’ – with no explanation as to what this means
here; “none of the views espoused by Feldmann Kaye…”; and, ‘’none reflect a
deep phenomenological experience’’. These are simplifications of a far more
complex discourse. </p>



<p>His
call for a methodological deconstruction of postmodernism itself is engaging. I
might too have taken interest in his discussion on Heidegger and Derrida, had
he not made repeated
generalisations of my interview, making the starting point of the discussion
difficult to ascertain.</p>



<p>However, with all
of this, he is “grateful to Miriam Feldmann Kaye for introducing the question of
postmodernism into the contemporary discussion of Jewish thought and theology”.</p>



<p>In the meantime, since publication, both respondents have sent me private apologies.</p>



<p>The
third response was written by Claire R. Sufrin. It was, relatively, a more
thoughtful and engaging response &#8211; not just because it came across in a respectful
manner but because she offers important reflections. I note that she hadn’t
read my book though she does have the decency to say so.</p>



<p>In response to
Sufrin’s point on Prof. Ross as a forerunner in the religious feminist
movement, please see the introduction to my book where I determine her
ground-breaking work on feminism to be a case in point of her broader concerns
in philosophy of epistemology and revelation. </p>



<p>The
question of how new the subject, can first be answered of postmodernism as a
movement itself. In its various formations, it can be said to go back to the mid-twentieth
century, alongside, or offshoots of, and manifestations of, contemporaneous
trends. This is because postmodernism constitutes a discursive model of engagement,
way beyond &nbsp;philosophy and religion.</p>



<p>Postmodern
discourse is now appropriated in the fields of law, architecture, literature
and Political studies (even within Israel).&nbsp;
These fields engage with the questions of how far postmodern discourse
serves to reframe the very questions asked in these fields of study. Some of
the central perspectives offered by postmodernism comprise issues such as
non-binary and beyond binary theories of post-structuralism, post-colonialism,
aesthetics, gender theory as well as meta-ethics. In the realm of religion,
‘postmodern theology’ has been developed by Christian theologians for the last
two decades. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In
the introduction to my book, I suggest that the subject be approached
thematically, rather than by addressing totalised chronological movements of
‘’modernism’’ and ‘’postmodernism’’. What can be said though, is that we are at
the transition between modern and postmodern thought, reflecting the changes in
the trends with which we are surrounded. </p>



<p>I
am however intrigued by Sufrin’s question as to why the book is referred to as
new. I can think of at least ten thinkers, some based in Israel and some based
outside of Israel, who deal with aspects of postmodernism, who include Kepnes,
Handelman, Wolfson, Govrin and Ofrat. In addition to these thinkers, we also
now witness postmodern Jewish exegetical approaches to other aspects of
scholarship, such as of rabbinic literature, feminism, and so on. </p>



<p>As
a whole, we witness a glimpse into different approaches towards postmodern
ideas. We are called again to respond to the issues to hand, and to join the
substantive, heated discussion, about how Jewish thinkers respond to the
critical issues of our times – and to the plentiful array of intersections
beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. Profound responses to these
deeply philosophical questions, are well on their way, and many more rest on
the horizon. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.clairesufrin.com/">Claire E. Sufrin</a> is Associate Professor of Instruction and Assistant Director of Jewish Studies at the Crown Family Center for Jewish and Israel Studies. Her research and teaching interests include modern&nbsp;Jewish thought, religion and literature, and American Judaism. </p>



<p>Sufrin thinks that we still need to confront Lyotard because he was observing something he observed. Her comments focus in several ways on why the Orthodox focus on &#8220;pluralism of multiple religious faiths&#8221; and not &#8220;the plurality within Judaism and Jewish thought&#8221;  In addition, why describe Feldmann Kaye as the first when there are antecedents? Finally, is the definition of postmodernism used by Feldmann-Kaye focused on an Israeli Orthodox  definition.  Sufrin&#8217;s substantive comment on the treatment of Tamar Ross is the role of legal theorist Robert Cover for Ross, rather than postmodernism.  </p>



<h2><strong>Claire E. Sufrin &#8211; Response</strong>  </h2>



<p>I want to start by thanking Professor Brill for inviting me to comment on his conversation with Miriam Feldmann Kaye. His invitation and then even more so the record of the Feldmann Kaye-Brill conversation led me to order a copy of her book and to wait for it with anticipation. (It is not yet in my university’s library system.) Alas, I am still waiting at the mailbox, and the original deadline I agreed upon with Brill has come and gone. So I offer what follows below with the caveat that I am responding to the interview as well as to the comments offered by my colleagues but that I have not yet read Feldmann Kaye’s book. As a result, I intend my contribution to this forum not to be a review of Feldmann Kaye’s work so much as a list of ideas and questions that I will bring to her text when it does finally arrive.</p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>I agree that with Zohar Atkins that the term post-modernism
is inherently slippery. Especially if it refers to a “mood” rather than a
distinct movement. I appreciate the genealogy Atkins has constructed of
skepticism and other distinguishing characteristics of post-modernism. </p>



<p>He is certainly right that Lyotard’s claim that
post-modernity is the end of grand-narratives is itself a grand narrative. But
I don’t think that that structural problem should distract us from Lyotard’s
claim. We need to read Lyotard as responding to and trying to describe a change
he was seeing in the world around him. This is true even if he was himself
still struggling to leave a modernist paradigm behind him.</p>



<p>Yet, Post-modernism was a small blip on the screen of
modernity, rather than a new screen altogether. My way of measuring this is
inelegant but still must reflect something: when I was an undergraduate in the
late 90s, the term post-modernism was everywhere. One of my friends joked at
one point that she needed to take a course on the western classics in her
senior year, given all the time she’d spent deconstructing those classics in
every other class up until then. And yet, when I survey the undergraduates I
teach, they rarely have heard the term post-modernism or the name Derrida. </p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism and Judaism</strong></p>



<p>What about post-modernism makes it threatening to Judaism?
If Lyotard’s definition is right—and I generally think that it is and find it
useful in my research and teaching—then postmodernism is threatening because
Judaism is built on a grand narrative. That’s easy enough. But which sort of
pluralism (another word for “no grand narrative is allowed to reign supreme”)
is more threatening—the pluralism of multiple religious faiths? Or the
plurality within Judaism and Jewish thought? </p>



<p>Another point that may or may not be related: why do the other blog posts treat Feldmann Kaye as the first Jewish thinker to wrestle with post-modernity when the subtitle of Eugene Borowitz’s <em>Renewing the Covenant </em>(published in 1991) is “A Theology for the Postmodern Jew.” Surely there are other examples as well.  [siteowner note- think of Marc Alain Ouaknin &amp; Michal Govrin as Orthodox examples of postmodernists]</p>



<p>Borowitz, of course, wrote as a liberal Jew, a leading
figure in the Reform Movement. Does Feldmann Kaye acknowledge his book? Can
post-modernism be a starting point for conversation between liberal and
traditional Jewish theologians? If not, why is Wittgenstein a more comfortable
conversation partner than Borowitz? </p>



<p>If Levi Morrow is right and the “postmodernism” that
Feldmann Kaye has in mind is liberal individualism (something I’d suggest we
should associate with modernism, not post-modernism) and “what comes
after and/or attacks the ideas of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and his son, Rabbi
Tzvi Yehudah Kook.” This is a definition specific to a community within
Orthodoxy. </p>



<p>If Morrow is right, there are a few questions I’d like ask:
first and foremost, what is the audience of this book? If it is other Orthodox
figures—perhaps Ross herself or followers of the now-deceased Shagar—then to
interrogate her use of the term “postmodernism” seems to miss the point.</p>



<p><strong>Tamar Ross and Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>Unlike the other reviewers, I know Tamar Ross’s work fairly
well and I have a deep appreciation for what she tries to do in <em>Expanding the Palace of Torah</em>, even as I
am not sure she is entirely successful. </p>



<p>To me, the heart of Ross’s work is not her use of
Wittgenstein or others I might label “postmodern.” Rather, the importance of
her work lies in two other places. </p>



<p>One is her claim that revelation is continually unfolding, a
claim she bases on her reading of Rav Kook and prior Kabbalists and Hasidic
thinkers.</p>



<p>The other important aspect of her work is her engagement
with feminism, with other feminist Jewish theologians such as Judith Plaskow
and Rachel Adler, and with Robert Cover’s legal theory. (Disclosure: I’ve
written about Cover as a source of feminist theology elsewhere.) There is a
real struggle in this book to find a way for feminism and Orthodoxy to somehow
make sense together. Like Adler, Ross takes feminist Jewish theology to the
next level of complexity and intellectual integrity, beyond earlier works by
Judith Plaskow and Blu Greenberg, which were more focused on disrupting the
status quo and highlighting the exclusion of women from Jewish history,
thought, and community (if not more).</p>



<p>Is Ross postmodern? It’s not a term I would have applied to her; if Morrow is correct about the definition that Feldmann Kaye is assuming, then it applies to her insofar as she is an interpreter of Kook. But what does that get us? Perhaps Feldman Kaye’s book is best understood as a book about Kook’s legacy; but that does not appear from the interview to be the way in which she understands it. I look forward to reading the text and deciding for myself. I am grateful already to Feldmann Kaye, however, for engaging with Ross and giving her work the attention it deserves. To all those who have participated in the formal conversation on this blog and in other fora such as Brill’s facebook page by saying “I have not read Ross but…” I hope that this will lead you to pick up her book and take its claims quite seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is the second response the interview with <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye- here, </a>the first response was by <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/">Levi Morrow- here. </a></p>



<p>Rabbi Dr. Zohar Atkins  (<a href="https://www.thelehrhaus.com/author/zoharatkins/">here </a>and <a href="https://hartman.org.il/Faculty_View.asp?faculty_id=301&amp;Cat_Id=333&amp;Cat_Type=About">here</a>) is the founder of Etz Hasadeh and a Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America. He holds a DPhil in Theology from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and semikha from JTS. He is the author of a philosophic work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theological-Appropriation-Heideggers-Critique-Modernity/dp/3319969161">An Ethical and Theological Appropriation of Heidegger’s Critique of Modernity </a>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) and a book of poetry <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nineveh-Zohar-Atkins/dp/1784107395/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1569284600&amp;sr=1-1">Nineveh (Carcanet, 2019</a>). He is the author of a weekly d&#8217;var Torah newsletter: tinyletter.com/etzhasadeh</p>



<p><a href="http://kenissa.org/national-gatherings/national-consultations/2019-national-consultation/building-communities-2019/">His organization <em>Etz Hasadeh</em>&nbsp;</a> is both an emergent community oriented around the existential study of Jewish texts, philosophy, and poetry, and a lab for rethinking the field of Jewish education writ large. We promote the development of personalized, psychologically inflected, existential meaning-making skills. Etz Hasadeh offers an intervention in the way Tanakah and Rabbinic literature are taught and studied, clearing the way for a ​<em>poetic&nbsp;</em>​approach to learning that empowers students to engage ancient images and ideas as metaphors for the challenges of contemporary life.</p>



<p>In this response essay, Zohar Atkins has several points.
First, and easiest to grasp, is that the term postmodernism is difficult to
define and may ultimately be more of a mood than a theory. Second, and more
substantively, Torah is about continuity, tradition, mesorah, and grounded
readings, not skepticism and the limits of knowledge. Therefore, to Atkin’s ear
much of the discussion of consensus, self-acceptance, and progressive
revelation sound like 19<sup>th</sup> century opinions of the followers of Zechariah
Frankel. </p>



<p>Third, postmodernism is clearly not Existentialism,
and Franz Rosenzweig already rejected the early 20<sup>th</sup> century idea of
living “as if” as inauthentic. Fourth, he finds problems with Feldmann-Kaye’s
use of Heidegger who rejected humanism and instead sought an opening to truth,
an unconcealing of Being allowing us to think. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Atkins does try to explain the use of postmodernism as
a way of saying “God wants us to be incapable of finding God. Postmodernism is
just another name for&nbsp;<em>Galut Edom</em>, the Roman Exile.” Yet, he
concludes that: “these flights of poetic fancy are not postmodern, they are
fundamentalist, mythic.” For Atkins, postmodernism has to treat every myth as
an idol. Atkins defines the task of the contemporary religious philosopher to
live “shuttling back and forth” with “an agon with myth for philosophy and an
agon with philosophy for myth. Postmodern theology, thus, is a relishing of
myth and a relishing of demythologization, yet it is an endeavor that, to me,
seems like it can only be idiosyncratic, and a source of great dissonance.”</p>



<p>Finally, Atkins considers thinking “a form of&nbsp;<em>avodah,&nbsp;</em>is a holy, religious task” in which engagement with postmodern thought is necessary. He appreciated the “effort to amplify and beatify Torah (<em>yagdil Torah v’adir</em>),” by placing “it in conversation with the wisdom and insights of other traditions,” in this case postmodernism. &nbsp;He is deeply committed to the horizons of our lived Torah. For him, “Torah should speak to everything we know, love, and experience.”</p>

<h2><strong>Concerning Postmodernism and Jewish Thought-Zohar Atkins<br /></strong></h2>



<p><strong>Defining Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>Postmodernism is notoriously—though perhaps appropriately—difficult to define.<br /> Is it a school of thought? A literary style propounded by a set of thinkers, writers, artists (often French)? A worldview rooted in skepticism so radical it always becomes its own object of critique? An aesthetic that fuses avant-garde and pop, a la Andy Warhol, Frank O’Hara, John Cage, and Lady Gaga? A historical epoch dating to 1968? A fancy or pretentious synonym for <em>contemporary? </em>A way of saying <em>modernism mamash </em> (<em>really</em> modernism)? </p>



<p><br />
If postmodernism is defined as an aversion to fixed labels and determinacy, is
there any purchase to the term—<em>l’shitato—</em>according to its own standards,
or is it a self-cancelling term, like a witness who comes before a court and
says, “I am an unreliable witness”? Perhaps it is impossible to write about
postmodernism; “one cannot look upon its face and live.”</p>



<p><br /> If I were postmodern, I cannot be said to have an identity; rather identity is something I perform. There is no self, just presentation. To be a subject is to be a prisoner of the social order; my name-dropping does not actually refer to thinkers out there in the world, but only to the act of citation itself, a gesture, a miming of authority. In this sense, the string of proper names, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, is no different than those found in, say, a song with many names in the lyrics.</p>



<p>One reason for the confusion is that one of
postmodernism’s chief proponents, Jean Francois Lyotard, defined
(paradoxically) the postmodern condition as the end of “grand narratives.” Yet
in so doing, Lyotard set up his own grand narrative, in which modernism was
said to be naive and postmodernism was presented as the end of history. In this
way, postmodernism’s self-representation is no different than the bombastic
pronouncements of Nietzsche’s Zarathustra or Hegel’s Absolute Spirit; I suppose
the main difference is the way in which these earlier iterations still aspired
at some ideal, whereas postmodernism aspired to pursue with one hand what it
took away with the other.</p>



<p>If Derrida has become a poster child for
postmodernism, then perhaps what distinguishes postmodern thought from its
critical antecedents is less its content than its mood, the mood of
disenchantment, levity, comedy, neurosis, anti-messianism; or as Derrida put it
“messianism without messianicity.”</p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism and Judaism&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the Roman Emperor
Vespasian for a yeshiva in Yavneh (Gittin 56b) he exchanged politically doomed
Temple-based Judaism for a new paradigm of Jewish life. Sometimes postmodernism
is presented in this way.</p>



<p>Yet if rabbinic Judaism saw itself as continuous with
its historical past, and still, at times, looked nostalgically to the figure of
the Temple in its fantasies, postmodernists emphasized and venerated&nbsp;<em>rupture</em>,
as implied in their prefix “post-”. Never mind that the slogan of literary
modernism was “make it new” (<a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/the-making-of-making-it-new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezra
Pound, translating an ancient Confucian sage</a>); never mind that montage and
irony and indeterminacy and ambiguity were already important conceits before
postmodernism became a cultural shibboleth. Never mind that skepticism is an
ancient tradition, that subjectivism took off with Descartes, that pragmatism
was a Neo-Kantian idea already popularized by William James in the 19th century,
or that the so-called “linguistic turn” can be traced to Wittgenstein, a
modernist, if not earlier to Herder, Schlegel, and the romantic movement?</p>



<p>The ubiquity and unclarity of the term&nbsp;<em>postmodern</em>&nbsp;means
that it often does more harm than help when appended to another term such as
“Jewish thought” or “Jewish theology.” Does postmodern Jewish thought mean
thought that is influenced by postmodern thinkers, thought that simply occurs
in a historic period known as postmodern, or thought that is treated by critics
as having the worst signature features of postmodern writing, namely,
convolution, sophistry, relativism, a “retreat from judgment” (Arendt), etc.?
The term is so contested that it is probably better just to say what one means
than make appeal to this proper name; though one thing shared by postmoderns
through their debt to Quintillian, Schlegel, and Kierkegaard, is that it is
impossible to say what one means; to think we can is to commit the “intentional
fallacy.” “There is nothing outside the text” (Derrida). </p>



<p>Even here, though, postmodern analysis proves no
different than its modernist antecedents; for whether the analysis is
structuralist or post-structuralist, Freudian or Foucauldian, the point is that
the interpreter, and not the text itself, holds the key to its interpretation.
In some ways this posture is quite compatible with a certain understanding of
oral Torah, whereby the meaning of the written Torah falls to the rabbis rather
than, say, the karaites, historians, or philologists. At the same time, the
sages of the Talmud still sought to ground their arguments in a reading of
verses from the Written Torah, and subsequently, in the precedent readings of
earlier sages.</p>



<p>I am not an expert in the thought of Tamar Ross or Rav
Shagar, yet I am a great admirer of anyone who, in an effort to amplify and
beatify Torah (<em>yagdil Torah v’adir</em>), places it in conversation with the
wisdom and insights of other traditions; Torah should speak to everything we
know, love, and experience. And even if Western thought is a kind of Exile, we
should take comfort in knowing that “the divine presence goes into Exile with
us.” Whether Ross, Shagar, and their expositor, Miriam Feldmann Kaye, succeed
or fail, we should applaud their effort at&nbsp;<em>kiddush hashem,&nbsp;</em>of
sanctifying (the Jewish) God. They follow the example of Maimonides, who said
that if Aristotle’s thought were true, the Torah would have to be read in light
of Aristotelian philosophy, and whose thought was, for a time, accused of being
heretical until it became a dominant school of Jewish thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The irony and self-contradiction of a postmodern
Torah, however, is the way in which it challenges the commonsense view of
truth. How can the critique of truth itself be true? What is meant by “truth”?</p>



<p>Reading Feldmann Kaye’s interview, my impression is
that she/Ross regards postmodernism in a positive light as the doctrine that
truth is decided through intersubjective agreement. To me, though, that’s not
postmodernism at all, but positivism, and I don’t see how it’s much different
than the historicist view established by the Conservative movement in the 19th
century. Perhaps the fundamental claim that revelation is ongoing, is
culturally rooted, is emergent, is not different in kind, but only in degree,
from the ideas of Zechariah Frankel. Majority rules is not postmodern, its just
liberal.&nbsp;<em>Minhag yisrael halachah hi&nbsp;</em>(the customs of Israel are
legally binding)—is no different than&nbsp;<em>Vox populi Vox Dei&nbsp;</em>or
Rousseau’s theory of the general will. We find the norm of law by consensus in
the Talmud; but law is not truth; and saying there are many truths a la
postmodernism is different than saying we can’t know the one truth; the former
is an ontological claim, while the later is an epistemological one.</p>



<p>For non-specialists for whom the above sounds rather
dense, let’s just put it this way, Franz Rosenzweig criticizes the view that
truth is decided by human will as “as if thinking,” a form of theological
hedging whereby the non-believer says that the only way to live a good life is
to act&nbsp;<em>as if&nbsp;</em>God exists. If postmodern Jewish theology is “as
if” thinking, is Pascal’s wager 2.0, I find it weak. If postmodern theology
just means existentialist religiosity, it’s both hardly new, and hardly
radical. Kierkegaard and Rebbe Nachman share the view that one cannot have
certain knowledge of anything, yet this self-skepticism becomes a tool for
motivating a leap of faith that, unsurprisingly, is outwardly quite submissive
to dogma and the protocols of religious observance. The only thing that
distinguishes a religious existentialist and a regular&nbsp;<em>eved hashem</em>&nbsp;is
the existentialist’s emphasis on&nbsp;<em>interiority</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Non-Foundationalism&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye invokes non-foundationalism as a
hallmark of both postmodern thought and postmodern Jewish thought, yet ends up
defining it in a foundationalist way as the agreement of people on what the
truth is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Heidegger, truth is “unconcealment,” not social
reality, which he sometimes derides as “hearsay” in&nbsp;<em>Being and
Time,&nbsp;</em>nor is truth some kind of individual experience a la the
romantics. Meanwhile, for Nietzsche, truth is perspectival, yet it is the task
of strong artists and thinkers to will their truth into existence by exercising
a will to power; consensus is for the herd of half-dead unoriginals who are
still too bound up with “slave morality,” whether they be religious
fundamentalists or bourgeois secularists (or, as we now see in our day, bourgeois,
religious fundamentalists). Heidegger is a non-foundationalist insofar as he
rejects systematic thought based on first principles, yet the reason for this
rejection is not because he is skeptic, but because he believes foundationalism
is ontologically impoverished, does not enable us to properly think, and
therefore, flourish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If non-foundationalism means we keep the Torah “simply
because” we are thrown into a heritage, rather than because we have good
rational reasons and justifications that can withstand critical (Western)
enquiry, this is a kind of honest, modest, and yet Rube-Goldbergish way of
utilizing academic thinkers to basically follow in the footsteps of Rebbe
Nachman’s simpleton (see the story “chacham and tam”). It’s good therapy for
people who are born into a thick knowledge of and commitment to Jewish life,
but it is unlikely to win any one over; perhaps this is its virtue—it’s
anti-patronizing, nice, polite pc liberalism. I happen to be a slave to God and
you happen not to be, but, hey, these are both just lifestyles we inherited
from our families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you believe that God revealed&nbsp;<em>everything&nbsp;</em>to
Moses, all the oral law, and all the principles for expounding it, it is very
difficult to make sense of the story in Menachot 29b in which Moses sits,
confused, in the back of R. Akiva’s classroom. If Rabbi Akiva is so great,
Moses asks, why wasn’t the Torah given to him? “Be quiet. Such did it come to
me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One might be tempted to ask, similarly, why God did
not reveal postmodern thought to Moses; why did God wait for our generation to
reveal postmodern philosophy? To ask such a question, though, is to go crazy,
for it is the kind of question that postmodern thought forbids asking with a
straight face (it is somehow less absurd to ask why God waited to reveal
relativity theory to Einstein).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, if we translate it into metaphysical terms, we can say that God wants us to be incapable of finding God. Postmodernism is just another name for&nbsp;<em>Galut Edom</em>, the Roman Exile. But these flights of poetic fancy are not postmodern, they are fundamentalist, mythic. Postmodernism is monotheistic insofar as it treats every myth as an idol, even the myths of Sinai and the myths of an unbroken&nbsp;<em>mesorah</em>. My shuttling back and forth represents not postmodern theology, but an agon with myth for philosophy and an agon with philosophy for myth. Philosophy<a> </a>sought to defang myth; religion is the submission to it. To be a religious philosopher is to defang and submit at once, to make a myth of defanging while defanging it. Postmodern theology, thus, is a relishing of myth and a relishing of demythologization, yet it is an endeavor that, to me, seems like it can only be idiosyncratic, and a source of great dissonance. If I were an amora, I would suggest that this dissonance is divinely prescribed, that philosophy corresponds to the first set of (broken) tablets and myth to the second (whole) set, both of which were kept in the ark together. And if I were an amora (playing Abaye to my own Rava) I would counter, and say the first set refers to myth while the second set refers to philosophy. Teiku.</p>



<p><strong>Use of Heidegger and Derrida in the
Interview&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye’s invocation of Heidegger is a tease;
little besides the name Heidegger is given to us that suggests what a
Heideggerian approach to revelation could involve, but even if there were, it
is arguable whether Heidegger can be called postmodern. He is certainly viewed
that way, negatively by Allan Bloom and positively by Richard Rorty. I have no
doubt that Heidegger has much to contribute to contemporary Jewish life and
thought, but none of the views espoused by Feldmann Kaye in the name of Shagar
and Ross fit Heidegger’s thought too well, and none reflect a deep
phenomenological influence; the value of cultural particularism is not unique
to Heidegger and Heidegger would have eviscerated terms like “culture” and
“experience” as remaining caught in a retrograde metaphysics of “humanism.”</p>



<p>When you compare Derrida to Heidegger, besides the
linguistic and political differences, you find a tonal difference. Heidegger’s
mood is heroic, tragic, messianic; Derrida’s is playful, jestful, cerebral.
Heidegger and Derrida are both gnomic writers; yet one senses with Heidegger
that he has something serious to say; with Derrida, one senses that the
performance is the point, that there is nothing besides the rhetoric. In
Heidegger, rhetoric serves the purpose of thought. In Derrida, one feels, there
is nothing besides rhetoric. Derrida scholars can disagree; Heidegger reads as
a reluctant spiritual Master, as a thinker. Derrida reads as a comedian, as
Aristophanes to Heidegger’s Socrates, which isn’t to say Derrida isn’t serious
or that there isn’t a seriousness to his jocularity, or that he doesn’t have
something to say. Still, one never feels levity reading terms like&nbsp;<em>Seinsfrage,
Geworfenheit</em>,&nbsp;<em>Erschlossenheit</em>,&nbsp;<em>die Frage nach dem
Technik</em>; meanwhile, Derrida’s essays seem haughtily pitched to deflate
everything of its gravity, as if any form of seriousness were somehow in danger
of becoming an instrument of fascism. One can certainly make the argument that
Heidegger is postmodern or else presages postmodern thought, yet his
aesthetic—even when playful, even when self-questioning—has a devotional
quality to it. We should consider whether postmodern Jewish thought and life
require us to be jesters in the Derridean mold or pietist in the Heideggerian
one. In the end, the issue of postmodernism might be one of tone and aesthetics
more than content (after all, postmodernism can also be framed as a privileging
of form and frame over content, e.g., “the medium is the message.”)</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For those of us who aspire to think, who believe it is of the utmost import, and who, as Jews, or as religious folk, believe that thinking is a form of&nbsp;<em>avodah,&nbsp;</em>is a holy, religious task, engagement with postmodern thought is necessary. It may be necessary even as a Jacob’s ladder we climb and then kick away. I don’t believe postmodern thought often succeeds in “thinking,” yet I believe it helps us spot the ways in which we are not yet thinking, and this humility is needed today, not just for ethical and political reasons, but also for spiritual ones. To know that one is not yet thinking, is this not&nbsp;<em>the awe of heaven?</em></p>



<p>I am grateful to Miriam Feldmann Kaye for introducing the question of postmodernism into the contemporary discussion of Jewish thought and theology, not because I believe postmodernism can save Jewish life or thought (I’m not sure any doctrine, even an anti-doctrinaire one could do this), but because the question of how to live a sincere, elevated, responsible, pious Jewish life that is critical, self-critical, and open-minded, is upon us.</p>

<p>This is the first in a sequence of responses to the interview with <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye about her book  <em>Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age</em></a><em>.</em> The second response is by Zohar Atkins- here. </p>



<p>The review deals with Feldmann-Kaye’s use of the writings of Rav Shagar. Morrow is pursuing a graduate degree on the writings of Rav Shagar so he has the passion of a graduate student in his vigorous comments. He rejects the ridged division of Rav Shagar into periods (such as “traditional,” “existentialist,” and “postmodern,”  Yet he still works with the division to note that an early homily based on the Maharal should not be used as postmodern, and to note that Rav Shagar has explicit Existential essays in the spirit of Sartre. Morrow points out how the book needed to update its 2002 references since the majority of the writing were published since that date. Finally, Morrow returns us the Israeli sociological meaning of postmodern as post Rav Kook’s religious national project in order to point out that Rav Shagar himself remained in the Yeshiva, taught Torah and was not aiming to be a postmodern, even when he read those works. </p>



<p>Levi Morrow is a Masters student at Tel Aviv University, and is writing his thesis on Rav Shagar and Franz Rosenzweig. He has translated a forthcoming book of Rav Shagar&#8217;s holiday derashot, as well as many of the teachings and poems of Rav Shagar&#8217;s friend and colleague Rav Menachem Froman. Levi teaches Jewish Philosophy in Jerusalem, where he lives with his wife and two daughters.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> A Postmodern Theology from the Writings of Rav Shagar? </strong></p>



<p>Dr. Miriam
Feldmann Kaye’s <em>Jewish Theology for a
Postmodern Age</em> focuses primarily on Rav Shagar and Dr. Tamar Ross. Is it
meant to introduce their respective theologies to the reader as examples of
postmodern Jewish theology? Or is it meant to use them as resources for the
author and readers’ own theologies? A close reading of the book indicates that
the latter is more correct, that constructive theology takes precedence to
historical scholarship. </p>



<p><strong>Understanding Rav
Shagar’s Context</strong></p>



<p>I
can’t speak to the depiction of Ross’s theology, but the depiction of Rav
Shagar cannot serve to introduce new readers to his theology. The focus on
Postmodernism renders it at best partial, and in some cases actually misleading
in understanding the thought of Rav Shagar. A few examples will suffice.</p>



<p>In
discussing the idea of cultural particularism and the historical conditioning
of the subject, Feldmann Kaye quotes from Shagar’s <em>Panekha Avakesh</em>, a collection of derashot on the parashah from when
he was interim Rosh Yeshivah of Yeshivat Hakotel in 1982-83. Feldmann Kaye
states:</p>



<p>Shagar’s conception of cultural
particularism relies on a forceful alienation and negation of the self, which
leads to an all-encompassing awareness of the influence of one’s surroundings. <em>He acknowledges the strong parallels between
postmodernism and hasidic introspection</em>&#8230; With the self utterly nullified,
the individual is no longer subject to delusions. She can look into herself as
if she were a perfect limpid vessel and finally appreciate who she is and,
indeed, <em>the extent to which her identity
and character are the result of a host of conditioning factors. </em>(<em>JTPA</em>, 34; emphasis added)</p>



<p>However, the text
she references doesn’t mention Postmodernism or Hasidism, and misses the source
of the self-negation in the writings of the Maharal. Rav Shagar stresses the
importance of negating the active, egoistic self, as well as purifying the self
from urges and desires, in favor of a return to the “source” and “root” of the
person, which enables recognition of divine truth (<em>Panekha Avakesh</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pUwjbadCE0_e5fY_LSE0YpA8nIAktgTp">62-63</a>). There are many types of
self-negation, and in some places Rav Shagar does connect it to the historical
conditioning of individual identity and character (see, for example, <em>Luhot U’shivrei Luhot</em>, 52). Here,
however, he’s talking about a pious duty to cleanse the self of desires and of
ego in order to connect to a person’s divine source and gain a divine
understanding of truth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I’m not of the opinion that his thought can be
neatly divided into periods (such as “traditional,” “existentialist,” and
“postmodern,” as I’ve heard suggested), but there’s clearly some truth to it.
His early texts (and <em>Panekha Avakesh</em>
is the earliest of his published teachings!) simply don’t reflect postmodern
themes and ideas, which would make some sense as he doesn’t seem to have read
them yet. Some of the same concerns may exist throughout, but the changing
forms these concerns take is important. Rav Shagar talks about negation of the
self, <em>bittul</em>, from his earliest texts
to his latest. In the former, this means humility, purification of the self,
and connection to the source. In the latter, it means recognizing the divine
nature of the self exactly as it is (<em>Luhot
U’shivrei Luhot</em>, 419).</p>



<p><strong>Sartre and
Existentialism </strong></p>



<p>Another
example of the value of a closer reading arises in a discussion of freedom. Feldmann
Kaye discusses an essay called “Freedom and Holiness” from the book <em>Kelim Shevurim</em> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RgzSiCDWQXJ1UC_4faJXgbtN7PpMZKN6">a lightly edited
version</a>
appears in the later <em>Luhot U’shivrei
Luhot</em>, and it was translated into English in <em>Faith Shattered and Restored</em>), and remarks that </p>



<p>Shagar guides his readers away from
the existentialist idea of freedom as individual autonomy. He takes Jean-Paul
Sartre to task by arguing that his understanding of the concept leads
inevitably to nihilism or fatalism&#8230; Shagar takes exception to Sartre’s
understanding of the self. The latter lays the burden of freedom on the
individual, placing on her shoulders the onus to choose her own essence and
thereby devise the ‘project’ that is her existence. Sartre saw the self as the
sole arbiter of values. Shagar, however, criticizes such a conception of
freedom on the basis that it leads to anarchy, and proposes instead to shift
the burden for formulating truth claims onto the community&#8230; he qualifies his
own version as ‘mystical freedom,’ that is, an inspired freedom derived from
‘the unity of the human and the divine’ which enables the community of Israel
to shape its own set of truths <em>ex nihilo</em>
(or in mystical terms as <em>yesh me’ayin</em>).
(<em>JTPA</em>, 40-41)</p>



<p>The
problem here is that Rav Shagar is actually aiming at a version of freedom
closer to Sartre than to any other thinker he mentions, a “Sartre Plus” model
rather than a rejection of Sartre (this is eminently clear from the essay, but
also from similar texts such as Passover derashot on freedom in <em>Zeman Shel Herut</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RfxXvVPFJXufzfdecy7mqo-6jKL5Q5XD">163-168</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16tHNbowy0mitNJRxwwAv93Cz6B4uNmWd">169-178</a>, and an essay on the self in <em>Nahalekh Baragesh</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzQYdQcngakSdG5jYzhNQlpCSnhZbUx2RlZjV1A4UDhybkNr">139-146</a>). In the essay, Rav Shagar
catalogues models of freedom, including that of the Tanakh, the Rambam, Rav
Kook, and Sartre. Of all of them, Sartre is the only one who believes that
freedom means the ability to create values, and this is what Rav Shagar wants
to embrace. </p>



<p>Rav
Shagar’s problem with Sartre is that Sartre, he says, thinks human creations
can never be meaningful because they can never transcend their creator and gain
a sense of absoluteness, meaning that a person can never commit to values that
she herself created. He solves this by paradoxically identifying human creation
with divine revelation. After a person creates their own values, they should
paradoxically see them as divine values to which they must commit. Living a
life of “covenant” (“<em>berit</em>”), Rav
Shagar says, means seeing our freely-made choices as inevitabilities, like a
person seeing their freely-chosen spouse as the only person they could possibly
have married. This is Rav Shagar’s “Sartre-Plus” model of freedom.</p>



<p>Moreover, the emphasis on community
that Feldmann Kaye sees in the essay is almost entirely lacking. The discussion
of the concept of freedom in Tanakh mentions that the “subject” with whose
freedom Tanakh is concerned is the nation, not the individual, and I can see
Feldmann Kaye could construe that toward a postmodern cultural particularism.
However, that concept is nowhere to be found in the section on “mystical
freedom,” or the passages on Rambam or Rav Kook, for that matter. The emphasis
is on the individual and her ability to make creative choices, and the essay
concludes with a discussion of how modern man (<em>ha’adam ha’akhshavi</em>, which if I would most accurately translate as
“the contemporary individual,” but that begs my conclusion) possesses an image of
God on the level of <em>ayin</em>,
nothingness, a liberating non-essentialism that allows them the ability to
create <em>ex nihilo.</em> </p>



<p><strong>Updating the References
</strong></p>



<p>On
a more technical note, I want to briefly address the issue of references. <em>JTPA</em> is a revised version of Feldmann
Kaye’s 2012 PhD dissertation, and it has been excellently converted by the publisher
into a more popularly accessible book. One area that did not receive enough
attention in the intervening years, however, was the references to Rav Shagar’s
writings. Many volumes of his writings have been published since then, and
referencing (nevermind quoting) them would certainly have enriched the book,
but they are almost entirely absent (with the exception of <em>She’erit Ha’emunah</em>). Just to give one example, her discussions of
both cultural particularlism and linguistic determinism would be greatly
enhanced by Rav Shagar’s Hanukkah derashah “Religious Life in the Modern Age,” <em>Faith Shattered and Restored</em>,” 41-65,
published in Hebrew as “<em>Halakhah,
Halikhah, Ve’emunah</em>,” <em>Le’ha’ir Et
HaPetahim</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzQYdQcngakSaDgzREZxY0NJd1E">158-186</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, many of the references
may have made sense in 2012, but the publishing since then has made them
confusing. For example, there are references to “<em>Broken Vessels</em>, vol. 2,” a non-existent second volume of <em>Kelim Shevurim</em>. For someone well versed
in the editors’ footnotes to Rav Shagar’s writings from before it was published
in 2013, this is clearly <em>Luhot U’Shivrei
Luhot</em>, which the editors sometimes referenced as a forthcoming, expanded,
second edition of <em>Kelim Shevurim</em>.
However, for anyone not so versed, the reference is unhelpful (this also means
that the correct pagination could have been tracked down, and wasn’t).
Similarly, there is the essay “My Faith” which has been published twice, in
Hebrew and English (<em>Luhot U’Shivrei Luhot</em>,
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eA5DWzht-tK4rAOLg5hbrnykxQdxM7GK">407-426</a><em>;
Faith Shattered and Restored</em>,
21-39), but which in 2012 was an unpublished file available only to those in
the know. Feldmann Kaye’s reference to the text demonstrates just how thorough
her PhD was, but the lack of an updated reference, referring to either of the
essay’s two versions, is frustrating. </p>



<p><strong>Is Rav Shagar a
Postmodern?</strong></p>



<p>By
way of conclusion, I would return to more substantive issues Is Rav Shagar a
Postmodernist, or a thinker who deals with Postmodernity? ( cf. <em>JTPA</em>, 35) He is certainly the latter;
perhaps he is sometimes the former, but he is also so much more than that. It
is a shame that so much of the discussion about him revolves solely around his
interest in Postmodernism. He was a constructive
theologian as a Rosh Yeshiva, deeply in tune with the cultural and religious
shifts his community was undergoing, and he marshalled the best of the Jewish
tradition and his readings of non-Jewish philosophy to respond appropriately.</p>



<p>As with the first example in this review based on the Maharal, there are of &nbsp;many more postmodern counterexamples from Rav Shagar’s writings. In one text, he explicitly denies the ability of a person to create <em>ex nihilo</em>, instead celebrating the bricolage of creating something new out of something else (See <em>She’erit Ha’emunah</em>, 24). But that itself is exactly the point. There is so much in the writings of Rav Shagar, which are quite rich and full of theological explorations, that make it reductionist to consider them only from a postmodern perspective. Rav Shagar was a born-and-raised Kookian Religious Zionist, a Post-Kookian Religious Zionist, a brilliant talmudist, a driving force in Religious Zionism’s Hasidic revolution, an existentialist, and yes, a postmodernist as well. Appreciating all of the different voices that emerge from his writings requires care and precision, something I find somewhat lacking in <em>Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age</em>. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the matter of
Postmodernism quickly becomes a question of what we, and Rav Shagar, mean by
it. Tomer Persico and Alan Brill <a href="https://7minim.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/pomo/">have &nbsp;shown</a>
how Religious Zionist opponents of “Postmodernism” and Rav Shagar himself
define postmodernism as liberal individualism. For all of them, “Postmodernism”
is what comes after and/or attacks the ideas of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and
his son, Rabbi Tzvi Yehudah Kook, a category that can include a lot more than
what people typically call “Postmodernism” such as Buber, Sartre, and Rav Nachman.
</p>



<p>It’s not incidental that Rav Shagar’s
“postmodernism” is shaped by his Jewish theological context. He spent his whole
life in the yeshivah system, never attending university, and was not shy about
his unfaithful, ahistorical readings of secular philosophical texts: “We aren’t committed to ‘scientific,’ faithful-to-the-original,
readings of Western or Eastern philosophy” (<em>Luhot
U’Shivrei Luhot</em>, 132-133).</p>



<p>On some level, there’s something
fundamentally strange about trying to identify Rav Shagar with a given
philosophical stream, while he was so self-conscious and explicit about
appropriating a variety of such streams for his own theological ends.
Understanding Rav Shagar requires paying close attention not to his
affiliations but to his appropriations, the way his readings of non-Jewish
texts constructively shape both those texts and his understanding of Judaism,
“the external light and the internal vessel.”(ibid.).</p>



<p><em>JTPA</em> is an excellent constructive work,
one that attempts to delineate specifically postmodern issues for theology, and
then proposes methods for dealing with them through readings of Rav Shagar and
Dr. Ross. Feldmann Kaye’s call for a “visionary theology,” one deeply in tune
with both Jewish mysticism and the power of religious language, is a call for
us to do much the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Anthony Giddens, the world-renowned sociologist divides Western modernity into three periods, the enlightenment, modernism, and late modernity. The Enlightenment as the first form of modernity, characterized by the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries’ attempt to turn towards literacy, reason, science, and autonomy, as well as the fight against the old regime and traditionalism. Modernism, the second form of modernity, is the enthusiastic embrace of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries’ turn to urbanization, individuality, and new understandings of humanity and society. The goal was to cultivate a religion that grapples with modernist challenges and accounts for individuality. Modernist expert knowledge— such as science or the university— during this period was authoritative. Late modernity, the third form of modernity, was a loss of trust in the expert authority of modernity, which resulted in the emergence of multiple forms of authority while also embracing the new materialism and post-secularism. We are in the later age. Some who emphasize philosophy and theory call this period last period postmodernism, a period that sees the limits of modernism. and its universal visions. </p>



<p>Among those using this philosophic language is the recent book by Miriam Feldmann Kaye, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Theology-Postmodern-Cultural-Studies/dp/1906764689">Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age </a></em>( Liverpool University Press in association with&nbsp; Library of Jewish Civilization, 2019), a short but smart book encouraging us to simultaneously expand our horizons and those of contemporary Jewish theology. Miriam Feldmann Kaye, a recipient of&nbsp;the Cambridge Theological Studies Prize,&nbsp;holds a BA from Cambridge University, MA from the&nbsp;University of London, and PhD in Jewish History from Haifa University.&nbsp; She is currently a Teaching Fellow at Bar Ilan University.  She recently completed a Lady Davis Post-Doctoral Fellowship, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She also teaches in the MA program for Jewish Education at the School of Education, the Hebrew University.&nbsp;She is Founding Director of the Israel branch of the Faith and Belief Forum (formerly the Three Faiths Forum).</p>

<p>Feldmann Kaye’s book seeks to make philosophy and theological meaning from the writings of Rabbi Shagar and Prof Tamar Ross. She seeks to rescue them from sociological explanations grounded in changes in Israeli culture, and instead, sees them as directions for Jewish thought in the post-modern age, postmodern in the broad sense of general philosophic trend after modernity.  </p>



<p>

The blog hosted a number of responses to the interview with Miriam Feldmann-Kaye. The first is by Levi Morrow on <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/">her use of Rav Shagar- here </a> The second response is by<a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/zohar-atkins-responds-to-miriam-feldmann-kaye/"> Zohar Atkins on her postmodernism -here.</a></p>



<p>[For interested in Tamar Ross’ ideas <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/interview-with-prof-tamar-ross-on-revelation-round-two/">see my interview here </a>(also <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/prof-tamar-ross-on-revelation-and-biblical-criticism/">here</a> and <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/prof-tamar-ross-responds-to-the-comments/">here)</a>, for those interested in Rav Shagar, I have 19 posts- see <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/rav-shagar-and-secular-studies-on-translation-and-living-in-multiple-worlds/">here </a>and <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/prayer-without-hoping-rav-shagar/">here</a> for the end of my many posts and <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/rabbi-shagar-values-and-faith-in-the-postmodern-age/">here </a>and <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2016/10/26/judaism-and-post-modernity-rabbi-shagar-in-english-translation/">here </a> that directly relate to his postmodernism. For those who want the sociological approach to these thinkers, see <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2016/09/17/smadar-cherlow-who-moved-my-judaism-judaism-post-modernism-and-contemporary-spirituality/">my review of Smadar Cherlow’s book here</a>.] </p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye’s method is to first present the theological tenor of the current age, followed by showing how Rabbi Shagar and Prof Ross fit into this age, then to give examples and directions for expanding these ideas. &nbsp;Feldmann Kaye is comfortable contextualizing her subjects in postmodern thinkers even if the subjects themselves have not read them.&nbsp; If Wittgenstein is important in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and her two thinkers fit into this trend of Wittgenstein, then she can offer other thinkers and ideas – such as by Paul Ricoeur, W. V. O. Quine, or Martin Heidegger- to amplify and develop the idea. &nbsp;This method would be akin to discussing the Existential Age of Buber, Sartre and Camus, then showing that Heschel and Soloveitchik should be contextualized as Existentialists, and concluding with ideas from Tillich, Maritain, or Rahner. </p>



<p>All her discussion points to Feldmann Kaye’s own &#8220;visionary theology&#8221; bursting out between the lines of the book never articulated, even with my coaxing for this interview. She has sympathy for the post-secular 21<sup>st</sup> century ideas of Richard Kearney’s anantheism and Jean Luc Marion’s saturated event.  She wants to open up to a theology &#8220;which does not rely on an ultimate and singular truth, but posits instead that the notion of a multiplicity of truths.&#8221; For Feldmann-Kaye &#8220;The implications are twofold: firstly, since faith does not lend itself to scientific verification, it becomes difficult to justify a preference for one’s own world view or way of life. Second, if such truths are perceived as culturally particular social constructs, their prime function is limited to defining communal boundaries.&#8221; &nbsp;I heard part of it at the World Congress of Jewish Studies in 2017. &nbsp;I hope to hear more. </p>



<p>The book focuses on three specific themes in their thought, (1) Cultural Particularism, (2) Language, and (3) Revelation. </p>



<p>In 1979, Lyotard published <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postmodern_Condition">The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge</a>,</em> a work acknowledging that the era of modernism and existentialism had ended. In its place, Lyotard offered skepticism about universalizing theories and a rejection of universals and metanarratives. Feldmann Kaye relies heavily on this seminal work to define the philosophic climate of our era.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">The first, cultural particularism is Feldmann Kaye’s way of saying that there are only local religious truths; no longer do thinkers have to respond to modernist universals of authority and knowledge. Rav Shagar has an approach of being at home in the study hall and one finds one’s truth in the study hall, while Prof Ross has an approach of working within the particularistic canon of Kabbalah, Hasidut, and Rav Kook. Feldmann Kaye does not discuss the biographic element that Rav Shagar and Tamar Ross were friends and talked to each about theology. Nor does it discuss their specific personal uses of Hasidut, Rather, her book discusses the relationship of kabbalah and postmodernism in the thought of Sanford Drob and the role of truth in Heidegger. </p>



<p>The concept Feldmann Kaye focusses on is that of language and especially of Lyotard’s reading of Wittgenstein. Lyotard (mis)used Wittgenstein’s phrase “private language” to mean that there are no longer universal truths. She shows how Rav Shagar and Prof. Ross each have a sense of a private language and she discusses parallels in Richard Rorty, Jean Baudrillard, more Heidegger. &nbsp;I wish she had been more analytic here since Wittgenstein is subject to many interpretations by theologians. Evangelical and Fundamentalists read Wittgenstein as interpreted by the scholar DZ Phillips as a fideism, a dogmatic private language in which the gospels are a private language not subject to any alien methods. In contrast, the scholar Norman Malcolm reads Wittgenstein as only allowing an act of faith since we cannot have any certain knowledge. But I believe Prof Ross is closer to a third reading, in which language is the rules of a game or the grammar. </p>



<p>Finally, Feldmann Kaye’s third topic is revelation based on these ideas of truth and language. She shows that Prof Ross accepts an idea of progressive revelation, a metaphysical idea of the unfolding of the truth, which she based on Kabbalah and Hasidut. But rather than discuss the Ross’ feminist application of this view of revelation, Feldmann Kaye opens up the discussion to Paul Ricoeur’s theory of interpretation. Rav Shagar uses the language of the study hall and treats the ongoing creativity of the Torah scholar in what he calls lamdanut as revelation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be posted a few responses to this interview in order to generate some discussion. I will return with some clarifications and some of my own views on the topics after the responses. We should thank Miriam Feldmann Kaye for opening this discussion with her smart book  <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Theology-Postmodern-Cultural-Studies/dp/1906764689">Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age </a></em> about the importance of contemporary thought for Jewish thology. In the meantime, this is a good chance to read, if you have never read it, Lyotard’s <em>The Postmodern Condition </em>a dated period piece and then jump to the 21<sup>st</sup> century by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anatheism-Returning-Insurrections-Critical-Religion/dp/0231147899">Richard Kearney’s <em>Anatheism: Returning to God After God</em> <em> </em>(2011</a>) to get a sense of how the secular ideas of postmodernism are used by 21<sup>st</sup> century religious theologians including Miriam Feldmann Kaye. </p>

<ol><li><strong>Are you actually discussing postmodernism?</strong></li></ol>



<p>The thinkers I
deal with Rabbi Shagar and Tamar Ross grapple with late 20th century modernist
thought continuing to read current thought through to the current era. Rabbi
Shagar joins several Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century who engaged with
the existentialist movement, Ross with analytic engagement. Both of them
grapple with Rav Kook, joining the ranks of some of the most significant
theologians in contemporary times. </p>



<p>It would be
reductionist to call them ‘postmodern thinkers’. I have clarified this
important point &#8211; that the majority of thinkers I deal with, reject the term “postmodern”,
and especially the label of “postmodern thinker”, and I have tried to respect
this throughout. They are not just postmodern thinkers, but rather, draw on a
breadth and a depth of contemporary philosophical movements.</p>



<p>In fact, I am
not dependent on the term ‘postmodernism’ and would not have been opposed to
using in the title the term “twenty-first century Jewish philosophy”, or even
more specifically, contemporary. In the way in which I have used it,
postmodernism refers to the temporal era of the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> and
start of the 21<sup>st</sup> century A period after modernity – literally
post-modern- in which we see the limits of modernity. In its most basic sense,
postmodernism embodies a critique of different elements of modernity. </p>



<p>Having said
that, taking sensitivities into account, I am not afraid of the term
postmodern, and neither to use the word relativism, and believe that these
words and concepts must challenge and draw us in as much as they repel us. </p>



<p>I do not think that postmodernism immediately signals relativism – it is important and preferable to separate between the two, and challenge the ambivalence towards the term. In the more lenient use of the word ‘postmodern’ in this book, I draw attention to what is meant by using this frame of Jewish thinkers who engage with postmodern philosophy. </p>



<p>2. <strong>Is ambivalence towards Postmodernism justified? </strong></p>



<p>I want to
address the ambivalence towards the term postmodern. Postmodernism is a contentious
word which is easily associated, by some, with a nihilistic relativism. The
outlooks it espouses indeed reflect a breakdown of ultimate truths and values. </p>



<p>I actually
identify with the hesitation surrounding the term, and have sought to break
down the fear in a way that theologians have done for centuries with
surrounding cultural movements which have seemed, and which have been, strongly
at odds, with the worldview that one seeks to maintain. </p>



<p>This is why I
decided to change the title of the book, initially, “Jewish Theology <em>in</em>
a Postmodern Age”, to “Jewish Theology <em>for</em> a Postmodern Age”. This
change frames the purpose of the book – Jewish theology engages with its
contemporaneous philosophical trends, and the volume addresses profound
development of what will, in my view, become an immersion in the areas of
intellectual creativity that the postmodern age has begun to offer. It must be
understood as an enigma which demands our attention and as a challenge to
thought, rather than a corrosive problem which must be destroyed. </p>



<p>The change in
the book was made to highlight the distinctions between postmodern philosophy
and Jewish thought, and to reflect the nature of the book which is a
philosophical quest to understand the parameters of a new conversation. </p>



<p>In light of
this, theology takes an active role engaging in that conversation where
postmodernism as a worldview might be constructive, as well as destructive, to
contemporary Jewish philosophical debate. </p>



<p>I made clear in
the outset of the book, that my aim has not been to defend postmodernism –
rather, to examine its various themes, as a negotiation with diverse elements
of Jewish thought in the twenty-first century. This means leveraging what
philosophy of religion became towards the end of the twentieth century –
existentialist, dialogical, pragmatic, and following how these ideas develop
into the new century. In this sense the main question becomes whether and how Jewish
thought which can function and be compelling, in today’s world.</p>



<p>This change reflects my approach towards the thinkers I deal with: their engagement with issues of the day, does not necessarily class them as postmodern thinkers. Rather, I have written about their thinking as addressing certain issues that postmodern philosophy raises, and the acute questions it raises. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Why is it important to approach Rabbi Shagar’s and Tamar Ross’ thought from a philosophical viewpoint? </strong></p>



<p>One of the main characteristics of the book, has been to set
aside sociological analyses of both Shagar and Ross. My own academic training
has been in the field of philosophy of religion. </p>



<p>This forms the backdrop for my intense engagement with Shagar
and Ross. It is the lens through which I examine numerous texts. I probe their
thinking, asking the critical questions of contemporary times, from a Jewish
perspective. I specifically analyse Shagar’s later engagement with non-Jewish
continental philosophers, even if he did not read them, which is so important,
in my view, for understanding the true contribution he makes to contemporary
Jewish thought. I am interested in the epistemological and linguistic
contributions that Ross makes to Jewish philosophy, seeing feminism as a case
in point, rather than as the central objective. </p>



<p>In Israel, some of the discussion around the yeshiva world of Shagar is associated with New Age and the pop-Hasidut of contemporary “spirituality”. Much continues to be written on this topic. Suffice it to say, there is more than meets the eye to this neo-Hasidic thinking, which actually calls for an understanding of the roles of Hasidut and Kabbalah in postmodern theology. </p>



<p>4. <strong>What are Rabbi Shagar’s and Prof Tamar Ross’s main contributions?</strong></p>



<p>Ross and Shagar
are engaging in an original dialogue about culture, language, revelation. </p>



<p>They both demand
a revision of the concept of Torah and revelation for a postmodern age. Shagar
and Ross are two of the first thinkers to reconceptualise revelation on terms
which do not get caught in the issues of modernity.&nbsp; Although in the book I deal with their
thinking in parallel, I draw points of reference for comparison and contrast. </p>



<p>The book shows how this dialogue is representative of the sort of discussion seeking to engage which strands of contemporary philosophy will be most accepted in contemporary Jewish thought. In this way, we are offered an unusual insight into how they firstly recognise, and secondly handle postmodern ideas. This forms the basis for an analytical consideration of how internal Jewish theological ideas are interpreted in this age.</p>



<p>5. <strong>What is Cultural Particularism?</strong></p>



<p>The
book is split into three main conceptual sections: cultural particularism,
language and revelation. </p>



<p>“Cultural
particularism’” is a central feature of postmodernism.I use
this term to refer to the position which states that our understanding and interaction
with the world is contingent upon culture. </p>



<p>According
to radical interpretations of cultural particularism, the category of
objectivity is limited altogether, and only multiple different perspectives
based on local perceptions and interpretations, each anchored in a specific
cultural context, hold water. </p>



<p>Furthermore,
in these interpretations the notion of objectivity is a figment of our
philosophical imagination, itself conceived through the lenses of our
respective cultures. </p>



<p>In
my book, I analyse the impact of this contentious theory specifically in the
realm of religion. Firstly, postmodern theology regards religion as a
particularistic endeavour, fundamentally rooted in cultural idiosyncrasies. As
a result, it downplays the modernist quest for universal truth and objectivity
outside one’s culture. Secondly, truth claims no longer purport to represent
absolute, universal, and justifiable statements about the world. A radical postmodernist world view conceives of
an individual’s values and beliefs as a drop in an ocean of culturally-accepted
norms. </p>



<p>This shift in thinking carries far-reaching implications in the domain of Jewish theology. Currently, most Jewish religious responses to the challenge of cultural particularism have come, perhaps inevitably, from a generation of thinkers who have found themselves in a transitional period between modernity and postmodernism. Even though philosophically they accept the notion of multiple truths, they still dread the ethical and practical implications of relativism. </p>



<p>6. <strong>How does Rav Shagar deal with Cultural Particularism?</strong></p>



<p>In
discussing their treatment of the problem of multiple truths and relativism, I show
how their arguments facilitate the acceptance of a multiplicity of
truth-claims. Nevertheless, I underscore a persistent refusal on their behalf
to what they view to be a ‘collapse’ into a relativism according to which one’s
own faith holds nothing truer than that of others. </p>



<p>Shagar
appropriates cultural particularism by rendering truth subject to a cultural
context. He rejects the idea of a fixed, monolithic truth as little more than
an artificial, human construct.The way he envisions the community
‘playing’ a sophisticated language game allows for a degree of freedom and
human creativity rarely observed in traditional circles. </p>



<p>Cultural
particularism, the deconstruction of the universal, of the monolithic, is linked
to Shagar’s notion of <em>Beit’iut&nbsp;
-“home-ness” shorashiut – “rootedness”</em>. The philosophical ‘home’ is
the starting point of theology, rather than an empirically decided universal
standpoint. Beitiut is an example that Shagar uses for cultural particularism.
Religious meaning is where the home is. The starting point for &#8216;doing&#8217;
philosophy is not a neutral or objective standpoint &#8211; rather it begins and
necessarily must remain, in the particularist context called &#8216;home&#8217;.</p>



<p>In
Shagar’s discussion on <em>Shabbat</em> and the Hindu ritual of <em>Samadhi</em>,
he draws comparisons between the spirituality of these two states of existence.
The home is the contextual and therefore conceptual starting point, which I
delineate as cultural particularism. </p>



<p>Given the role of immersion in contextual community, often described as a socially constructed community, collective discourses are what inform practice and conversation around its meaning. The individual does not operate in a theological vacuum, as he or she did prior to these times, even in times where existentialism was most prominent in religious discourse – wherein the personal experience affected and was effected by one’s own religious experience – the <em>ennui</em> or malaise of the age. </p>



<p>7. <strong>How does Prof Tamar Ross deal with Cultural Particularism?</strong></p>



<p>Tamar
Ross views local religious truths as valuable precisely because they are
relative to a particular group. She uses this relativism to put forward a
non-empirical, kabbalistic, metaphysical truth, and in so doing, endeavours to
redeem relativism from its negative connotations. She affirms the relative
nature of each religion, and claims that such a conception of religious truth
permeates the history of Jewish thought</p>



<p>&nbsp;Ross, like Shagar, dismisses the self as the
frame of reference for determining reality. She reaches this conclusion by
exploring the implications of a Kookian, Hasidic conception of the divine as a
singular unity, which converge with the postmodern breakdown of subjective and
objective.</p>



<p>Having internalized the
epistemological uncertainty characteristic of the postmodern critique.</p>



<p>Ross seeks to establish a sound ground for religious
knowledge. She turns for that reason to non-foundationalism, a contemporary
epistemological position that justifies truth-claims not on the basis of their
purported grounding in some neutral or objective source of knowledge, but on
the degree to which they cohere with other beliefs and opinions. This attitude
she contrasts favourably against any sort of radical postmodern relativism, which
turns the rejection of absolute truth into nihilism and anarchy on the
simplistic assessment that all truth-claims are of equal value. Instead of
establishing the truth-value of a proposition against the background of an
objective, metaphysical source, non-foundationalists rely on intersubjective
agreement within the wider community</p>



<p>Ross
similarly takes Kook’s innovative and non-traditional theology as an inspiring
model. She describes him as ‘wise to be suspicious of all claims to absolute
truth, or to any direct and perfect correspondence between our perceptions and
ontological reality’. Indeed, she identifies with his scepticism and notes that
such a feeling ultimately leads to ‘a fundamental shift in the expectations
surrounding traditional theological claims’.</p>



<p>However, for her, cultural particularism, does justify one’s
ability to posit a belief of ‘truth’, without believing that this constitutes
the only truth. From an analytic philosophy perspective if a truth is
subjective, then it is not Truth. </p>



<p>From the perspective of continental thought, it is evident that this misses the point. It is perspectival. This forms the demand for postmodern deconstruction of the notion of Truth altogether, linking to the ‘inter-subjectivity’ of Heidegger amongst others. </p>



<p>8. <strong>Is Cultural Particularism relativism?</strong></p>



<p>There is a
question asked of Shagar: if cultural particularism defines the starting point,
the all-pervasive contextualisation of language and culture have the potential
to relativize values as a whole. </p>



<p>We find a response to this question in Ross’ discussion of
the self through Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam- even if it was not used by
Shagar or Ross. Analytic (behaviouralist or neopragmatic) theories of language,
propounded by Rorty, Putnam and Quine, is the idea that language it holds
meaning insofar as it means something to the one who uses or understands that
language. In other words, a metaphysical being or essence is not assumed when
using such language. How is this constructive in philosophy of religion?
Because the distinctions&nbsp;between language as &#8216;true&#8217; or &#8216;false&#8217; need not
bother us so much anymore. Philosophy has moved on from these questions, and
this gives us the opportunity to reconsider a Jewish theory of language. I have
said many times, that this is not necessarily a new idea, but the response to
it, in the relevant discourse, is highly original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Ross, this reading deepens the question as to how
mysticism should be understood. If not given to neo Hasidic spirituality, how
should mysticism be interpreted on the philosophical level? Empirically or
allegorically? In response to the theory of cultural particularism and
relativism, she responds by questioning the role that truth claims play, rather
than their supposed abstract metaphysical essence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Shagar addressed the issue through an interpretation of Slavoj
Zizek’s reading of Jacques Lacan, and the idea of chosenness. Shagar provides us with
a unique reading of this sort of discourse, interspersed with interpretations
of Hasidut, and its relevance to this new thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately Shagar bequeaths to us a “hierarchy of truth”,
rather than an acceptance of the zero sum game that some modern vs. postmodern
debates seem to embody. </p>



<p>I critique all these responses concerning the limitations as to how far Jewish thinkers can go in cultural particularism without falling into relativism. I end this section with a broader observation that the deconstruction of universalism, plays an ethical role in its breakdown of the fallacious belief in ‘one truth fits all’. </p>



<p>9. <strong>How do both thinkers deal with language in a postmodern age?</strong></p>



<p>If language cannot describe anything beyond itself, how can
any statement be true? Do beliefs serve any purpose if they do not express
something true about the world? According to postmodern theory, each culturally
particular community functions according to its own semantic and linguistic
system, similar to Martin Heidegger’s “intra-worldly” and Ross’ “inter-subjectivity”.
</p>



<p>For Tamar Ross, certain aspects of this new postmodern philosophy
of religion become fundamental in examining what we mean when we use
theological language. To give three examples, Francois Lyotard claimed that
meaning is contingent on its context. For Rorty, language serves the claim of
different collectives, and in this sense is functional. Jurgen Habermas and
others view this in a constructive way – how does meaning arise in a particular
cultural context? </p>



<p>Wittgenstein’s theory of the “language game” is utilised at
various points in constructing postmodern positions, by Shagar and Ross. </p>



<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein&#8217;s concept of &#8221;language games&#8221;&nbsp;is
often held up as his flagship contribution to the philosophy of language.
However, his idea of &#8216;Forms of Life&#8217; is critical in studying a contemporary
Jewish consideration of religious language. It is in fact&nbsp;far more telling
of the nature of religion today,&nbsp;and how language functions as a
theological tool in our communities.</p>



<p>Thus, the role of Wittgensteinian thought must be reconsidered. It is at this point where the role of language comes in. Ross in a way, clears the path for what Shagar means when he speaks of revelation.</p>



<p>10. <strong>Does Language affect Reality?</strong></p>



<p>Before the advent of postmodernism,
philosophers generally viewed language as concordant with reality. In other
words, they assumed that the words, phrases, and sentences we use correspond to
the objects in the world that we purport to describe. This assumption that a
‘signifier’ (most notably, in speech) necessarily relates to a specific
‘signified’ is known as ‘correspondence theory’. Philosophers of language, in
turn, seek to investigate the nature of this relation. They consider, among
other questions, <em>whether</em> and <em>how</em> language reflects reality. This is
known as ‘the problem of language’.<strong></strong></p>



<p>For Shagar, language illustrates,
and manifests itself through, reality. It is the nature of reality, which
changes, together with that of language. According to Jean Baudrillard, the
very nature of reality alters according to the cultural-linguistic turn. I
discuss his theory of semiotics as coinciding with theological interpretations
of reality. </p>



<p>Shagar wrote about Baudrillard,
combining his thinking on the nature of reality with mysticism. This led Shagar
to an analysis of the role of mystical language as descriptive of reality,
without having to be understood as empirically historic. Semiotics is the study of signs. It relies on the fact that our
understanding of society comes through ‘signification’ (signs) which are
referred to by language and in the media, but that do not exist in and of
themselves. Hence language and cultural rituals <em>symbolize</em>, but do not embody, reality.</p>



<p>Today’s world is full of ‘signs’. Although we may not be fully
aware of them, these signs surround us, and effectively build up what
Baudrillard terms a simulated ‘hyper-reality’. Facebook and Twitter, for
example, create an artificial, simulated social existence. Virtual exchanges on
the cyberspace&#8212;on our smartphones and computers&#8212;allow individuals to bypass
reality. It is crucial to
recognize that a simulated reality is not a false reality. It means that we are
aware of the factors that make our reality what it is. Shagar turns to
Baudrillard to reconfigure the role of language in postmodern religion. His
position is original on two accounts: it acknowledges the problem of language,
and in response, re-envisages it as a network of signs that help the religious
community generate its own simulated reality.To him, the language
of the community serves to engender, rather than merely refer to, the religious
values of its adherents. </p>



<p>The way Shagar is able to accommodate these positions is by relying
on the Jewish mystical tradition. He employs concepts drawn most notably from
Lurianic kabbalah and Bratslav hasidism to draw out a theological discourse
that comprises both postmodern linguistic elements and traditional ones.</p>



<p>Through Ross we arrive at a fascinating, and
distinct treatment of the language in her interest in the structures and types
of language available to us. For her, the metaphor is instrumental in opening a
world of reality which might lend themselves to, as she says, “direct
intimations of the Divine”, </p>



<p>&nbsp;For Jacques Derrida, we find that metaphors can express truths with more power than any literal statement. For language is poetic, and imaginative, rather than literal. So, literal statements about empirical facts on which religious claims might be made, are in fact, lacking in their potential for describing a reality far beyond what is imaginable, and therefore more fitting to the sort of dialogue that we have. The purposes of language in the realm of theology, are less to describe factual events, and more to create and sustain a phenomenologically compelling image of the world as it is true to us. In this sense, we move further away from the language game as a problem for theology. </p>



<p>11. <strong>How do the chapters on culture and language lead to a new approach to revelation?</strong></p>



<p>The first two
chapters bring together a new approach to <em>Torah min Hashamayim ‘ (loosely
‘translated’ as Torah from Heaven) </em>wherein the ‘text’ responds to the
issues raised in the two previous chapters. <em>Torah min hashamayim</em> (Torah
from Heaven) is released from modern ongoing debates of science vs religion.
Denominations as being formed around responses to these questions. Certain
Jewish communities, particular in the diaspora, retain this question as the
overall arbiter of what is meant by Jewish thought. Moreover, it is applied to
aspects of Jewish practice. </p>



<p>Ross’ epistemology is her idea of cumulative revelation –
where Torah min Hashamayim is understood as a perpetually unfolding reality,
manifesting itself in the lives of those who live by it. Shagar’s position is
not dissimilar – but expressed in a more yeshiva-style way, wherein truths and
meaning in Torah are unravelled through <em>Lamdanut</em>&nbsp; &#8211; ultimately a theory of interpretation and
hermeneutics. Torah inherently refers to and embodies continual revelation. For
both, <em>Torah min Hashamayim</em> is a continual, ongoing, dynamic process,
accompanied by upholders of the faith via halakhic debate and praxis, and
engagement with textual exegesis and its intersections with the <em>ruach</em> –
spirit &#8211; of the world around us. The will of God is continually discovered in
each generation. Neither position is necessarily ‘postmodern’ but it is
expressed in language of the cultural-linguistic turn. So, the “life of the
text” as Mikhail Bakhtin argues, presents a solicitation of the text within and
outside of a language game, reaching out beyond this world to an unspeakable
reality – necessarily undetermined (“deferred” according to Derrida) in
postmodern theory. </p>



<p>The book compares Tamar Ross to Paul Ricoeur’s understanding of the “conflict of interpretations” and its meaning in a textually generative community. Linguistic interpretative techniques are esoteric in their nature, pulled out of a static existenceand given a life of their own, in a dynamic, living process. Similarly, for Shagar,<em> Lamdanut</em>, does not constitute a language game, but a reaching out for a reality, generating its genuineness as a phenomenological community. <em>Lamdanut</em> and biblical and Talmudic interpretation, represents a grappling with the text which fits with the notion of postmodern hermeneutic activity as part of the continuing manifestation of oral Torah. It is here that Covenant becomes the immense and intense engagement in this process, in its various manifestations.</p>



<p>12. <strong>How is phenomenology important to this thinking about revelation?</strong></p>



<p>The phenomenological
movement of the 1920’s sought to explore the philosophical articulation of
human experience. Edmund Husserl, and later, Martin Heidegger, put forward the
claim that experience happens with human existence, rather than as separate
from it. Whilst it was others who were to apply this to religion, it has come
to provide a different and more useful way of considering religious language
and the experience around linguistic dialogue. Experience is a key component of
how religious meaning and truth are understood. Religious phenomena include the
sense of the miraculous, the encounter with a striking text, or the sensation
of transcendence at a holy site. It is the community as phenomenological
discourse, which accepts upon itself the ultimate link to and connection with
Torah. </p>



<p>Revelation as “perpetual revelation” is a development on the
acceptance of the ideas of cultural particularism and language. Revelation and
the language through which it is understood and experienced, depend on the
nature of reality. </p>



<p><em>Torah min Hashamayim</em> becomes the primary cultural particularist,
linguistic conduit, for religious experience, rather one that works against it.
Study is itself done through language and Torah is transmitted from Moses to
Sinai in our very textual and dialogic activity. This is one of the main points
that we arrive at in postmodern Jewish theology.</p>



<p>&nbsp;And it is this that I
have termed Visionary Theology – an embryonic model for Jewish thought today. </p>



<p>The methodology reflects the objective, which is to weave
together postmodern and Jewish thinking side by side, rather than as
conflicting opposites. &nbsp;I place
Jean-Francois Lyotard and Michel Foucault alongside Jewish thinkers in speaking
about the first step of my claim – cultural particularism. Much of contemporary
Christian post-metaphysical theology deals similar themes, such as that of
Jean-Luc Marion and Richard Kearney – an area of theology which I continue to
research. </p>



<p>I have put forward the case for their opening up to a
Visionary Theology which does not rely on an ultimate and singular truth, but
posits instead that the notion of a multiplicity of truths as compatible with
Judaism. </p>



<p>The implications are twofold:
firstly, since faith does
not lend itself to scientific verification, it becomes difficult to justify a
preference for one’s own world view or way of life. Second, if
such truths are perceived as culturally particular
social constructs, their prime function is limited to defining communal
boundaries. </p>
