										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Guest post by Avraham Bronstein</strong></p>
<p>This past Saturday night, I made the drive from Scranton, PA, to Airmont, NY for Selichot led by the colorful hasidic music star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipa_Schmeltzer">Lipa Schmeltzer.</a></p>
<p>Lipa founded his own shul, <em>The Airmont Shul,</em>  in 2008 following his break with the Skvere hasidic community over the contemporary style of his music, his flamboyant personal style, and, later, his secular higher education. The building features a musical motif throughout, including mezuzot cases in the shape of flutes and an ark shaped like a harp. An electric guitar hangs on one wall.</p>
<p>An established sensation in the hasidic and yeshivish music worlds for some time, Lipa has recently attained a following in the more modern elements of Orthodoxy, giving concerts at luxury hotels. summer camps and in modern Orthodox synagogues.  He is now attending Columbia University for a long awaited BA, something denied him growing up Hasidic. He also gives a twice weekly, widely viewed &#8220;Sheni ve Hamishi&#8221; words of Torah on Facebook. Most of the time the videos are calls to tolerate, get along, and be kind. Recently, he caused a wave by calling for Hasidic women, from Hungarian dynasties, not to shave their heads as prescribed. Lipa has gotten really good press in recent months &#8211; <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/music/191829/lipa-schmeltzer">here,</a> <a href="http://gothamist.com/2015/02/18/hasidic_pop_star_lipa.php">here</a>, and<a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-14/meet-hasidic-lady-gaga"> here.</a></p>
<p>Before the Selichot began, Lipa welcomed guests to his synagogue, which he described as “improvisational,” and briefly introduced the program for the evening. (“God is my witness, I have not prepared a word of what I’m going to say, but we’ll see how it comes out.”)</p>

<p>Despite the professional-quality flyer disseminated on social media and the presence of two guitarists and a keyboardist for accompaniment, Lipa explained that the idea for a large-scale musical service was only conceived several days before. Supporting this assertion was the lack of Selichot books for use in the synagogue. Some people had brought their own, and many others (myself included) quickly downloaded the text to our phones. Still others went without.</p>
<p>The crowd numbered about 100 people, mostly yeshivish and hasidic-looking men from the Airmont/Monsey area. Guests came from communities ranging from Scranton, PA, Nassau County and Westchester, NY, and Bergen County, NJ. For the most part, the out-of-town visitors tended to look more Modern Orthodox. The crowd seemed a bit restless at first, talking  and shuffling about. Lipa stopped during his opening lines concluding “Ashrei” to ask for silence, and there was a fair amount of “buzz” and cellphone photography/videography throughout.</p>
<p>Lipa went fairly quickly through the standard liturgy using a fairly basic <em>nussach</em> (musical motif) for Selichot. The service was really based, however, around several extended singing and dancing breaks, sometimes based around words from the paragraph being read, and other times more free-form.</p>
<p>During the periods typically reserved for silent congregational reading, Lipa would lead a song or niggun as well. All the piyyutim were done in record time; many people just listened to his background singing.</p>
<p>The music tended towards the upbeat and the Carlebach repertoire, and not his own material. In the beginning, he seemed to be imitating Carlebach&#8217;s spirit in style and stories. At one point some words were sung to what sounded like a Billy Joel song and the opening of the Ark in the middle of the service was accompanied by what Lipa said was a waltz that particularly appealed to him and then Avraham Fried’s “Aderaba.” At many points, Lipa would hand the microphone to a friend to lead the singing while he circulated through the synagogue dancing and clapping to generate energy and encourage the dancing. Lipa’s enthusiasm, presence, and showmanship were infectious, and very clearly the lifeblood of the synagogue.</p>
<p>One thing that was not sung was the standard Ashamnu. Before the Ashamnu recitation, Lipa explained that the confessional section of the service was exceedingly personal, between each individual and God. He could not offer guidance, as he had throughout, or suggestions to guide our thoughts, so he would just play a “freiliche song” and we could each chose to silently meditate or proceed as we felt appropriate.</p>
<p>Lipa founded <em>The Airmont Shul</em> in the wake of a painful and public break from the insular hasidic community he was born into. He referenced the difficult founding of the synagogue and his painful personal journey several times. As the service began, he shared that, for him, the night would be a meditation on not judging others, something he said he still finds himself doing too often, especially in light of how he himself has so often been the subject of judgement by others.</p>
<p>He honored Rabbi Dov Oliver, Hillel Director of Rockland County Community <a href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg"><br />
</a>College, where he was a student before transferring to Columbia, with the opening of the Ark before the responsive singing of Shema Koleinu, calling him a mentor who helped him immeasurably as he regained his spiritual footing.<a href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7113" data-permalink="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/selichos-with-lipa/lipa2/" data-orig-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg" data-orig-size="960,540" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Lipa2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg?w=500" class="size-medium wp-image-7113 alignright" src="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169" alt="Lipa2" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg?w=600&amp;h=338 600w, https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite their ultra-Orthodox dress and look, it was clear that many of his local attendees share similar stories of being judged or being marginal, and that being a part of his congregation was, for some, socially and politically fraught with  tension.</p>
<p><a href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7114" data-permalink="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/selichos-with-lipa/lipa1/" data-orig-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg" data-orig-size="960,540" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Lipa1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg?w=500" class="size-medium wp-image-7114 alignleft" src="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169" alt="Lipa1" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg?w=600&amp;h=338 600w, https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lipa1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>At the beginning, Lipa asked people who planned to take cellphone pictures or video to only do so in one half the synagogue, and to respect those who expressed their desire to not be photographed by standing on the other side. (He joked, “If someone does appear in a picture, we can always say it was photo-shopped and he wasn’t really here.”) He revisited that theme before the responsive singing of Hashivenu (“Bring us back, O Lord, and we will return”) when he noted the different journeys, both spiritual and physical, that brought his diverse congregation together.</p>
<p>The musical selections towards the end tended to be slower and more contemplative, including a Yossi Green song for Shomer Yisrael and the now-standard Machnisei Rachamim made famous by Avraham Freid. Lipa ended the service with a blast from a shofar before the final kaddish (sung to the Modzitz melody), which led into a post-Selichot round of upbeat dancing. The entire service ran just under two hours, concluding at 1:00am.</p>
<p>There was a women&#8217;s section, but less than a handful showed up. One women who traveled to be there was disappointed. According to her, the women seemed like they were there to wait for their husbands as displayed by their continuous smartphone use. Also during the second hour of selichos, many men had already gone outside to smoke and socialize.</p>
<p>At one point before the end of the service, Lipa remarked how overwhelmed he was by the distance some people traveled to attend, and how everyone who was in attendance from &#8220;out of town&#8221; would receive a CD before returning home. True to his word, as soon as the last dance ended, he dashed out of the synagogue and returned with a stack of CDs. I received two, including his most recent album &#8220;Be Positive!,&#8221; featuring hasidic dance and electronic music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Guest Post by Rabbi Avraham Bronstein<br />
</strong>Rabbi Bronstein serves as North American Development Executive for Ohr Torah Stone. From 2006-2011 he was Associate Rabbi of The Hampton Synagogue. He tweets at <a href="http://twitter.com/avbronstein">@AvBronstein</a> and launched a new blog, <a href="http://cloudpulpit.wordpress.com/">cloudpulpit.wordpress.com</a>, where the following is <a href="http://cloudpulpit.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/korach-and-the-failure-of-moses-meritocracy/">cross-posted</a>.</p>
<p> This is an adaptation of a sermon I delivered last week at a modern orthodox synagogue in the greater NY area. It is reworked slightly to include some material from other discussions and talks from Shabbat and beyond, and also eliminates some of the sermon filler. In conversation, I found that many people saw Korach as a sort of spiritual socialist, sort of a classic cold-war era sermon topic. I tried to make the discussion more contemporary.</p>
<p>Imagine a nation run as a meritocracy, where leaders rose to the top as they proved that they were brighter, more motivated, more assertive &#8212; true “leaders,” in every sense of the word. Things started well &#8211; there was a period of rapid growth and development, and everyone seemed to be sharing the rewards of the superior decisions and leadership that were coming from what was, by now, a trusted elite. Then, from out of the blue, something went very wrong. The leadership made a terrible collecive mistake, an epic misjudgment so out of line that the people assume they were collectively guilty of criminal negligence, if not outright corruption. As the grim, full reality of the disaster sets in, it becomes clear that all of the previous gains have essentially been erased, and the whole generation itself will go down in history as a wasted one.</p>
<p>Now imagine that, through it all, the meritocracy remains intact. The same leaders remain in charge, demanding the same levels of trust and of faith as though nothing had happened, with no effective safeguards in place to keep it from happening again. We would naturally expect the rise of popular movements to voice the people&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/148163/Americans-Confident-Military-Least-Congress.aspx">loss of confidence in the failed status quo</a>. The truth is that this scenario actually happens quite often. In 2010, their motto was, “<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125184586">Don&#8217;t tread on me</a>.” In 2011, they chanted, “<a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/">We are the 99%</a>.” And in last week&#8217;s Torah Portion it was Korach challenging Moses, insisting that “the entire community is holy, and God rests among them, so why do you lord yourself over the congregation of God?”</p>
<p><span id="more-5282"></span></p>
<p>David Brooks would answer Korach by telling him that things are not necessarily worse than they ever were and things would improve, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/opinion/brooks-the-follower-problem.html?_r=1">if only he were a better follower</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>we have to relearn the art of following. Democratic followership is also built on a series of paradoxes: that we are all created equal but that we also elevate those who are extraordinary; that we choose our leaders but also have to defer to them and trust their discretion; that we’re proud individuals but only really thrive as a group, organized and led by just authority.<br />
I don’t know if America has a leadership problem; it certainly has a followership problem. Vast majorities of Americans don’t trust their institutions. That’s not mostly because our institutions perform much worse than they did in 1925 and 1955, when they were widely trusted. It’s mostly because more people are cynical and like to pretend that they are better than everything else around them. Vanity has more to do with rising distrust than anything else.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along the same lines, the Midrash paints a picture of Korach not making a principled spiritual argument, but instead <a href="http://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p08.htm#THE REBELLION OF KORAH">acting in response to his ambition and jealousy</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>He believed Moses had slighted him by appointing his cousin Elizaphan as chief of the Levite division of Kohathites. He said: &#8220;My grandfather had four sons, Amram, Ishar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Amram, as the firstborn, had privileges of which his sons availed themselves, for Aaron is high priest and Moses is king; but have not I, the son of Izhar, the second son of Kohath, the rightful claim to be prince of the Kohathites? Moses, however, passed me by and appointed Elizaphan, whose father was Uzziel, the youngest son of my grandfather. Therefore will I now stir up rebellion against Moses, and overthrow all institutions founded by him.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Yosef_Leiner">Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner</a>, the Ishbitzer Rebbe (19th century, Poland), Korach was actually correct in theory. His undoing was not a matter of argument, of principle, but merely a matter of timing. He says Korach should have objected when the tribe of Levi was itself elevated over the other 11 tribes, when Korach and his extended family were given rights and responsibilities beyond those of the typical Israelite:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>But regarding Korach&#8217;s claim, King Solomon said (Proverbs 20:26) &#8220;The wise King scatters (&#8216;<em><strong>mezareh</strong>&#8216;</em>) the wicked, and turns the wheel (&#8216;<em><strong>ofen</strong></em>&#8216;) over them.&#8221; That is to say, God had already placed the wreath (&#8216;<strong><em>zer</em></strong>&#8216;) and the crown (of the Levites) upon them, and thus had already elevated their status. And in regards to this, Hashem &#8220;turns their own character traits (&#8216;<strong><em>ofen</em></strong>&#8216;) against them. &#8221; God asked them, &#8220;Why is it that when I granted you this lofty status you didn&#8217;t complain immediately, saying &#8216;There is no hierarchy in Israel and no individual should be set higher than his fellow man.&#8217;?&#8221; (Translation <a href="http://mei-ha-shiloah.blogspot.com/2009/06/mei-ha-shiloah-on-parashat-korach.html">Elli Sacks</a>)</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>I think that Korach may well be correct in his argument – the meritocracy had indeed failed. The Israelites had encountered one setback after another on their short journey from Egypt. Most recently, the leadership fell right into the sin of the spies, which Moses and Aaron never saw coming.</p>
<p>The problem was not necessarily Korach&#8217;s ambition, jealousy, or ideology. It was, was that the only person who could force Moses to confront the enormity of the breakdown that had occurred and articulate to him the loss of confidence that the people had in their leaders and institutions was himself a leading member of the Levite tribe.</p>
<p>As if in response to Brooks, Chris Hayes, of The Nation and MSNBC, recently published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Elites-America-After-Meritocracy/dp/0307720454/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340770133&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=america+after+meritocracy">Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy</a>. Hayes makes the point that an ongoing, competitive meritocracy almost automatically creates a wide chasm between the elite and the masses, between the rulers and the ruled. From within what was once called an ivory tower, but is now called an echo chamber, interacting only with others who are very much like them, who think very much like them, and who share their basic interests and concerns, the elite, over time, become less elite. Their judgments are less reliable, their grasp on reality is shakier &#8211; even as they consolidate more and more power and influence. It is all too easy to have terrible lapses, whether by sheer negligence flowing from being out of touch with the &#8220;real world&#8221; or outright criminal activity driven by the heat of competition (<a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/168265/why-elites-fail">Adapted excerpt in The Nation</a>). Think Enron, the Housing Bubble, Katrina – or the sin of the spies.</p>
<p>Moses lived alone near the Tabernacle, far from mainstream Israelite society, where he most regularly interacted with God and his appointed elders, who answered only to him. Is it so hard to imagine that they did not correctly anticipate how the people might react to any given situation?</p>
<p>The Midrash is sensitive to this reading, providing stories of Korach accumulating massive wealth on the way out of Egypt that motivated him into confrontation with Moses. As Aaron Swartz writes in his<a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/18/guest-review-by-aaron-swartz-chris-hayes-the-twilight-of-the-elites/"> review of Hayes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As competition takes over at the high end, personal worth resolves into exchange value, and the elite power accumulated in one sector can be traded for elite power in another: a regulator can become a bank VP, a modern TV host can use their stardom to become a bestselling author (try to imagine Edward R. Murrow using the nightly news to flog his books the way Bill O’Reilly does). This creates a unitary elite, detached from the bulk of society, yet at the same time even more insecure. You can never reach the pinnacle of the elite in this new world; even if you have the most successful TV show, are you also making blockbuster movies? bestselling books? winning Nobel Prizes? When your peers are the elite at large, you can never clearly best them.<br />
The result is that our elites are trapped in a bubble, where the usual pointers toward accuracy (unanimity, proximity, good faith) only lead them astray. And their distance from the way the rest of the country really lives makes it impossible for them to do their jobs justly—they just don’t get the necessary feedback.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first verses of the portion note the presence of &#8216;On, son of Pelet in the insurrection. At the end of the story, everyone is punished – except for &#8216;On. The Midrash explains that &#8216;On was saved by his wife, who tells him, “Why are you, a regular person, getting involved? If Moses wins, everything stays the same. If Korach wins, everything stays the same, except Korach is in charge!” In the end, &#8216;On sleeps through the final confrontation, appropriately, since it was, as his wife correctly noted, more or less irrelevant to his life.</p>
<p>In the end, of course, Moses is re-validated and the status quo is preserved, but God did not speak to Moses again for an entire generation. The episode of Korach, according to most sources, took place immediately following the sin of the spies, in the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. The narrative resumes in the 40th year of the Israelites&#8217; journey through the wilderness, prompting the Midrashic note that God did not speak to Moses even once in the 38 intervening years.</p>
<p>I would suggest that God&#8217;s silence was constructive, not punative. As a new generation of Israelites matured and prepared to inherit their promised land, God did not want their leaders to turn only towards Moses, and He did not want Moses to turn directly to God. Instead, He wanted leaders who would look down, turning towards the people to be in tune with their concerns, issues, and values. As Hayes documents, the authority that we place in meritocracy is only viable if there is also accountability, communication, and perspective.</p>
<p>Korach did not understand that, as a Levi, his challenge to Moses was actually also an argument against himself. We live in a world that is so interconnected, where our lives and thoughts and actions affect so many other people – often beneath the surface, thousands of miles away, or not readily apparent.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even when we are correct in theory, our perspective is just not wide enough. Sometimes we’re like Moses, spending so much time in the clouds, talking to God, that we forget that our ideas impact real people. Sometimes we are like Korach, not realizing that we are actually arguing against ourselves, against who we really are and what we truly represent. The entire tragic episode reminds us that, if we really want our values and ideals are to impact the world, to really improve the world, we first have to really understand ourselves, to think very deeply about where we are, where we are going, and who we are taking along for the ride.</p>
