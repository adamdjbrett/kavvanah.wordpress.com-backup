				<p>In honor of Kislev, I post Rabbi Shagar on Hanukah. It will give everyone a chance to read it in advance.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Gershon_Rosenberg">Rabbi Shagar </a>(d. 2007), was a Torah scholar and a contemporary religious thinker left a deep mark on the educators and students of the generation.</p>
<p>This essay <a title="r-shagar-chabad-chanukah" href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/r-shagar-chabad-chanukah.docx">“Screen for the Spirit, Garment for the Soul”</a> is a discussion of R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi’s discourse on the candles of Hanukah, from R. Shagar’s discourses on Hanukah, <em>To Illuminate the Openings </em>(להאיר את הפתחים)  (Machon Kitve ha-Rav Shagar: Efrat, 2014), 53-6.</p>
<p>The translation was done in first draft by Rabbi Josh Rosenfeld, a RIETS graduate who was a <em>lone soldier</em> in the IDF through the Second Lebanon War. He is the assistant rabbi at Lincoln Square Synagogues and is on the Judaic Studies Faculty at SAR High School. It was <a href="http://seforim.blogspot.com/2015/12/screen-for-spirit-garment-for-soul.html">first posted last year on a different blog </a>and has been repurposed and completely revived and reedited for this blog. If anyone else has made personal translations of essays by Rav Shagar, I would be glad to post them. (Also if you find errors in this translation, please let me know).</p>

<p>In my past blog posts, we have discussed his <a href="../../../../2011/09/02/rav-shagar-btorato-yehageh-the-study-of-talmud-as-a-quest-for-god-part-i/index.html">approach to Torah study, </a><a href="../../../../2015/01/18/rav-shagar-to-be-connected-to-eyn-living-in-a-postmodern-world/index.html">his post modernism, </a><a href="../../../../2012/07/05/rav-shagar-movie-tribute-to-his-life-and-thought/index.html">watched a TV documentary about his lif</a>e and <a href="../../../../2013/08/21/datlash-hardal-according-to-rav-shagar/index.html">his views of a return to traditionalism away from method and ideology</a>. Recently, we looked at his essay on <a href="../../../../2016/10/26/judaism-and-post-modernity-rabbi-shagar-in-english-translation/index.html">post-modernism.</a> We also looked at how <a href="../../../../2016/09/17/smadar-cherlow-who-moved-my-judaism-judaism-post-modernism-and-contemporary-spirituality/index.html">Smadar Cherlow portrayed the post- Rabbi Shagar turn.</a></p>
<p>This discourse-essay has three parts moving us from an acknowledgement of modern autonomy in part one, then presents a humanism of an embedded lived narrative in part two and concludes with a defense of full obedience to mizvot using post-modern terms.</p>
<p>In the first part, Rav Shagar sets the problem as a tension between the fixed halakhah and the need for authenticity and religious experience as found in Hasidut. This is standard neo-Hasidic fare of treating Hasidut as a romanticism.  The essay asks: If God is infinite, then how can we come to God by mean of the mizvot, which are finite and limiting. Also if Hasidut teaches us the value of personal religious experience and autonomy, then how can we settle for fixed rules and obedience? Ideally, in an existential reading of observance, we need to have the subjective and objective come together as fixed rules and intention, as both external performance and interior affect, halakhah and kavvanah. But, unlike the 20<sup>th</sup> century answers, Rabbi Shagar states that we lack the strength for this ideal approach, and cannot live like that, therefore we need the <em>Shulkhan Arukh</em> as fixed halakhah. As a side point, he mentions that those striving for autonomy lack etiquette, showing that he is thinking hippie not modernist.</p>
<p>The second part of the essay is the most original in which he reframes the question of meaning away from autonomy and experience toward living a meaningful life consisting of many embodied moments. Rabbi Shagar invokes an experiential payoff for mizvot. The same way our life is made up of many physical acts and events that have no intrinsic value by themselves, rather the totality of our lives creates meaning. He has shifted the term “meaning” from authenticity to a meaningful life. (The lived experience as we find in authors such as Marilynne Robinson or Anna Marie Quindlen).</p>
<p>In part two, Hasidut shows how the infinite is channeled in the physical tangible garments and conduits of mizvot, which are the lived events that make up our lives. He answered the opening question of the essay on how can physical mizvot lead to the infinite by stating that mitzvot are garments and vessels of light, which allow us to find our experience.</p>
<p>The third part of the discourse shows his creativity in application of his ideas to the Hasidic text and from the Hasidic text. In the third part, Rav Shagar, writes that mizvot are not just subjective symbols, rather they are God’s infinite meaning, specifically they are how God lives out his manifestation in the physical world. Habad has always taught that God dwells in the lower realms,(<em>dirah batahtonim</em>)  which he connects to both Leibowitz’s idea of pure obedience and to post-modernism.</p>
<p>The essential question at the start of the third section is: If religion is just the way we give meaning to our lives then is it just a subjective system? (For a post-secular answer see Julia Kristeva below).</p>
<p>Rabbi Shagar answers that the mizvot are objective in that they reflect God’s need for meaning, hence he needs the embodied mizvot to allow his manifestation.</p>
<p>Using the ideas of the French psychoanalytic thinker, Jacques Lacan (d.1981) whose language was important for post-structural thinking, Rabbi Shagar applies the contemporary language to Hasidic texts. On one foot, Lacan thought religion is entirely our subjectivity, in order to cover up our psychic wounds and holes using the ”imaginary” and the “symbolic”. Lacan labels as “imaginary” the stabilizing fictions that covers up a lack or hole. Lacan labels as “symbolic” all the social structures from language to law which we use to stabilize &#8220;reality.&#8221; The symbolic carves up the world into language, but in doing so, must always leave something out. The “Real” is precisely what is &#8220;left out&#8221; after the symbolic cuts up the world. An excess that resists symbolization. Sometimes the Real, &#8220;erupts&#8221; in the symbolic order causing a traumatic event. Rabbi Shagar responds to the implicit relativism by claiming, using hasidut, that the symbolic realm of mizvot are God’s need, His signification and symbolic realm.</p>
<p>For Rabbi Shagar, when the Admor of Chabad wrote that mitzvot are not just a garment of Divine light but Divine itself, it is a symbolization of divine need. Mitzvot therefore have no social or human aspects.</p>
<p>He connects the human experiential aspects presented in the first two parts of the discourse and the symbolization of the Infinite Divine in the third part to the Chabad text. In the language of Chabad, these two parts are the garment and encompassing (makifim) of Divine light. However, the important point is that since the lower is higher in Chabad, then the aspect of lower encompassing (makifim) in the mizvot is actually the highest access to divinity.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shagar concludes that mizvot have no reason since they are God’s need and God’s symbolization, not ours. We cannot psychoanalyze God to know his reasons. Therefore, halakhah is a closed system, without external referents to ethics, a conceptual system, or our human meaning. This conclusion moves the reader far from the ideas in part one but without erasing the existentialism thrust of part one. In our post-modern age, there is no longer any grand narrative or justification of Torah and mizvot. The infinite is now only know in the finite mizvot.  In other essays, Rabbi Shagar, connects this idea with Rav Nachman of Breslov’s idea of the mystical void without meaning and with Lyotard’s postmodernism of no grand narrative.</p>
<p>As an aside in a footnote, Rav Shagar sees an unlikely parallel between his thought and Yeshayahu Leibowitz, however Chabad texts would disagree in that that emphasize personal experience and the Lacan language in which mizvot are the return of the Divine repressed, as the Real, is foreign to modernist volitional religion.</p>
<p>Rav Shagar allowed his listener to use post-modern language but without a collapse of meaning or subjectivity since everything is guaranteed by God whose mitzvot we follow. Mizvot are not our human imaginal for the Real but God’s. He also still uses the the modernist ideas of individuality and autonomy.</p>
<p>For those who really wanted to probe the questions of the third part of the essay, I recommend Julia Kristeva’s wonderful first essay in her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Incredible-Believe-European-Perspectives/dp/0231147856"><em>This Incredible Need to Believe</em> </a>By Julia Kristeva, (Columbia University Press, 2009) part of which is <a href="http://www.kristeva.fr/believe.html">available online here.</a> Kristeva as a post-secular and post-Lacan thinker responds to Lacan by writing that we can never escape the psychological necessity for religion as a medium to work out our hidden recesses. In other works, she shows this process in various mystical thinkers emphasizing their psychic melancholia, horror, and desire.</p>
<p>Kristeva assume “religion” to be self-evident, and to be a matter of belief, which for Kristeva means “to give one’s heart, one’s vital force in expectation of a reward” (p. 4). This reward comes in two “prereligious” forms in the psychoanalytic narrative. The first is the “oceanic feeling” to which Freud famously had no access—the ego’s ecstatic dissolution into the universe, which recalls her infantile union with the maternal body (pp. 7–8). The second is the child’s “primary identification” with the father, whose recognition individuates her by pulling her out of the mystic-maternal sea (p. 10). These two stages correspond to the two stages in Lacan and, by extension, are found in Rav Shagar’s thought.</p>
<p>For Kristeva, her understanding of belief offers resources for a new humanism, in which humanism and atheism need to be willing to engage with religion and acknowledge the powerful and ineradicable need to believe.  If we deny it we risk the destructive return of the repressed. Kristeva’s position is not simply affirming the traditional conservative view that we need a return to faith or a new synthesis of faith and reason or as a ground of morals. For her, it’s not that God exists or does not exist, so too the clash  between religious and non-religious constituencies is superficial. Kristeva thinks human beings are constituted by an incredible need to believe, a drive to believe, to have faith or trust in reality in some powerful and ideal sense, and this is tied up with our existence as speaking beings. To be capable of speech is to be capable of symbolic discourse, and symbolic discourse is characterized by a profound need to believe</p>
<p>In the end, like Rabbi Shagar, Kristeva has two points grounding her system. She thinks the <em>need to believe</em> is rooted in the signifying potentiality of this father of pre-history, this guarantor of symbolic meaning. Second, <em>the contents</em> of any belief structure, any orthodoxy, mark an attempt to contain the potentiality, that ensues from this experience of ecstasy. As a psychoanalyst, religion re-forges for Kristeva an &#8220;access to the sacred,&#8221; but by way of the secular. In an opposite manner, as a Rosh Yeshiva, the secular meaning of our lives and the need to engage in the wider world, forges for Rav Shagar a connection with the sacred.  As Shagar wrote elsewhere: “the transition from a ‘Religion of Truth’ to a ‘Religion of Belief’ is the most profound point of Post-Modernism.”</p>

<p><a title="r-shagar-chabad-chanukah" href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/r-shagar-chabad-chanukah.docx">“Screen for the Spirit, Garment for the Soul”</a> (link has essay for easy downloading) from <em>To Illuminate the Openings </em>(להאיר את הפתחים)  (Machon Kitve ha-Rav Shagar: Efrat, 2014), 53-6. First draft was by Josh Rosenfeld and second draft by Alan Brill. I thank Rabbi Rosenfled for letting me freely <a href="http://seforim.blogspot.com/2015/12/screen-for-spirit-garment-for-soul.html">reedit his earlier translation from the Seforim blog.</a></p>
<h2><strong>&#8220;Screen for the Spirit, Garment for the Soul”</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Soul and the Commandment</strong></p>
<p>There is a well-known custom of many Hasidic rabbis on Hanukah to sit by the lit candles and to contemplate them, sometimes for hours. This meditation immerses the spirit and allows the psyche to open up to a whole host of imaginings, discoveries, thoughts, and emotions, which subsequently blossom into, what Chabad thought formulates as, the “words of the living God”. Therefore, looking at the physical entity is instructive. The candle and its light are crucial elements in the explanation of the meditation upon the candlelight.</p>
<p>For example, R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi  (1745-1812; henceforth, Admor ha-Zaken) distinguishes between two different types of light emanating from the candle:<em> The fact of the matter is that the candle consists of both the oil and the wick [producing] two types of light: a darkened light directly on the wick, and the clarified white light</em>. (<em>Torah Or</em>, Miketz 33a)</p>
<p>This differentiation serves as a springboard for a discourse upon two pathways in religious life. It is possible, to a certain extent, to posit that the discourse is the product of the Admor ha-Zaken’s own meditation upon the different colors of light in the candle’s flame, and without that, there would be no discourse to speak of.</p>
<p><sup> </sup>The motif of the candle, especially the imaginings it conjures, are a frequent theme in scripture and in rabbinic writing &#8211; <em>mitzvah candle</em>; <em>candle of the soul</em>; <em>candle of God</em>. Thereby, leading many Hasidic discourses to seek explanations of the relationship between the soul, the commandments, and God. Most importantly, in our study of the discourse of the Admor ha-Zaken, we will encounter the tension between the godly and the commanded &#8211; the infinitude of the divine as opposed to the borders, limits, and finitude of the system of commandments.</p>
<p>However, prior to doing so, we will focus our attention for a moment on the tension between the soul and the commandment &#8211; the internal spiritual life of the believer relative to the externalized performance of the commandment.</p>
<p>The emergence of Hasidism brought to the fore the following challenge: does the fact of an increased individual emphasis upon internal spiritual life mean that a person will, of necessity, distance himself from the practical framework of halakha? In a different formulation, does the focus of Hasidism upon the ‘soul-candle’ mean that the light of the ‘commandment-candle’ will be dimmed?</p>
<p>The tension between the two is clear: one’s obligation to do specific things affixed to specific times stands in opposition to one’s attunement with and attention to their own inner voice. Our own eyes see, and not just in connection with Jewish religious life, that when one follows his own personal truth, he does not behave according to the dictates and accepted norms of society at large. For example, one who desires to be ‘more authentic’ may be less polite, as the rules of etiquette are seen as external social constructions that dull one’s inner life. Similarly, for this type of individual, when it comes to halakha, it will be approached and understood as a system that holds him back from his own truth, and not only that, but it sometimes will be perceived as a lie. From a halakhic point of view, he must pray at specifically ordained times, but in his heart of hearts he knows that right now his prayers will not be fully sincere, but rather just going through the motions. Must this individual now answer the external call to prayer, or should they rather hold fast to their inner calling, thereby relaxing the connection to the outer halakhic reality?</p>
<p>In truth, this question has yet another dimension with which we may be able to sharpen our understanding &#8211; the chasm between objective and subjective experience.</p>
<p>Should an individual seek out the truth through their own subjective experience, or should they rather find it in the absolutist objective realm of reality? Once a person apprehends the truth as a construction of their own subjective internal experience, the concept of truth loses its totality and becomes relativized. Truth instead becomes dependent upon one’s specific perspective, their emotions, feelings, and personal experiences. In this sense, halakha is identified with the absolute and fixed sphere of reality &#8211; within which God commanded us, and this type of relativism is untenable in relation to it.</p>
<p>It is possible to argue that the ideal state is when the internal, personal truth is parallel with the objective, external truth.<a href="index.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The meaning of this situation is that on one hand, the individual’s internal life burns strongly, and because of this his sense of obligation to this inwardness  is unassailable. This leads to a perspective where the inner life is understood as objective reality, absolute. A person in this type of situation loses their sense of relativity and their inner directives obtain the strength of an outside command, possessing no less force of obligation or truth.</p>
<p>The problem with the situation within which we live is that our inner lives lack strength and force. Our inner lives are prone to ups and downs, steps forward and back. Because of the dullness of our internal lives, they are susceptible to all kinds of outside influences, and thus there is a subsequent lack of authenticity. This is the reason the <em>Shulhan Arukh</em> &#8211; not internal spirituality &#8211; is the basis for our religious obligations, as the absolute cornerstone of our lives.</p>
<p>To be sure, divine truth is revealed on a number of different levels and planes in our lives. An individual is forbidden to think that truth is obtainable only in one dimension, either in the internal or external life alone. An encompassing, total reality takes both our internal and external lives into account and unifies them. However, in our incomplete, non-ideal reality, to every dimension and perspective there are benefits and detriments, in which we ignore either at our own peril. To this end, our rabbis taught us that we must serve God through both fear and love: <em>and so Hazal said, serve out of fear, serve out of love</em>.<a href="index.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Admor ha-Zaken</strong></p>
<p>Until now, we have seen the tension between the <em>mitzvah</em> candle and the <em>neshamah (soul)</em> candle, to wit &#8211; the conflict between the formal halakhic system and the unmediated spirituality sought by Hasidism, a spirituality that nevertheless has as a central prerequisite the authenticity of action. Thus, authenticity stands in opposition to the fact that the believer stands commanded to perform certain actions at appointed, limited times.</p>
<p>In his discourse for Hanukkah, Admor ha-Zaken deals with yet another tension addressed by Hasidism, especially in the system of Habad Hasidism: What is the connection of physical actions &#8211; the performance of the commandments &#8211; with the metaphysical, spiritual payoff that they are supposed to engender, such as an attainment of closeness with God?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commandments, as they are sensed and experienced through action, are part of the world of tangibility [יש] &#8211; the finite and created human reality. Therefore, what connection can these have with faith in the divine infinity?</p>
<p>As it appears to me, the movement of the Admor ha-Zaken is a dialectical approach. On the one hand, he presents the commandments in a strictly utilitarian manner without any truly inherent value, but on the other, this very physicality of the commandments in our reality that which accords to them their roots in the pure divine will:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It is written: ‘A mitzvah is a candle and the Torah is Light.’ The mitzvot are called ‘candle.’ And it is also written: ‘the candle of God is the soul of man’, that the soul is called ‘candle’. The Zohar explained that the mitzvot are called ‘garments’&#8230; and in order to be fully clothed, the soul must fulfill all 613 mitzvot… The soul’s garments… are explained as boundless illuminations… for there are countless understandings of the light and the glow, which is an emanation of the infinite light, Blessed be He…</em></p>
<p><em>The delights that derive from the infinite light, which is the source of all delights, are without end. Similarly, we perceive with our senses… that physical delights are also without measure, for there are infinite ways to experience pleasure… Because of this, the soul as an aspect of the finite is unable to fully apprehend the revelation of this glow, which is the very being of the divine, except through a garment &#8211; a filter – [The soul] is only able to receive the light and the glow through that garment and filter.</em><em> (</em><em>Torah Or</em>, Miketz, 32d)</p></blockquote>
<p>The soul requires ‘garments’, for without these garments and filters, there is no comprehension. I will try to explain what I mean here. For example, when we speak of an eternal remembrance of a person’s life, are we talking about transcribing the details of a person’s life, as if entering a transcription of reporter’s notes into a computer? Of course not! All these moments of a person’s life are mere garments, a medium for <em>the real</em> that occurred in them. This <em>real </em>is not something specific, not a definable factor, but rather is the thing that grants meaning to the content of those experiences, even though it itself is undefinable.<a href="index.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Thus, ‘eternal life’ is life that retains with it the meaning of these experiences &#8211; something which can never be quantified or simply entered into a computer.</p>
<p>This undefinable thing that grants meaning, and is the life-force to everything else, is what Admor ha-Zaken calls the ‘glow of the infinite light’. It is not simply ‘meaning’, but rather the ‘meaning of all meaning’. In the discourse before us, as well as in other discourses of his, Admor ha-Zaken draws a connection and equivalence between this glow and the delight and pleasure that in our world always appears via a medium, some physical object. Pleasure will never materialize in this world in its pure state &#8211; <em>like delight in the earthly realm that always devolves from something outside it, like when we take pleasure in some delicious food or in the study of some wisdom</em>. (R. Schneur Zalman <em>Likkutei Torah</em>, addenda to <em>Parshat Vayikra</em>, 52a)</p>
<p>If so, the commandments are garments through which our world obtains its substance, existence, and meaning. In the language of Admor ha-Zaken, the commandments act as a conduit for the infinite light to penetrate into our world. That is to say, the commandments as an entire system of life form a space within which a person may experience the Eros of true meaning. Through them, an individual may feel alive, that is sensations of satisfaction, excitement, longing, the joy of commandment, and intimacy &#8211; all these we may incorporate metonymically into the word ‘light’ or ‘holiness’, that which Admor ha-Zaken would call ‘delight’ or ‘pleasure’.</p>
<p>In order for this light to be apprehended, it must be arrayed in the outer garments of the commandments. This is to say, that the commandments themselves are not the essence of the light and delight, nor are they the meaningful point of existence, but rather only a garment, that receives its light only by dint of the subjective experience of holiness and pleasure felt through it.As Admor ha-Zaken explains in the discourse we are studying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Behold, it is not the way of the divine infinite light to be infused in the mitzvot</em> <em>unless it is through… the Godly soul itself that performs the mitzvah, and thereby draws forth through them a revelation of the divine infinite light. As it is written:</em> <em>“that the individual shall perform them” &#8211; the individual makes them into mitzvot, in drawing forth through them the infinite light</em>.<em> (</em><em>Torah Or</em>, Miketz.33c)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Source of the Commandments</strong></p>
<p>To be sure, it is possible to say that any way of life or cultural system is but a garment for the infinite light, in that, the system bears the weight of the meaning of life and the essence of reality. An individual experiences his or her life through cultural constructs and the social systems &#8211; especially the most critical ones such as love, longing, lower and higher fears, loyalty, etc. All these things grant to life meaning and purpose, something we would not trade for anything.</p>
<p>Hasidic thought recognizes this truth as related to the fact that the world was created through “ten utterances” through which the divine light is revealed even without a specifically <em>religious language</em>, such as the Ten Commandments. Yet according to Admor ha-Zaken, there remains a difference between these [human] systems and the system of the commandments, even if the commandments are a ‘human system’, in that, they devolved into [a human form] from their ideal original rootedness in the infinite reality.</p>
<p>At this point, Admor ha-Zaken ceases to see the commandments as merely a garment or tool alone, but rather that they themselves represent constitute a direct encounter with the presence of the divine in our reality. This is to say that the commandments are a system meant to signify and symbolize the infinite itself.<a href="index.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> They do not simply give expression to it, but direct us to it as well.</p>
<p>How do the commandments symbolize? As a system, they point to the divine will itself, as a closed system, without determination or purpose. One might even say that the symbol does not signify something that we are meant to understand, but rather that the signified is incomprehensibility itself, the ‘<em>void within the void</em>’.</p>
<p>In order to understand these things, we must pay attention to the distinction that Admor ha-Zaken makes between “the infinite light” and the “essential will of the infinite light”.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It is impossible for the essential will of the infinite light to be revealed to any created being, unless that divine will is embodied in some physical act, which are the performance of the mitzvah… The root of the mitzvot is very lofty, rooted in the uppermost realms of the supernal crown, keter&#8230; until it devolves into our realm through physical actions and things, tzitzit and sukkah, specifically in these things that the divine will is revealed, as‘the final in action is first in thought’.  </em><em>In action, heaven was [created] first&#8230; but in thought, physicality came first&#8230; for the light is revealed from the aspect of divinity that encompasses all realms&#8230; </em></p>
<p><em>Thus the performance of mitzvot, whose roots lie in this encompassing aspect of divinity &#8211; the supernal keter &#8211; cannot be expressed below in the aspect of ‘inner light’, but rather must find their expression in exterior, physical actions, as it is well known that that which in its essence is loftier and elevated falls to the deeper depths.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, through the performance of mitzvot, there is created a covering, an encompassing screen, so that through the mitzvot the [soul] may be able to delight in the delight of the infinite light…</em><em>    (Torah Or</em>, Miketz. pp. 32d-33a)</p></blockquote>
<p>Admor ha-Zaken presents the commandments as having a dual character. As a garment, they are only a vessel through which the infinite divine light finds expression. They are the delight of the soul, holiness in which all that is perceived is as the essence of this world. The commandments themselves are not the inner aspect of life but rather a medium for this interiority.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Admor ha-Zaken identifies them with the ‘encompassing’ lights (<em>makifim,</em> מקיפים); a reality that cannot be truly apprehended or experienced within ours. The root of the commandments are as vessels, conduits of a reality beyond ours &#8211; ‘the essential will of the infinite light’.</p>
<p>This idea shows a classic HaBaD teaching, which Admor ha-Zaken formulates thusly: <em>that which in its essence is loftier and elevated falls to the deeper depths</em>. We locate the root of the commandments, which in reality are purely utilitarian and without their own essential, inherent meaning, in the very essence and core of the divine.</p>
<p>The claim of Admor ha-Zaken is that the source of the commandments is to be found in the divine will itself. The meaning of the commandments is not resolved through adhering to some system of rules, some ethical or moral ideal, or some historical-progressive idea through which they were conceived.<a href="index.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> In the most simple sense, God <em>wanted </em>commandments, and through this there developed a system with meaning and sense, which we might call <em>wisdom,</em> but that system does not fully define the Will of the creator, nor is it <em>necessary </em>in the absolute sense.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned discourse, Admor ha-Zaken teaches that the actual final action precedes the first thought, which explains and gives the action meaning. In actuality, the physical performance of the commandments is connected to the Divine Will. This warrants it to be done this particular way and not differently, without any humanly discernible reason.</p>
<p>This is the way of the Divine Will, to <em>desire </em>without dependence upon any externally motivating factor. One might say that since they are grounded in the Divine Will, the commandments <em>as such </em>signify a degree of arbitrariness and happenstance.<a href="index.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>  The commandments serve as a reminder of the ultimate unknowability of the Divine Will that tautologically ‘desires because it desires’.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why the commandments primarily take the form of actions and not intentions. As actions, the commandments present themselves as opaque objects. They are independent of their meanings and reasons, of the light and the delight that we grasp through them.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Thus a reduce conflict between the soul-life and the practical-life. See further <em>torah </em>no. 33 in <em>Lectures on Likkutei Moharan</em> vol. 1, 295-310; <em>torah </em>no. 6, 68.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Commentary of R. Ovadia Bartenura on the Mishnah, Avot 1:3. I will point out, however, that it is basically impossible to impose upon someone a completely external commandment. Therefore, even the ability to follow an external command is a matter of personal prerogative, related to the realm of personal freedom. This is to say that the internality of a person itself transitions between many different phases &#8211; sometimes appearing as the freedom to be unfree, limited, and inauthentic.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> We must differentiate between ‘sense’ and ‘meaning’ [English in the original; JR]. As we shall soon see, ‘the glow of the infinite’ is what gives ‘sense’ to ‘meaning’. ‘Sense’ is completely attached to the level of content &#8211; words, actions, situations. ‘Meaning’ is the internal, animating force behind these, granting these things spiritual ‘weight’.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This may be likened to the Lacanian idea of the<em> real</em>.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The position of the Admor ha-Zaken here parallels in a certain sense the positions of Yeshayahu Leibowitz with regards to the commandments.

				<p>Jews have lived in prosperity and security in the United States for 362 years. American Jews have felt a special gratefulness for the opportunities of American life. This year, I offer a 1905 service for the Sabbath before Thanksgiving written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Pereira_Mendes">Rev H. Pereira Mendes </a>of the Spanish- Portuguese synagogue of NY. The prayer and its sentiment may be needed more than ever this year as a reminder of our best aspirations for this country.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;O Lord, look down from Thy holy habitation from heaven and bless this Republic.. May it advance from strength to strength and continue to be a refuge for all who seek its shelter&#8230; May they be ever mindful that the blessings of liberty are safeguarded by obedience to law&#8230;&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A few years ago I posted the Thanksgiving service from the <a href="../../../../2009/11/23/service-for-thanksgiving-day-1945-rabbi-david-de-sola-pool/index.html">Spanish Portuguese Synagogue of NY from 1945.</a> Then I posted the service from <a href="../../../../2014/11/22/service-for-thanksgiving-day-1940-rabbi-joseph-lookstein/index.html">Kehilath Jeshurun 1940 and prayer from Rabbi Joseph Lookstein</a>. Lookstein&#8217;s prayer was exceptionally universal and was picked up by <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/a-thanksgiving-prayer/article/820172">several widely read online sites</a> as a wonderful universal prayer- ideal for Thanksgiving reading.</p>
<p>This year, I am posting the service and prayer for the Sabbath before Thanksgiving that was offered in Carnegie Hall at a special convocation to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the settlement of Jews in the United States.</p>
<p>The event was a broad community event with parallel events in many cities such as Boston and Philadelphia.  Rev Pereira Mendes lead the service and his prayer is below . <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9502E3DE1438EF32A25755C2A9679D946497D6CF">His sermon exhorted his listeners</a> not to give up their Judaism in the midst of the American acceptance. Rev Pereira Mendes spoke on a Judaism of reverence, righteousness and responsibility.  Newspaper reporter were asked not to write during he service since it was the Sabbath. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E7DC153AE733A25752C0A9649D946497D6CF">The mayors of NYC and Philadelphia </a>attended as did former President Grover Cleveland, a letter was sent to be read by President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>There was also a Reform service at Temple Emanu-El with a more naturalistic prayer by Rev Joseph Silverman. There was also a large celebration at the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A03EFD81738EF32A25753C3A9629C946497D6CF">Savoy hotel for the wealthy donors.</a> The volume has a superb speech on integration in the US by Sephardic Dr. Solomon Soils-Cohen, whose family settled in the United Stated in colonial times.  The volume is available on <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000315423">online in many forms.</a></p>

<p>O Lord, our God, God of our fathers, Ruler of nations, we worship Thee and praise Thy Name for Thy mercy and for Thy truth. On this day of our rejoicing we will make mention of Thy loving kindness according to all that Thou hast bestowed on us and we will proclaim Thy great goodness toward the house of Israel. For Thou didst say, Surely they are My people, children that will not deal falsely; so Thou hast been our Savior</p>
<p>Throughout the past ages Thou hast carried Israel as on eagles&#8217; wings. From the bondage of Egypt, through the trials of the wilderness, Thou didst bring us and didst plant us in the land which Thou didst choose. In the sorrows of Babylon, Thy love and pity redeemed us; and when dispersed in every land, Thy Divine presence accompanied us in every affliction. Yea, when we passed through the waters, Thou wast with us, and through the rivers, they did not overflow us; when we walked through fire, we were not burned. From nation to nation Thou didst lead us, until the hand of the oppressor was weakened and the day of human rights began to dawn. Wherever we found a resting place, and built Thee a sanctuary, Thou didst dwell in our midst, and cleaving unto Thee, O Lord, we are alive this day&#8217;</p>
<p>We thank Thee that Thou hast sustained us unto this day, and that in the fullness of Thy mercy Thou hast vouchsafed to us of the seed of Israel a soil on which to grow strong in freedom and in fidelity to Thy truth. Thou hast opened unto us this blessed haven of our beloved land. Everlasting God, in whose eyes a thousand years are as yesterday which is past and as a watch of the night, we lift up our hearts in gratitude to Thee, in that two hundred and fifty years ago Thou didst guide a little band of Israel’s children who, . seeking freedom to worship Thee, found it in a land which, with Thy blessing, became a refuge of freedom and justice for the oppressed of all peoples. We thank Thee that our lot has fallen in pleasant places. Verily, O Lord God of Israel, Thou hast given rest unto Thy people, rest from our sorrow&#8217;, and from the hard bondage wherein we were made to serve.</p>
<p>O Lord, look down from Thy holy habitation from heaven and bless this Republic. Preserve it in the liberty which has been proclaimed in the land, and in the righteousness which is its foundation. Bless it with prosperity and peace. May it advance from strength to strength and continue to be a refuge for all who seek its shelter. Imbue all its citizens with a spirit of loyalty to its ideals. May they be ever mindful that the blessings of liberty are safeguarded by obedience to law, and that the prosperity of the nation rests upon trust in Thy goodness and reverence for Thy commandments.</p>
<p>Bless the President and his counselors, the judges, lawgivers, and executives of our county. Put forth upon them the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and the spirit of might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. May America become a light to all peoples, teaching the world that righteousness exalteth a nation.</p>
<p>Our Father in Heaven, Who lovest all nations, all men are Thy children. Thou dost apportion tasks to peoples according to their gifts of mind and heart. But all, are revealing Thy marvelous plans for mankind. May the day speedily dawn when Thy kingdom will be established on earth, when nations shall learn war no more, when peace shall be the crowning reward of a world redeemed by justice, and all men shall know Thee, from the greatest unto the least.</p>
<p>Then shall loving kindness and truth meet, righteousness and peace kiss each other, truth spring forth from earth and righteousness look down from heaven. May all hearts serve Thee with one accord and recognize that Thou art One and Thy Name is One.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Dear Prof Brill,</p>
<p>I have read with great interest <a href="../../../../2016/11/07/jack-bieler-the-great-principle-of-the-torah-and-discussion-of-dov-weiss-rav-shagar-jewish-education-and-modern-orthodoxy/index.html">your interview with Rabbi Jack Bieler</a>, as well as his 2008 article from which you extracted a number of key statements of principles. My view on these educational issues is that of a client, namely, through the years I have been a student in a Hebrew Day School, and a parent and grandparent (I still have three grandchildren in K–12) of children in Modern Orthodox schools.</p>
<p>There is hardly a sentiment expressed by Rabbi Bieler with which I disagree. In fact, they are all extremely admirable. But I would like to comment on their contending with the realities on the ground.</p>
<p>On Rabbi Bieler’s remarks about guarding against isolationist tendencies: If a couple invests economically (that includes real estate, food, schooling), socially, and emotionally to live the Modern Orthodox life we live, it is hard to realistically expect that a sense of uniqueness and, hopefully, excellence will not emerge from such a family life. With nothing intended, such a singular life-style produces a certain exclusivity by the very excellence it aspires to and achieves. Decency, respect, and compassion, for others are sure to be taught in the home and the school, but do not be surprised – especially, if everyone with whom children interact are from our own Modern Orthodox society – if we get unexpected results when our students emerge from our cocoon. To illustrate at a small-scale anecdotal level: I recall that in my day, nearly all our general studies teachers were non-Orthodox, Jew or Gentile; so we had to learn at a very early stage to interact properly with people who were not our own. When I met such people later on, outside my own environment, there was no break with my previous experience. So maybe the current emphasis on general studies teachers who are Orthodox, and thereby can serve as “role models,” comes with an unintended price</p>
<p>Why did <i>Torah im Derekh Eretz</i>, fail? The original ideology presupposed a broad society of educated and cultured people in European civilization. That has been gone for quite awhile, now. For one thing, the kind of education envisioned in the ideology of <i>Torah im Derekh Eretz</i> required mastery of foreign languages. Those university departments, along with classical civilization departments, have been dwindling – if not closing – throughout the United States for four decades. For another, history and literature departments have been politicized by the progressive polemic against the white, male, Eurocentric culture. (That includes, of course, the Founding Fathers of the United States.) My guess is that, today, any university professor casually referring to a classical text, or to Milton, Locke, and James, would be met with blank stares <i>– </i>unless in an advanced literature class – the same as students’ blank stares, years ago, when<i> </i>Rav Lichtenstein, <i>zt”l </i>mentioned such authors. As to music, to take a another example, symphonies and operas across the country are under the same pressures as traditional humanities departments. The popular music culture of the past fifty years is not the high culture imagined by Rabbi Samson R. Hirsch in his time, nor by the remaining <i>Torah im Derekh Eretz</i> advocates of our time.</p>
<p>Our current university students are caught in an almost intolerable situation. The humanities and the sciences – beyond medicine and technological uses of the computer sciences and engineering – that were broadly attractive to my generation and the one following, are no longer attractive. So the choice is either the multicultural polemic against the West that has overtaken the universities, or the retreat to professional-prep curricula. Is it small wonder that <i>Torah im Derekh Eretz </i>has failed, and students “have taken a rightward turn?”</p>
<p>Why did <i>Torah u’Madda</i> fail to carry the day? Most people do not live philosophically driven lives. Orthodox Jews are, first and foremost, traditional. When I grew up, Orthodoxy was neither a philosophy nor an ideology. It basically meant being observant of the <i>mitzvot</i>, in contrast to the Conservative and Reform. What has morphed into Modern Orthodoxy today was, back then,<i> ba’ale-batish</i>–no ideological/philosophical pretenses attached. Modern Orthodox ideology currently focuses on the legal (halakhic), historical, and philosophical/spiritual aspects of Judaism to provide an answer to the contemporary situation. But current discussions studiously ignore the anthropology, the mythic structure of the personality – imbedded in one’s DNA from birth, as it were – bequeathed by a tradition of about 3500 years starting with <i>Avraham Avinu, </i>and by the founding myth of peoplehood some 210 years later, the Exodus from Egypt.</p>
<p>Modern life, indeed, challenges the traditional one as it emphasizes among other matters the individual at the expense of, in our case, the covenantal community. But, unless educational and developmental emphases strengthen the traditional life at the anthropological level, the tradition will devolve willy-nilly to a cultural option, to a lifestyle choice, parallel to the spirit of Rabbi Bieler’s remarks about Rabbi Shagar’s post-modernism.</p>
<p>Moreover, contemporary economic pressures mitigate against the luxury of a philosophically driven life. Just do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the cost of 14 years of K–13 (13 represents the year in Israel) of instruction, along with summer camps, elevated cost-of-living with regard to food and real estate. After that, it cannot be realistically expected that many parents have the time and energy to articulate a philosophy of life for themselves and to their children.</p>
<p>Also, traditional Torah study of the <i>halakhah,</i> that kind of <i>limud haTorah b’omek</i>in which Rav Soloveitchik <i>zt”l</i> found religious inspiration, is not part of the Modern Orthodox religious ethos – even if contending with the data of the <i>halakhah</i> is integral to its social program. So Rabbi Bieler’s disappointment, with  those in Yeshiva University’s cultural orbit who did not respond to the Rov’s philosophical endeavors, has its mirror-image disappointment on the other side of the cultural divide in Modern Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Lip-service is definitely given in Modern Orthodoxy to mastery of texts, and no small amount of effort goes into them. But there is no question that students emerge from a K–13 education without fluent mastery of the two languages of the tradition – Hebrew and Aramaic. One can take a course in a foreign language at a university, and at 3 hrs/week and 15 weeks/semester, for 4 semesters, and command the language up to, say, some elementary poetry in those two years. But how many students emerge from 14 years of  Modern Orthodox education able to study a <i>masekhta</i>, with <i>gemara </i>and <i>Rashi</i>, on their own or with <i>chevrusa</i> without an English translation with commentary? How many students are comfortable studying <i>Chumash</i> with the classical commentaries? Let’s make it easier. How many students interested in <i>TaNaKH</i> will read the Israeli <i>hesder</i> books, for example, those written in accessible Hebrew by Rabbis Yoel Bin-Nun, Yuval Cherlow, and Elchanan Samet, rather than wait for the English translations to appear? One must ask, in addition, as to how much higher the percentage among those who attended Yeshiva University after high school. Walk into a Modern Orthodox synagogue Shabbat morning, and survey people’s reading material <i>a.k.a.</i>“survival kits” (that in itself is for another discussion). How much will be in Hebrew and how much in English?</p>
<p>In the discussion of philosophical commitment to Modern Orthodoxy, you excerpted from Rabbi Bieler’s article the following assumption:</p>
<p>The awareness that participation within general human society will entail encountering manifold situations that are not clearly delineated within the Codes of Jewish law and other primary texts of our tradition. Therefore in order for the Modern Orthodox Jew to act consistently in accordance with Jewish values and tradition in situations that are either unprecedented or where he does not have the time to be able to direct inquiries to halakhic authorities, he will have to possess a sense of not only how to carry out individual Commandments, but also the overall philosophy, theology and worldview that underlie these Commandments, which in turn will develop within him an almost instinctual awareness as to how to act Jewishly a times when no authoritative religious guidance is available to him.</p>
<p>In all candor, the current skill set in the foundational texts among current students – not just the data, but the process and intuition as well – is insufficient for any significant percentage to have developed beyond their formal instruction to achieve “an almost instinctual awareness as to how to act Jewishly a times when no authoritative religious guidance is available.” Rabbi Bieler has set a very high bar, and it is most important that he articulated it; but is it extremely difficult to imagine its realization beyond few exceptional adult individuals in our current religious culture.</p>
<p>Our educators, even with the very best of intentions, especially if they take to heart Rabbi Bieler’s shopping list, are simply overwhelmed by what they aim to accomplish. But for decades, now, Modern Orthodox education has devolved to prep-education for admission to the best universities, with the Jewish studies dedicated to giving students the wherewithal to remain loyal to the tradition upon entry to the wider world. This is not an indictment; it is what I see &#8220;on the ground.&#8221; When successful, this is no small achievement, and our educators can take genuine pride and satisfaction in their work. But the intellectual and spiritual creativity of the moment seem to be in society at large, and Modern Orthodox education is responding in the best way it can. Cherry-picking the sources of the <i>TaNaKH, ChaZaL</i>, and the rest of the literature that speak to the current situation is just that – current, at best. My sense is that there is a loss of  faith in the capacity of the classical texts of the tradition – the “sophisticated” as well as the “unsophisticated” sources – to inspire; that until such faith returns with the wherewithal to indeed inspire, Modern Orthodoxy will not be able to produce an ethic and ethos from within that genuinely produces the integration of particularist and universalist sensibilities to which it aspires.</p>

				<p>I received my copy of Rabbi Jack Bieler’s delightful new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Principle-Torah-Examining-Principles/dp/0692631569"><em>The Great Principle of the Torah</em> </a>(Kodesh Press, 2016) in the spring but did not review it at the time because the content was not sufficient for a long review, fitting in with this blog’s current style.  However, when I posted <a href="../../../../2016/09/06/interview-with-dov-weiss-pious-irreverence-confronting-god-in-rabbinic-judaism/index.html">my Interview with Dov Weiss on arguing</a> with God, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a response from Bieler. In the interim, I also received a response from Bieler concerning my <a href="../../../../2016/10/26/judaism-and-post-modernity-rabbi-shagar-in-english-translation/index.html">Rav Shagar post</a>. Together with quotes from his articles, it produced a fine post.</p>
<p>This post will be somewhat different than my ordinary post in that I will be more explicit in direct comments as a form of internal dialogue between ideal and reality and between different modes of thinking about religion and culture.  I am not aiming to critique Rabbi Bieler in any way, rather to work out in public some of the issues about Modern Orthodoxy. I have known Rabbi Bieler as an email confrere for almost fifteen years since the days of  the defunct EDAH. One can use this post as an insight into what one person from the Torah uMadda era envisioned. One can also use the post to evaluate why the intellectual and moral approach did not garner wide support leading to it being replaced by progressive social inclusion, halakhah as a closed discourse, community building and outreach, and popular culture- in both its open and right wing forms.  By the fourth question, we have Bieler’s own elegy for a path not taken.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jack Bieler founded <a href="https://www.kmsynagogue.org/rabbi-jack-bieler---our-founding-rabbi.html">Kemp Mill Synagogue </a>in Silver Spring, MD in 1990, where he served as spiritual leader until his retirement in 2015. He received ordination from Yeshiva University and was a faculty member of Yeshivat Ramaz and the Berman Hebrew Academy. He has a <a href="https://rayanotyaakov.wordpress.com/">website</a> that is worth reading for <a href="https://rayanotyaakov.wordpress.com/publications/">his archive of article</a>s. In addition, he sends out a daily <a href="https://rayanotyaakov.wordpress.com/jewish-year-5775/">dvar Torah article</a> on <a href="https://yaakovbieler.wordpress.com/">his blog.</a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Principle-Torah-Examining-Principles/dp/0692631569"><em>The Great Principle of the Torah</em>,</a> Rabbi Jack Bieler works from a fundamental belief in moral imperatives as the driving force in Judaism. This book deals with seven statements from the Talmud and presents the rabbinic positions on each principle together with further sources in the Biblical commentators, medieval and modern Jewish thought and connections to the Torah readings. In most of the chapters he also offers pedagogic advice and charts.</p>

<p>The seven principles are:<br />
1. Love they neighbor- Hillel’s opinion that “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.” This is a variation of the biblical: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”<br />
2. Universalism- Ben Azzai focused on the biblical statement “This is the book of the generations of man in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.”<br />
3. The concept of ever more concise Principles- prophet Habakkuk wrote “But the righteous shall live by his faith.”<br />
4. Everyday Consciousness -Bar Kappa’s “In all your ways know him and he will direct your paths.”<br />
5. Pleasantness and Peace- Rabbi Joseph “Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace.”<br />
6. Loving-kindness- Rabbi Yehudah emphasized kindness, for one who denies it “denies the most fundamental principle.”<br />
7. Lawfulness- Rabbi Elazar said: “The entire Torah is based upon justice.”</p>
<p>These principles are not to be seen as random quotes from the Aggadah, rather fundamental directives that, according to Bieler, should color one’s entire approach to Judaism above and beyond the halakhic or ritual obligations.</p>
<p>In the chapter on  Rabbi Joseph’s principle “the whole of the Law is also for the purpose of promoting peace, Bieler even considers whether Judaism’s legal character is an obstacle to pleasantness and peace. The chapter concludes by cautioning that “it is necessary for Jewish leaders to make absolutely certain that before they make a pronouncement that could have negative social consequences, they have exhausted all legitimate options to render a more inclusive or humane decision.”</p>
<p>Bieler concludes that the value of these principles is more in the reflection on what is involved in a Jewish religious life than in determining the application of principle, their study becomes more of an act of helping his students attain moral maturity than providing set answers. The book belongs in every Jewish high school and middle school library as well as in the synagogue; it is a goldmine for creating lesson plans and homiletic materials. I would have loved a book like this twenty-five years ago when I taught high school, where it would have been integrated into my Talmud and Bible lesson plans for the year.</p>
<p>Bieler’s thought is a synthesis of old school Torah uMadda with elements of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, musar movement, and Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, along with Lawrence Kohlberg, Robert Alter, Bibliodrama, and Robert Pirsig’s <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.</em> Those who still envision the possibilities of an educated and observant Jewish life should definitely buy the book and read it over a weekend for a vacation to an Orthodoxy that spoke of “meta-principles” and ethical vision. The book is stimulating and fruitful while at the same time returning to basics.</p>
<p>Now for my dialectic. Why did this approach not catch on? There contents and message of this book are similar to <a href="../../../../2016/07/27/in-his-image-an-interview-with-rabbi-yuval-cherlow/index.html">Rabbi Yuval Cherlow’s  recent work</a> on the need for human dignity and ethics ias well as developing a Torah humanism and Cherlow based his approach on the same principles. Bieler&#8217;s book may even be better grounded in the sources.</p>
<p>I do think that part of the answer for lack of resonance is that Rabbi Cherlow is in the newspapers and public functions every week dealing with a contemporary social and political questions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah_Umadda">Torah uMadda </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah_im_Derech_Eretz">Hirsch’s TIDYism</a> were  theologies for educators to develop virtue in their students and did not have a strong enough social element. For example, one does not see American Modern Orthodox leadership having much to say about the serious ethical issues of our day. In addition, there has been a shift to looking for fixed halakhic resolutions, rather than using a Hirschian or Kohlberg oriented moral training.  Why the professional community wanted this halakhic approach over the other is a bigger discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, there might have been a sense of the correctness on the part of the advocates of the Torah uMadda approach that did not feel the need to sell itself. For example, this book seems to be lecture notes for a high school class without concern for 21<sup>st</sup> century presentation. There are long textual quotes, separate discussions in the notes, and no index, as well as a lack of ethical discussion geared for an adult who is not an educator.</p>
<p>In order to further the discussion, let us turn to the email response I received from Rabbi Bieler after the post by Dov Weiss. (The question and answer format was added for the blog post.) In the response, one sees a Torah Umadda that seeks to integrate Jewish history and Jewish texts but without historicism and without considering different texts as alternatives to our presentism. At the same time this approach, assumes that Torah is sophisticated and moral, without leaving a way to directly confront or condemn the overwhelming amount of non-ethical and unsophisticated forms of Torah.</p>

<li><strong>How do you see a tension between academics and the classroom concerning the <a href="../../../../2016/09/06/interview-with-dov-weiss-pious-irreverence-confronting-god-in-rabbinic-judaism/index.html">recent book by Dov Weiss?</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Reading the<a href="../../../../2016/09/06/interview-with-dov-weiss-pious-irreverence-confronting-god-in-rabbinic-judaism/index.html"> book review and interview with Dov Weiss</a> on the occasion of the publication of <em>Pious Irreverence: Confronting God in Rabbinic Judaism</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016), in which evolving depictions of the Divine are attributed to various collections of Rabbinic literature written in different epochs, once again raised in my mind a conundrum that probably confounds at least some Orthodox Jewish day school educators and community Rabbis like myself.</p>
<p>I would just suggest that a less untraditional approach to &#8220;God&#8217;s erring and having to change His mind&#8221; would be a modeling of Divine Reevaluation or Self-Reckoning that could serve man well as a moral lesson.</p>
<p>In that sense,  <em>Pesikta Rabbati,</em> piska 44 on &#8220;Shuva Yisrael&#8221; describing God as having to model as an exemplar case of repentance (teshuva) that can be used in educationally  in order to encourage fearful Israel to emulate His example.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yosef Yehudah Bloch in <em>Shiurei Da&#8217;at </em>suggests, based on Rashi (Genesis 1:1), that the image in midrash of Divine repentance (teshuva) manifests that the workings of the world were recalibrated when man came on the scene, from the exclusive province of attribute of judgement (<em>middat hadin</em>), to the addition and precedence of the attribute of mercy (<em>middat harachamim). </em>This is a less radical approach than that advanced by Dov Weiss, but may be a point of view that will allow broad-minded traditionalists to &#8220;dance at both weddings,&#8221; at least for a little while longer.</p>
<p>For this very reason, I suggest a Katuv HaShlishi HaMachria Beineihem (fig., a third approach that can ameliorate the two extreme alternatives delineated above) as a means to resolve the tension.</p>
<p>Rabbinic sources themselves discuss a certain “plasticity” when it comes to how God intends to be viewed, not only in different historical contexts, but even during the same period of time. The various Names associated with and descriptions of God indicate how at different times, cGod deliberately assumes different modalities in His dealings with the world and mankind, e.g., a) “Elokim”—law and justice; b) “Yud-Keh-Vav-Keh” (the Tetragrammaton)—kindness and mercy; c) “ShaKai”—omnipotence; d) “Keil Kana”—jealous and vindictive; d) “Man of War”—Exodus 15:3; e) “Groom”—Jeremiah 2:2, etc.</p>
<p>To my mind, these varied guises constitute formats deliberately chosen by God in order to suit a particular time and place, rather than merely terminology attributed to Him by man due to fundamental changes in human beings’ conditions and attitudes, thereby allowing a more traditional, and nevertheless complex and sophisticated approach to thinking about God.</p>
<p>Consequently, with respect to a book like Dov Weiss’s volume, in the words of Michael Rosenak, the traditionalist will necessarily have to “translate” concepts from the world of academia into terminology and assumptions that will be appropriate for the traditional premises of the world that he inhabits.</p>
<p><strong>2) What is the tension of academic and classroom understandings of texts?</strong></p>
<p>As a serious student and teacher of Rabbinic sources, I feel responsible to familiarize myself with the state of research in the field. Yet at the same time, since I am not a university academic, I find myself wondering about the extent to which I can justify incorporating contemporary initiatives and discoveries within my presentations in the Modern Orthodox day school classroom and synagogue Beit Midrash, when presenting such material potentially could have adverse effects on the beliefs of my students.</p>
<p>Such concerns have been in the back of my mind for some time, but became starkly delineated at a conference that I attended several years ago.  In 2008, the Mandel Center for Studies in Jewish education at Brandeis University, hosted a series of presentations entitled “Teaching Rabbinic Literature,” part of a project called “The Initiative on Bridging Scholarship and Pedagogy in Jewish Studies.”</p>
<p>I clearly recall the point at which it became very obvious to me that there exists a significant difference in approach of the university and the day school, regarding research, learning and teaching.</p>
<p>At a session devoted to liturgy, when, following a most stimulating talk addressing the Biblical and Rabbinic sources that contributed to a particular prayer, the academic presenter was asked during the question-and-answer period, “How can we incorporate these ideas in our day school context where prayer is approached as an important part of students’ experiential educational experience?” The frank and direct response given by the scholar was: “My students’ religious outlook is not my concern and therefore I have nothing to say in this regard.”</p>
<p>Both the day school teacher and synagogue educator, as part of their job definitions, per force must take into consideration the manner in which students are likely to respond religiously to what is being taught. While I am not advocating that day school curricula and synagogue course material be deliberately made misrepresentative of contemporary thinking and research offered by experts in the field, to be indifferent to the ultimate effects of what is presented is, at least in my opinion, is inappropriate and even irresponsible for practitioners like myself.</p>
<p>Since I did not begin my Jewish education until my freshman year at Yeshiva College, I remember observing a similar dilemma with respect to how Judaic and general studies were being presented.   While certain educators modeled by their personal examples how Jewish thought and practice were able to not only co-exist with, but even complement the premises underlying general studies, there were virtually no curricular contexts in which these two subject areas were directly and formally brought to bear upon one another. Consequently, students, who were required to enroll in both Judaic and general studies courses, more often than not were left to their own devices to try to resolve what they often experienced as the “cognitive dissonance” between the ideas to which they were exposed first in the morning during Judaic studies, and then over the course of each afternoon, when general studies were pursued.</p>
<p>Those heavily involved in the humanities, as I was, acutely experienced the conflict of such assumptions. Some students dealt with the clashing postulates with which they were continually bombarded by engaging in strenuous exercises of compartmentalization, or what Erving Goffman has elegantly referred to as “dimming the lights.” Some students allowed one subject area to assume overriding precedence over the other, reducing the potentially challenging educational experience offered at Yeshiva U. to a monolithic one, comprised of either the “Yeshiva” or the “University.”</p>
<p>Other students grappled with the conflicts head-on, with many of these eventually giving up on the idea that the two realms could coexist within their minds and outlooks.</p>
<p>I felt then, and have continued to believe throughout my career in day school education and the synagogue rabbinate, that students and congregants must not only honestly be presented with such conflicts, but also with strategies for the resolution of at least some of the issues raised.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a similar process occurs for those who wish to remain informed regarding the state of a field like Rabbinic thought, but who are at the same time are concerned that their students and congregants will be unable to understand how to reconcile the apparent “dissonance” that almost inevitably arises when the frame of reference for ideas is a historical one that has resulted in significant changes regarding how God is perceived and described by human beings over time.</p>
<p><strong>3) Response to <a href="../../../../2016/10/26/judaism-and-post-modernity-rabbi-shagar-in-english-translation/index.html">Rabbi Shagar’s essay on Postmodernism</a></strong></p>
<p>My most fundamental concern with this chapter is what I consider an internal contradiction with respect to the terms that ShaGaR employs. On the one hand, he defines post-Modernity as a position “that denies that certitude is possible” as well as legitimizing “the freedom of the individual to establish himself and his values” (p. 2). But then he states that the key to a constructive approach to religion now entails an honest “accepting the yoke of Heaven” (p. 4).</p>
<p>If one cannot be certain of the components of a system, and he believes that he can establish any sort of identity and values for himself, then doesn’t the idea of “accepting the yoke of Heaven” become absurd? If one cannot be sure of the idea that Torah originates with some type of objective Revelation at Sinai of both a Written and Oral Tradition, what “yoke” becomes relevant? If one defines for himself whatever it is that he feels is sincere and freely accepted, then instead of self-sacrifice and self-abnegation in favor of the Revealed Will of some Higher Power that has seemed to go hand-in-hand with the religious lifestyle, a solipsistic system is substituted which one somehow has become convinced is synonymous with the Will of Heaven. Perhaps ShaGaR understands “the yoke of Heaven” differently; I would very much be interested in understanding what this connotes within his thinking.</p>
<p>Secondly, his invocation of Rav Kook as someone who “attempted to come to terms with modern culture” (p. 2), drawing upon “mysticism as the seed of religion” (p. 6) is certainly evocative, but, in my opinion, fails to take into consideration that R. Kook was at the same time a firm Halachist who could even be said to have tended towards the Chumra (stringency) end of the spectrum of staking out Halachic positions. I have long thought that this objective structure supplied an anchor to R. Kook that served as a check-and-balance to his profoundly creative and original ventures into trying to hammer out new approaches to religious observance and a relationship with God. It seems to me that based upon ShaGaR’s definitions of the premises of post-Modernity, such a dialectic is not possible.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in two contexts, ShaGaR references critics who have claimed that his approach will engender “nihilism” (p. 2, 5). While I agree that in the purest context, a disavowal of standard ideology in favor of striving to develop a personal, sincere relationship with God would be ideal and the furthest thing from nihilistic, it seems to me that an unavoidable nihilistic result would be to reduce the observant community as a whole, fractured as it might be currently, to an even looser collection of individuals who each possess a unique and “boutique” perspective on Jewish observance.</p>
<p>Finally, the “devil is always in the details” and ShaGaR mentions as an educational means for addressing the issues he raises in a post-Modern world, a Chassidic existential position (p. 3), and Haredi education “built from identity and not ideology” (p. 4). Diagnosing a problem is one thing; addressing how to effectively cope with it and even use it to improve what currently exists is quite another, and I for one would be very curious to learn why and how he feels such approaches could make a significant difference.</p>
<p><strong>4) Why do you think Torah uMadda lost in hearts and minds of the congregants?  What could have been done differently that might have changed the trajectory of Modern Orthodox history?</strong></p>
<p>At the outset, I think that it is important to acknowledge that there are numerous reasons why Torah u’Madda has failed to capture the imaginations of contemporary American Modern Orthodoxy. Depending upon the frame of reference that one prefers, sociological, historical, psychological, epistemological, and theological reasons could all be brought to bear. Perhaps, as in so many areas of human existence, in order to gain as complete a picture as possible—an “eclectic” must be assembled comprised of the accounts of different individuals who each will be able to develop his/her own particular perspective regarding  the issue at hand.</p>
<p>Having spent my working life as a religious educator in day schools and synagogues, I tend to view this, and many other issues, both religious and secular, in educational terms, once again realizing that my figurative “myopia” in this regard can’t possibly capture all of the dimensions of the issue being considered.</p>
<p>Consequently, I have tended in my own thinking to attribute the ultimate failure of Torah u’Madda to the inability of Modern Orthodoxy’s key educational institutions, Yeshiva University in particular, to self-consciously produce individuals committed to such an outlook and who are aspiring to leadership and influence in the community’s key institutions, i.e., its synagogues and day schools.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have not found there to be a significant group of fellow-travelers who personally strive to model a Torah u’Madda philosophy in their professional and personal lives. While at times specific individuals have emerged from the community’s schooling system who exemplify a Torah u’Madda approach, there never have been enough of them who by serving as community Rabbis and day school teachers, could by their examples and teaching, influence a broad swath of people to become committed to such an outlook. One can argue that charismatic teachers and Rabbis cannot be made to order; however, I believe that, at least currently, neither thought has been given nor concerted effort made to encourage the production of a critical mass of such individuals who in turn would be able to set a tone for both professionals and laymen presently referring to themselves as Modern Orthodox.</p>
<p>In another educational vein, even the structure by which Jewish education is delivered, beginning when subject areas are departmentalized in Jewish day schools, usually during Middle School years, countermands the development of a Torah u’Madda approach. Torah u’Madda is by definition an interdisciplinary approach, whereby elements of Jewish tradition and general studies are brought to bear upon one another. However, over the course of a departmentalized school day, not only are, e.g., English and TaNaCh, History and Talmud, Hebrew language and French, Mathematics and Jewish thought, usually presented in splendid isolation from one another, but even the subjects within the Judaic studies and general studies curriculum are rarely allowed to interact within the classroom. While occasionally, some teachers may personally be conversant with “both sides of the curriculum,” the need to cover ground in the highly pressurized context of a double curriculum educational setting, usually precludes them from regularly incorporating “outside” ideas and thoughts into the classroom context.</p>
<p>Extra-curricular activities and experiences in youth groups and summer camps have focused upon affective rather than cognitive aspects of Jewish thinking, and therefore have not promoted a Tora U’Madda outlook.</p>
<p>Returning to the post-secondary educational scene, as well as the training of future congregational Rabbis and day school teachers, R. Aharon Lichtenstein, Z”L, a powerful exemplar of Torah u’Mada both by personal example as well in his teaching and writing, once commented that university education for many Modern Orthodox Jews has become the study of “sophisticated plumbing,” I.e., vocational training rather than an exploration and quest to better understand the human condition. Such a relatively narrow approach to the college learning experience, was clearly evident to me with respect to many of R. Aharon’s own Talmud students. During the time that I was a member of his Talmud class as an undergraduate at Yeshiva during 1968-9, Rav Aharon would often quote from various classical literary sources during the course of his presentations, something that I particularly admired, but also felt did not “register” all that much with most of my fellow students.</p>
<p>The essential dismissal of his citations from, e.g., Milton, Locke and James, took on even sharper focus, when, during a Sabbatical in Israel twenty years later, I attended his weekly Shiurim at the Gruss Institute in Jerusalem, a Kollel for YU Semicha students (candidates for Rabbinic ordination). When R. Aharon would, as his wont, cite some great secular thinker, I noted that the students would often look at one another and smile, saying, things like “There he goes again,” in a respectful, but clearly dismissive fashion. To my mind, this indicated that while they deeply respected and recognized R. Aharon’s extraordinary breadth of knowledge and powers of analysis, it was his Torah erudition that they cared about, not the dimension of his thinking regarding the giants of Western culture, which I certainly continue to believe, contributed mightily to his overall spiritual personality and Weltanschaung.</p>
<p>I believe that a similar phenomenon could be observed with respect to R. Aharon’s father-in-law, R. Soloveitchik, Z”L.  The Rav’s broad understanding of subject areas that included philosophy, literature, and theology were never broached within the context of the Semicha classes that I attended, and one only became apprised of the extent of his familiarity with these subject areas while listening to various talks that he gave to other groups, or reading particular sets of his writings.</p>
<p>If even the students exposed to great individuals like the Rav and R. Aharon, were inspired to emulate only their Torah learning, but not also their broad familiarity with secular ideas and culture, it seems to me that it should not come as a surprise why Torah uMadda has not become the sine qua none of Modern Orthodox American Jewry.</p>
<p>[AB- site editor] <strong>Now my dialectic kicks in again. I wonder how this might have been the fault of the Torah uMadda followers themselves? </strong>In the 1990’s, there were several score of rabbis and teachers who advocated Torah uMadda ready to ascend to the leadership positions that they assumed were destined to be theirs. What happened? Were they too introvert and cerebral? Were they just lacking political and leadership skills? Was the Torah that they were teaching irrelevant? Or did they just think that the future was already theirs so they did not have to fight for spiritual control of the community? I know many rabbis who are not comfortable with either the current YU Orthodoxy or with Open Orthodoxy and yearn for their 1986 or 1994 Torah uMadda vision. Do the answers above give clues to the change?</p>
<p><strong>Modern Orthodox Jewish Education (my voice)</strong></p>
<p>Maybe Jack Bieler’s article below may help. It is his 2008 “<a href="https://rayanotyaakov.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/2008-vision-of-a-modern-orthodox-jewish-education.pdf">Vision of a Modern Orthodox Jewish Education”</a> (Mandel Leadership Institute) where he offers an ideal vision of a day school education. I would like my readers who are educators to read it.  It is a wonderful essay that did not get the attention it deserved. First, he advocates an integrated approach like Hirsch’s Frankfort HS, in which the general studies teachers such as biology, English, and history are able to be religious Jews who can model integration. Second, education should be a midwifing of the students to find their own selves and voices, not worksheets and memorization.</p>
<p>Bieler gives eight aspirations of an integrated education that includes moral education, God in our lives, religion as part of broader culture and civilization, contribution to the quality of the wider culture, the need for spiritual reflection, to understand that answers will not come from fixed halakha but from creating an  overall philosophy, theology and worldview that will develop within the student an almost instinctual awareness as to how to act, reflection on rote practice, and to combat the natural human tendency to differentiate oneself from other- both Jewish and non-Jewish- through constantly being on guard against socially disruptive isolationist tendencies. The list is part Hirschian, part Victorian, and part similar to the vision of the Catholic intellectual tradition.  This is a great list that educators should think about.</p>
<p>Bieler advocates directly dealing with the question of theology, faith, morality, issues raised in the <em>Guide of the Perplexed,</em> and religious experience to which he suggests to integrate the sociology, psychology and history of religion in general and poetic literature exploring the relationship between God and man and the nature of authority. He also advises to bring in the arts and media, contemporary issues, and moral education. This is different than those who want to talk about how the Modern Orthodox greats of the past read Western books; this is an approach for integration in the future.  (Also notice how different this vision of education is than the recent turn to Neo-Chassidus, outreach, enthusiasm and emotionalism).</p>
<p><strong>5) <a href="https://rayanotyaakov.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/2008-vision-of-a-modern-orthodox-jewish-education.pdf">Vision of a Modern Orthodox Jewish Education</a> (Bieler’s voice- selections from a 34 page article)</strong></p>
<p>[M]ost Modern Orthodox institutions inherently are more likely to be figuratively “schizophrenic” and literally compartmentalized with respect to their educational vision. Asserting that equal attention must be paid to both Judaic and general studies has proven to be extremely problematic from the perspective of some if not all stake-holders in these institutions, i.e., subject matter specialists, teachers, students and the general community. To find educational theorists, instructors, students and parent bodies who embody and adhere to the educational ideal referred to as Torah uMadda (Torah and Knowledge/Science) and Torah Im Derech Eretz (Torah and the ways of the World) has not only proven difficult in the past, but has become increasingly so as religious movements in general have taken a rightward turn.</p>
<p>My favorite metaphor describing a teacher’s role in the educational process is “midwifery.” The underlying assumption driving such a metaphor is that the educational process is essentially student-centered. The teacher’s primary preoccupation is to help the student find himself, his voice, his aptitude, his passion in religious and secular disciplines and activities. To achieve such an aim, the instructor must undertake to expose his disciple to all sorts of materials and ways of thinking in order that the student can ultimately discover what “resonates” within him, what will elicit within himself a powerful response and substantive intellectual curiosity, how he might become drawn to maximize his own unique potential, talents and skill set.</p>
<p>A philosophical commitment to Modern Orthodoxy from my perspective includes the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) an awareness of an ongoing, personal involvement with God in both our individual lives as well as in all aspects of human history;</li>
<li>b) the sensibility that Judaism is part and parcel of the broadest possible understanding and conceptualization of human civilization and therefore by definition can be harmonized, at least to some degree, with many, if not most, of its widely-held perspectives and values;</li>
<li>c) the assumption that human beings while not inherently inclined to act evilly, nevertheless require explicit moral guidance and development in order for them to transcend natural human self-absorption and self-interest in order to rise to the highest levels of personal spiritual idealism and interpersonal altruism;</li>
<li>d) the belief that even an observant Jew must strive to make a significant contribution to the general quality of life of his fellow citizens, including members of non-Jewish society;</li>
<li>e) the premise that specifically because all human beings, including observant Jews, are intended to participate in a meaningful manner within the greater society, they will be exposed and attracted to innumerable activities that can potentially easily sidetrack them from devoting appropriate time to the sort of spiritual reflection and growth that would allow them to realize their spiritual potentials.</li>
<li>f) the awareness that participation within general human society will entail encountering manifold situations that are not clearly delineated within the Codes of Jewish law and other primary texts of our tradition. Therefore in order for the Modern Orthodox Jew to act consistently in accordance with Jewish values and tradition in situations that are either unprecedented or where he does not have the time to be able to direct inquiries to Halachic authorities, he will have to possess a sense of not only how to carry out individual Commandments, but also the overall philosophy, theology and worldview that underlie these Commandments, which in turn will develop within him an almost instinctual awareness as to how to act Jewishly a times when no authoritative religious guidance is available to him;</li>
<li>g) the concern that because traditional Jewish observance consists of behaviors that often entail daily multiple repetitions, in order for the individual to maintain a sense of freshness and vitality with respect to his religious practices, it is important for him to strive to constantly reflect upon these practices, seeking new insights, perspectives and intents in order that at least internally and spiritually, each repetition will ideally constitute a constantly rejuvenating and evolving approach to expressing one’s commitment to the Divine;and</li>
<li>h) the realization that in order to combat the natural human tendency to differentiate oneself from others in order to achieve distinctiveness and a personal sense of identity, traditional Jews often perceive their religious observance as setting themselves apart not only from non-Jews, but also from their less observant co-religionists. Since Modern Orthodoxy emphasizes the value of recognizing the commonality that Jews share in terms of their history, origins and values, regardless of religious orientation, it becomes necessary to constantly be on guard against socially disruptive isolationist tendencies that would create barriers between the members of the Jewish people;</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of such interdisciplinary, integrated issues might include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sociology, psychology and history of religion in general and Judaism in particular;</li>
<li>Poetic literature of various cultures exploring the relationship between God and man;</li>
<li>Theories regarding Creation, Intelligent Design and evolution;</li>
<li>The implications of the concept of infinity from religious, mathematical, philosophical and scientific perspectives;</li>
<li>The history of authority and kingship in religious and general thought. humanistic study of the highest order. Examples of such materials might include:</li>
<li>Biblical, Midrashic and Talmudic depictions of general human nature as well as individuals who either rose or fell when confronted by existential moral dilemmas;</li>
<li>Literature that foreshadowed, was produced or influenced by the Mussar Movement;</li>
<li>Classics of world literature, historical accounts and diaries, as well as contemporary media such as film, music, drama, TV programs, etc. in which situations present themselves that are morally challenging;</li>
<li>The depiction of contemporary events in the press, on the internet, in journals that center on ethical conundrums;</li>
<li>Inviting religious personalities to make presentations regarding the moral issues that they have had to deal with in their professional lives, as well as the types of problem-solving in which they had to engage in order to attempt to resolve these challenges.</li>
</ol>

				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Gershon_Rosenberg">Rabbi Shagar </a>(d. 2007), was a Torah scholar and a contemporary religious thinker left a deep mark on the educators and students of the last generation. Here is one of his major essays J<a title="rabbi-shagar-judaism-and-post-modernism" href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rabbi-shagar-judaism-and-post-modernism.docx">udaism and-Post Modernism</a>, the last essay in the work <em>Luhot ve Shivrei Luhut</em> <em>(Tablets and Broken Tablets: Jewish Thought in the Age of Post-Modernism)</em> (Yediot-Sifrei Hemed, 2013) 440- 428. The talk was given on Nisan 19, 2004 – during the intermediate days of Passover.This essay is translated for the first time into English. It is available below as a blog post and as a Word document. Print this out and read it over the next week.</p>
<p>The translation was done by Rabbi Moshe Simkovich, who was the Founding Head of School and Dean of Judaic Studies at Stern Hebrew High School in Philadelphia (now Kohelet YHS), and taught for many years at Maimonides School in Boston. He also served as a congregational Rabbi in Newton, MA.  A graduate of the University of Chicago. If anyone else has made personal translations of essays by Rav Shagar, I would be glad to post them. (Also if you find errors in this translation, please let me know).</p>

<p>Rabbi Shagar established Yeshivat Siach Yitzchak, in Efrat and was the head of the establishment until his death. Starting in the early 1980’s he was a dominant figure in the Jerusalem rabbinic world, first at Yeshivat HaKotel, then he established the yeshiva &#8220;Shefa&#8221; together with him Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz and Rabbi Menachem Froman. The yeshivah established the high school yeshiva Makor Haim. He was then head of the Beit Midrash of Beit Morasha.</p>
<p>In my past blog posts, we have discussed his <a href="../../../../2011/09/02/rav-shagar-btorato-yehageh-the-study-of-talmud-as-a-quest-for-god-part-i/index.html">approach to Torah study, </a> <a href="../../../../2015/01/18/rav-shagar-to-be-connected-to-eyn-living-in-a-postmodern-world/index.html">his post modernism, </a><a href="../../../../2012/07/05/rav-shagar-movie-tribute-to-his-life-and-thought/index.html">watched a TV documentary about his lif</a>e and <a href="../../../../2013/08/21/datlash-hardal-according-to-rav-shagar/index.html">his views of a return to traditionalism away from method and ideology</a>. We also looked at how <a href="../../../../2016/09/17/smadar-cherlow-who-moved-my-judaism-judaism-post-modernism-and-contemporary-spirituality/index.html">Smadar Cherlow portrayed the post- Rabbi Shagar turn.</a></p>
<p>Here we return to his post-modernism by looking at his own words, an eight -page essay where he explained what he means by postmodernism.</p>
<p>Before I start, I must note that Rav Shagar described himself for several decades as a Hasidic existentialist approach. And in the recent work by his colleague <a href="http://www.ybook.co.il/book/5732/%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91">Rabbi Yair Dreifus, <em>Touching the Heart</em> [Hebrew]</a> (2013) about Shagar’s approach, he also portrays him as a Hasidic existentialist.</p>
<p>Yet, Rav Shagar did read David Gurevitz, <em>Post-Modernism: Culture and Literature at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century</em> (Dvir, 1997), a general work applying post-modernism to Israeli literature such as Etgar Keret and the Hebrew translation of Lyotard’s <em>The Postmodern Condition</em> (Hebrew translation, 1999) and adapted the language as his own to describe the prior twenty years of his thinking.</p>
<blockquote><p>How does it feel, how does it feel?<br />
To be on your own, with no direction home (Bob Dylan)</p>
<p>And if you want to be free, be free<br />
Cause there&#8217;s a million things to be<br />
You know that there are  (Cat Stevens/Yusef Islam)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the essay below, Rav Shagar celebrates the virtues of autonomy, individualism, choosing one’s own life path and to seek one’s own answers. He sees this as inevitable in that we live in an age where there is a breakdown of the hierarchical and patriarchal society and we encourage kids to be themselves. He encourage the individualism we know from most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from John Dewey&#8217;s educational works to the TVshow by Marlo Thomas, <em>Free to be You and Me (1972).</em> We now have the freedom the create our own reality, to decide whom we marry and accept to responsibility for our life choices.</p>
<p>This is not post-modernism in which we are socially constructed, or bound by language and epistemic ruptures, or disseminating based on language, or “a religion without religion,” or a religion noted by its absence, or making it immanent in the shopping mall and media. Shagar is good old-fashioned existentialist, pragmatist, and romantic with an emphasis on autonomy.</p>
<p>Yet, he is post-modern in a limited sense of having no grand narrative, no foundations, and no metaphysics.  He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am of the opinion that postmodernism and deconstructionism constitute a ‘shattering of the vessels’ (<strong>שבירת הכלים</strong>).  Yet this very shattering grants us wide ranging freedom, and as far as religion goes &#8211; freedom to believe, even without absolute proofs and evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>For him, &#8220;belief is found in life not ideology.&#8221; Shagar writes: “the transition from a ‘Religion of Truth’ to a ‘Religion of Belief’ is the most profound point of Post-Modernism.” For Shagar, “the departure from Egypt not just as an historic event, but rather as a paradigm for every generation; a leaving of restraints behind, a breaking of the world’s boundaries and oppression.</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; wrong with lovin&#8217; who you are<br />
She said, &#8217;cause He made you perfect, babe<br />
… I&#8217;m beautiful in my way<br />
&#8216;Cause God makes no mistakes<br />
I&#8217;m on the right track, baby<br />
I was born this way  (Lady Gaga)</p></blockquote>
<p>How do we do <em>teshuvah</em> (repentance)? Rabbi Soloveitchik viewed repentance as an existential act of self-creation. For Rabbi Shagar, the first question we need to ask is: to where can we return? There is no direction to return. For us, repentance is the radical acceptance of the self.</p>
<p>We were born this way, and we should accept God’s creation of individual difference.  Shagar lets you accept yourself and your personal turns and struggles and individuality.  Post-moderns deconstruct the self, Rav Shagar like Lady Gaga advocates a total acceptance of the self.  We need to embrace our Freedom, personal choice, and existential choices.</p>
<p>Shagar’s vision is to see this as a constructive moment for exciting new faith options. Just as Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook challenged the status quo with new ideas and new ways of seeing things, we should embrace this opportunity. Tolerance for others and those who challenge us is a good thing for creative encounter.</p>
<p>For most modernists, including The Rebbe, Rav Soloveitchik and Kierkegaard – one comes down from the peak moment of the religious experience and then channel the experience into an acceptance of the yoke of heaven and the ordinary life.</p>
<p>For Rabbi Shagar, however, the peak moment is “authenticity, as readiness to be myself.” One then comes down and accepts “the yoke of Heaven” butit is through the “wholehearted acceptance of this independence as a divine fiat, not as chance.” One understands that “there is no instant of authenticity, and so it is a more difficult freedom.</p>
<p>He advocates a mystical option as a solution of our era. He quotes Rabv Kook and Gershom Scholem that “mysticism is the seed of religion.”  In mysticism, there “is real potential for a religiosity of intimacy, of a strong passionate position in regards to the Infinite, the very position searched for by Rav Kook… This is my religiosity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We were born sick”, you heard them say it<br />
My church offers no absolutes (Take Me to Church by Hozier)</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in this essay, Rabbi Shagar has a strong critique of system. He points to the excesses of Religious Zionism, and to young adults  who give up their religiosity upon discovering that the truths of the yeshiva do not stand up to the university and secular culture.</p>
<p>The fundamentalism of the Religious Zionist position with its fixed answers leads to a breakdown into those who chose the Haredi side by becoming Hardal (haredi leumi) and those who become part of the Conservative movement. Religious Zionism has become downtrodden by its own ideological stances.</p>
<p>Those who went into the Hesder yeshivot overburdened their life’s with ideology- which is a fixed statue and hardened structure. In addition, looking over one’s shoulder at the observance of others is a sign of estrangement and shows an inability to relate to one’s essence.</p>
<p>In the tradition of liberal pluralism of the West, Rabbi Shagar is against religious coercion.</p>
<blockquote><p>My pluralism does not remain within the walls of the study hall; it is wider.  Yet I hold to it without thereby saying all is acceptable; I am not passive, holding back from opposing things that are off-limits.  At the same time, and I say this deliberately, I have no need to disqualify things that are not within my circle.  I can be true to my faith, live, die, and kill by its authority, and in so doing I do not have a need to create a hierarchy of beliefs crowning mine above all; who is better or worse is a question without substance.</p></blockquote>
<p>One should not insult or even be patronizing toward non-Orthodox, they are not “captive children” but thinking and informed adults. He distinguishes between his public beliefs and his private personal views, therefore we have to understand the role of Reform conversions and marriages, as well as civil marriage.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve conquered my past<br />
The future is here at last<br />
I stand at the entrance to a new world I can see.<br />
The ruins to the right of me<br />
Will soon have lost sight of me. (U2 &#8211;Love, Rescue Me)</p></blockquote>
<p>This essay ends on a high note looking toward the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am enthusiastic.  I see something deep and great transpiring now.  Amongst the young I see personalities that did not exist when I was young, young men and women with great spiritual devotion, deep religiosity, not empty-headed nor caught in fantasy &#8211; rather, individuals who are quite sober, mature, reflective.  They have a form of charisma and religious devotion, very real, that didn’t exist when I was their age.  Neither I nor others amongst my generation had it.  I foresee in the footsteps of Postmodernism and in the ‘New Age Culture’ that comes on its heels, an entry point to a new world, one in which there will occur a real change in human consciousness.  This change will also bring societal changes, greater social justice, and much deeper interpersonal relationships.  A world where the divine presence will be tangible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi Shagar, regardless of the philosophic label, allows a generation to accept the complexities of the modern world without looking for a resolution. His thought made space for questioning and the liberating acceptance of the possibility of alternatives. They are not going back to the ideological certainties of the past, but look to create new approaches.</p>

<p><strong>JUDAISM AND POSTMODERNISM &#8211; CONCLUDING THOUGHTS (<a title="rabbi-shagar-judaism-and-post-modernism" href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rabbi-shagar-judaism-and-post-modernism.docx">Word file</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I am concerned that my involvement with Postmodernism may have been unduly delayed, that is, too late to fully realize the opportunity for a real revitalization of our religious world.  Passover, the Jewish Festival of Freedom, teaches us not to force matters, but we also must not push matters off.  From my perspective, one of the problems of the Torah world is that out of concern for forcing matters, all too often we act too late, and the ramifications are tragic.</p>
<p>I do not intend to sanctify Postmodernism, and I do not wish to hide from its problems.  However, the Postmodernism position is not at all marginal; it exerts its influence throughout society.  We must come to terms with it.  One can observe the influence of Postmodernism even in the relationship of children to their parents and teachers &#8211; a small child might contact the police if his father beats him, and if his teacher tells him something he will not hesitate to tell him how he thinks differently.  The relativistic mindset is already embedded in the basic personality structures of children.</p>
<p>The influence of Postmodernism is also recognizable in the religious community. It is particularly so in the younger generation, as is readily apparent from the perspective of its popular repercussions.  One could argue that the loss of authority, nihilism, and the instability was due to the ideological excesses that characterize Religious Zionism.</p>
<p>True, seminaries and yeshivot hesder thrive and increase, but are most young adults there?  How many of the young complete army service, skip through the universities, and remain true to Religious Zionism?  What of the phenomena of secularity that apparently is here to stay?  And in general, what of the ‘good youth’ who complete yeshiva and enter university?  More than once I have heard of students, even those who studied in more ‘open’ yeshivot, who complain: ‘They misled me in yeshiva!’  When they came to university they encountered a different worldview, a secular culture that they testify forced them to totally reconsider the worldview as taught in the yeshiva.</p>
<p>Indeed, there were those who foresaw that the confrontation between Torah and Western Culture would tear the religious community up, splitting it into a Conservative camp, and a Haredi or Haredi-Zionist camps (חרד&#8221;ל); one could claim we see that very thing before us now.  From my point of view, the problem has not one but two sides, i.e. as evidenced by the Haredi-Zionist phenomena.  In some of the yeshivot, there is missed opportunity &#8211; a slide of the Religious Zionist perspective towards inflexible fundamentalism.  This is at variance from the blend that we aspire to; to be rooted in the land in its deepest and simplest manifestation, while at the same time to be rooted in universalistic-modern values.  These Neo-Haredi do not return to the prevailing Haredi stance, which has its own natural flow and whose essence is self-evident to its followers.  It is precisely because these Haredim are of the modern rather than the traditionalist world, and yet are taken aback by the ramifications of their ideology, that their strict reverence creates a new sort of Haredi. I must tell you this form of Haredi scares me.  It seems dangerous because of the identity it creates, not to mention its impact upon the communal and political levels.  I identify this breaking up of Religious Zionism with the impact of Postmodernism. In response to the multi-faceted Postmodernist challenge, some give in to modern culture, and some throw up defenses against it.</p>
<p>In the face of this reality, what I wanted to do is, as Rav Kook said, ‘build a palace of faith beyond apostasy (כפירה)’, i.e. to recognize this situation and not to settle for its mere internalization as is, or its rejection.  I would rather see how it can help build a new level of faith based on our reality, whatever the difficulty.  I will not hide my conviction that in this situation there are exciting faith options, ones that I believe are superior to classical or modern options.</p>
<p>Moreover, and here I make an audacious leap, I see myself like someone grasping the hems of Rav Kook’s cloak in his coming to terms with the era’s movements.  I don’t mean to compare myself to Rav Kook, I am dust under his feet.  But if you wish to follow his path you must learn from his example, have the bravery to clarify and come to terms with modern culture and the times, as well as stand up to the critics of your approach.</p>
<p>Truly, one should not forget that the Rav’s ideas also raised serious challenges.  More than once critics claimed that his way was appropriate for those on his high level, but not for people at large.  For example, the Gerrer Rebbe, the ‘Imrei Emes’, after critiquing Rav Kook, spoke about him in glowing terms, but held that his way was not suited for the general public.  Rav Haim Sonnenfeld criticized Rav Kook’s tolerance and opposed his ‘impatience for the end’ (messianic hopes).</p>
<p>Still and all, these were classic attacks, resisting all who had breakthroughs.  Whenever we have to consider change, we are filled with doubts and fears.  The new portends destruction of the old, and forces us to separate from old good familiar ways.  But if we wish to contend with the questions raised by changing times &#8211; modern in Rav Kook’s times, postmodern in ours &#8211; we have no alternative.  Even if we don’t want to confront the times, we are forced to do so.  Thus, as Rav Nachman [of Breslov] says, we must adopt a position based on the power of holiness and must say things heretofore deemed unacceptable, even though it contradicts earlier approaches.</p>
<p>Postmodernism does not have a standard definition, and many have written about this.  Many Postmodernists themselves resist a clear definition of their perspective, as in principle they oppose definitions.  For the sake of our discussions Postmodernism can be characterized as a position that holds truth to be a function of societal cultural constructs, and thus denies that certitude is possible, Post-modernism can also be characterized as a radical striving for freedom, i.e. the freedom of the individual to establish himself and his values.</p>
<p>There are educators, perhaps the majority, who denigrate Postmodernism as absolutely worthless, seeing in it dissolution, nihilism, and the breakdown of societal framework.  Others can accept limited aspects &#8211; as a critique that awakens us to the falsity and limitations under which we exist, or as it expands the pluralistic horizons of our education- not as negative phenomena, but as an in-house inner critique. Yet, I believe there is a more radical critique here.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that postmodernism and deconstructionism constitute a ‘shattering of the vessels’ (שבירת הכלים).  Yet this very shattering grants us wide ranging freedom, and as far as religion goes &#8211; freedom to believe, even without absolute proofs and evidence.</p>
<p>The Hassidim understood the departure from Egypt not just as an historic event, but rather as a paradigm for every generation; a leaving of restraints behind, a breaking of the world’s boundaries and oppression.  In this sense postmodernism is a departure from these limitations in its most radical sense.</p>
<p>In relationship to this conception I would like to emphasize a few points.</p>
<p>My friend Rabbi Yehuda Brandes opposes the classical and widespread trend to base Jewish Philosophy curricula on the assumption that faith can be rationally demonstrated.  His opposition is based on the premise that a young student who is not philosophically adept, in the framework of the spiritual cultural world in which he exists, will not incorporate these proofs.</p>
<p>In its place he recommends a Hassidic Existentialist position &#8211; to attempt to show the student a point which he too can believe in &#8211; assuming no one to be a total nihilist.  It is our job to clarify, or to help the student clarify, that point of absolute truth which he too believes.  Once this entry point to belief has been brought to light, one can move on, perhaps expand his domain of belief, and make a place there for additional beliefs.</p>
<p>The reader should be careful not to misunderstand this exposition as a call to no longer attempt philosophical proofs that support faith; the mood of our times must come to terms with any suggested change along these lines. Just as a philosophical or historical proof will hold little interest for our youth, similarly an existential proof will likely not be accepted.  Why?  Because faith, by definition, cannot be conclusively proven.  The very pursuit of a sturdy viewpoint, with reliable support for faith, undermines it.</p>
<p>I attempted to demonstrate this very point in my book “Kelim Nishbarim” (Broken Vessels).  We must free ourselves from seeing discussions of faith as providing reliable support, something to hang on to.  Faith is its own category &#8211; I can pray to God, I can be part of the faith, I can identify myself as a believer &#8211; but once someone brings ‘proof’ for faith, I am no longer a ‘believer’.  Proof and faith are mutually exclusive.  Bringing a proof to me does not make me a believer.  A proof of that sort is like a gun pointed at my head, and it cannot influence my inner being.</p>
<p>Here is where I see the constructive role of Postmodernism.  Postmodernism typically leads down the road to nihilism, relativism, to a loss of a point of reference, to no longer being able to validate faith; yet it can lead us to discussions of faith (rather than just about faith), and free us to pray.</p>
<p>This postmodernist world, in my humble opinion, opens the door to a much higher level of belief.  What drives my thoughts of God is not the idea of God’s great omnipotence, but rather that God is not ‘a thing’; God is the absolute pure, the fulfilled seeking, the infinite; as Maimonides says ‘the Omnipresent but not of the world’.  The ‘devekut’ (cleaving or intense spirituality) that this recognition generates flows from our understanding that divinity and belief are not truly accessible to language and objects  This understanding releases us from our daily preoccupations, allows us to enter into the world of belief and prayer, and thus brings us to devekut (cleaving to God), deeper faith, and great dedication.  Thus, I contend that we should release faith and religiosity from the objective-philosophical domain of facts, as faith is not something that one can really verbally express.  In this manner Postmodernism can create faith based on freedom, faith that is based on personal choice, on a decision.  Such a freedom is of course terrible and difficult, with a feeling of the earth quaking beneath us.  Thus, Sartre spoke about how the individual is condemned to freedom, but we must overcome this ominous predicament, and train ourselves to a radical freedom that entails deciding to accept the heavenly yoke.</p>
<p>This point is particularly important for adherents of the Religious-Zionist movement, so downtrodden by ideological stances. One could characterize the previous generation as the generation of Baalei-Teshuva (returnees to faith).  In that generation religion was not a given, deeply rooted, as in the Haredi world.  The gap between faith and the Baal-Teshuva was bridged through ideology, which responded to contradictions between traditional Judaism and the values and lifestyle of modern life.  However, ideology and faith are not identical; ideology is like a statue, a picture, a hardened structure, and doesn’t have the sense of the infinite that characterizes faith in the divine.  The Midrash says that God is truth, because God lives.  Belief is found in life, not in ideology or philosophy.</p>
<p>Postmodernism’s sharp opposition to ideologies dispels the Religious-Zionist community’s extreme emphasis on ideology, bringing it back to a Living Torah.  From this perspective one can learn from Haredi, which at its best is built from identity and not ideology, which changes the Jewish world into something self-evident.  We need an education that fosters accepting Heaven’s yoke in its highest conceptualization, reforming our existing religious world into a world that confidently affirms itself without constantly looking over its shoulder.  Ideology often is a sign of estrangement, of an inability to relate to one’s essence and all its ramifications. Thus a sensitive and open pedagogy (that yet maintains certain connections) characteristic of the Haredi world, should be an important central ingredient in our education.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the transition from a ‘Religion of Truth’ to a ‘Religion of Belief’ is the most profound point of Post-Modernism.</p>
<p>From a pedagogical standpoint, instead of speaking about ‘the Truth’, which in the Postmodernist conception has a pejorative connotation, let us speak of ‘accepting the yoke of Heaven’.  This is something altogether different.  Our truest difficulty is to accept the yoke of Heaven; to accept responsibility.  An example from married life:  A man could fall in love with a particular woman, but in order to get married he must do something further &#8211; he must (mindfully) decide to get married.  A person can be married many years without coming to the conclusion that this is the woman with whom he wishes to spend his entire life.   It is the same in the domain of faith, and in the domain of values.  In all these domains there are needs to make a decisive move to accept the yoke of Heaven.  This decision is a paradoxical move. It is not based on arguments and proofs, but rather on the readiness of the person to become obligated, and to trust in the values that due to his decision become obligatory and absolute.</p>
<p>Here a beautiful Chabad teaching is worth consideration.  Chabad distinguishes between Passover where the departure from Egypt is at its heart, and the Counting of the Omer.  The departure from Egypt is inspirational, redemptive, and filled with love, as expressed in the Song of Songs which we read on Passover.  But as usually happens, when we descend back into our mundane routine world, enthusiasm dissipates.  An individual cannot base his life on passion, redemption, and inspiration, of the theme of departing Egypt, which Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi indeed recommended to be the anchor for faith.  Thus, we need the ritual of Counting the Omer in which we accept the yoke of Heaven &#8211; readiness to serve without such illuminations.</p>
<p>One can explain these two stages; illumination and accepting Heaven’s yoke, in a different way.</p>
<p>The emancipation of leaving Egypt is freedom as independence, authenticity, as readiness to be myself; it is the primary freedom.  The second freedom, accepting the yoke of Heaven, is the wholehearted acceptance of this independence as a divine fiat, not as chance.  In contrast to the first decision, there is no instant of authenticity, and so it is a more difficult freedom.</p>
<p>Indeed, from the pedagogical angle it is difficult to create a sensitivity to independence,  to the divine point within us.  To some of our youth this independence is nothing but chance and relativism.  They will claim that they are faithful, but only because they were brought up that way. If they were brought up somewhere else they would have grown into different people, perhaps not faithful.  Of course such an attitude weakens the possibility to hand down tradition, to enter into the Torah world empowered and with conviction.  This difficulty of having a self-confident identity is an effect of the inability to have confidence in any foundational point outside of oneself.</p>
<p>Besides the claim that Postmodernism can purify and free us to believe, in <em>Broken Vessels </em>I argued that all told, a decision to believe is based on the person himself.  Belief in truly begins with us.  Accepting the yoke of Heaven begins from the point of the absolute incomprehensible void, and this is difficult since this commitment in itself is prone to be understood as nihilistic.  Indeed, it has been said that both the apikorus (non-believer) and faithful refer to the ‘void’, but the believer refers to the ‘holy void’.  The ‘unholy void’ of Postmodernism can flip and become the ‘holy void’ which the Kabbalists speak of, and from which they derived their closeness to the divine. The task I set for myself in my book was a description of this phenomena.  I think that in this manner, the problem itself is potentially the source of its solution.</p>
<p>Emphatically, I do not take lightly the possibility that Postmodernism can lead to nihilism.  It not only disparages the idea of truth and the ability to prove, but also challenges the whole concept of religious norms, values, and ethics, seeing in them societal repression.  It identifies those things which we perceive as givens in our reality as social constructs.  Yet, in so doing it enables radical freedom, and it is this very freedom that scares religious people.  To me, the answer to this fear is the understanding that a construct may be specifically empowered, such as what came into being via the six days of creation, or that descended from Sinai. It all depends upon the ability to accept the yoke, to decide.  We must not fear freedom.  I am not party to the fear that in a world of unlimited possibilities, a world where belief itself is possible, where a decision &#8211; and not logical proof nor society &#8211; determines belief, that we will abandon religion. I am not party to the fear that without a campaign built on constraints, pressures, and compulsion, our youth will run away.  I myself am not tied into a social network for security &#8211; normative or otherwise &#8211; in order to fulfill mitzvoth.  We need to believe in ourselves and to believe in the Only One.</p>
<p>I was not surprised by the reactions to my book, neither by the opposition to it, nor its popularity, nor by the intensity of the responses.  I am not interested in the consensus, and there is no doubt that the critiques and stands expressed in the book are likely to shake many convictions.  This was indeed my goal; shaking Religious-Zionist thinking from its dogmatism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was very frustrated because the essential message of the book was missed and misunderstood.  This is the mystical option that Postmodernism enables, precisely because of the deconstruction that comes in its wake and its strong critique of the rationalist position.  As Rav Kook taught in a multitude of places, mysticism is the seed of religion.  Scholars such as Gershom Scholem held the same from their perspectives.  Here is real potential for a religiosity of intimacy, of a strong passionate position in regards to the Infinite, the very position searched for by Rav Kook and his students the Nazir and Rav Charlap.  This is my religiosity.</p>
<p><em>From here we move on to an additional basic point, with emphasis on the social context.</em></p>
<p>Does Postmodernism lead to a passive ethical relativism?  I think not.  Here too fine distinctions must be made between tolerance and pluralism (I do not think of these words as pejoratives) of the right sort &#8211; a sort of openness; and of an improper sort &#8211; one might call it dissoluteness.  Dissoluteness connotes a direction that holds nothing true,  I can accept anything.  In contrast, openness can be a higher perspective &#8211; absolute commitment to my truth, but with the capacity to recognize other’s truths.  I need not think my house is the best; it is enough to know it is my house.  The important question, once again, is the question of acceptance of the yoke of Heaven, the question of the integrity of my beliefs, the question of whether I believe absolutely.</p>
<p>Thus, I hold a complex position in regards to distinguishing pluralism from relativism. Even though under certain circumstances I can understand the perspective of one person coming to kill another, I will do what I can to prevent him from sacrificing someone, and if I have no choice I will bring about his death.  That is what God wants of me.  If someone comes and asks me &#8211; ‘Why don’t you figure out what God wants from <em>us</em>?’ &#8211; I would answer that it is not my problem.  I am not to be held accountable for this question!  The question I do ask myself is not about what is universally true, but rather a more intimate question &#8211; ‘What does God want from <em>you</em>?’  This question is in the forefront of my awareness in the here and now, and with this there can also be a strong and deep stand based on my values and faith, one that in extreme situations can go the limit, even risking self-sacrifice, or sacrificing another.</p>
<p>I will provide an example that expresses this pluralistic position in regards to the relationship of religion and state.  I am not in favor of Reform conversion nor civil marriage.  However, when we wish to lead a state, there is a great difference between a personal position and a public stance; and the question of whether to impose one’s faith upon others is inevitable.  I do not have to denigrate all other positions in order to promulgate my own.  My pluralism allows me sensitivity to diverse cultures.  I believe the Messiah will come and that everyone one will return, but from my point of view this conviction is not relevant to the state’s laws.  In the same way, I cannot establish the relationship to secular Jews on the basis of the paternalistic principle of ‘tinok shenishba’ (“a captive child” without Jewish connection is given the benefit of the doubt in regards to culpability) &#8211; the secular person would not accept such a characterization, and truth be told I do not see him as a ‘tinok shenishba’ in the classical understanding of the term.  On the contrary, it seems to me that if we want to retain some measure of religious character in the state, some minimal unifying national force, and no less important &#8211; the opening up of the religious community, we must begin with a pluralistic perspective.  This approach should be considered in regards to the proposals about the issues above as of late, such as the proposal for couples in regards to civil marriage.</p>
<p>Is it legitimate to bring such complex positions before the public?  When we first established <em>Yeshivat Mekor Haim</em>, there were those who said that students should first undergo the regular course of yeshiva studies, and only then should be taught the more complex approaches we were bringing.  They claimed: ‘If you present them to a young student, without yeshiva preparation, you will destroy him.’  No doubt, there is some truth to this claim.  Certainly a student must be taught in a conducive relatable manner, and it is a challenge to teach a student to grasp matters this way.  Pedagogy according to the belief system of the Rishonim, who grasped such matters via metaphysics, gives an initial degree of protection, creates a house.  Only after that is taught does it make sense to introduce the approach I am suggesting.  Parenthetically, I would like to say that I by no means endorse the Postmodernist claim that one should forego the house, forego being at home.  On the contrary!  I would like to see how one could build a house in a landless world, how one could come to being at home in a world of (unstructured) freedom.</p>
<p>Withal, I do not think we should hold off the Postmodernist critique for only the mature; beyond any doubt a good pedagogy for youth will enable the building of a home base for him/her along with an independent identity.  This indeed is our pedagogical goal; but its basis must be, once again, a basis built on life and not on ideology.  Seder night is a model for this; the experiences of seder night are in-depth experiences that create a youth’s identity; augmented by its smells and flavors, by the aura that passes amongst everyone.  It is there that the deep foundational structure of religious identity exists.  If one does not have that, it is very difficult to build deep and flowing belief.</p>
<p>How you educate a young person determines his/her possibilities later. If you teach him/her like the Griz (הגרי&#8221;ז סולובייציק), who stood with his son at the window and pointed at the people who stood in line at the Edison Theater saying: “They are asses, camels&#8230;” you cannot impose on such an outlook another outlook that is more pluralistic.  Therefore it is all important to continue the discussion of the best education for the young.  One might begin with a relatively conservative education, even Haredi in some aspects along the lines which we have discussed, but one must carefully cultivate openness, and build a structure of faith on the basis of identity, of life, of a natural flow, and not on the basis of self-estrangement and ideology.  One must start training early towards religious responsibility, towards acceptance of the yoke of Heaven by choice and self-recognition, and not rely on compulsion and authority.</p>
<p>I have not given up.  On the contrary, I am enthusiastic.  I see something deep and great transpiring now.  Amongst the young I see personalities that did not exist when I was young, young men and women with great spiritual devotion, deep religiosity, not empty-headed nor caught in fantasy &#8211; rather, individuals who are quite sober, mature, reflective.  They have a form of charisma and religious devotion, very real, that didn’t exist when I was their age.  Neither I nor others amongst my generation had it.  I foresee in the footsteps of Postmodernism and in the ‘New Age Culture’ that comes on its heels, an entry point to a new world, one in which there will occur a real change in human consciousness.  This change will also bring societal changes, greater social justice, and much deeper interpersonal relationships.  A world where the divine presence will be tangible.</p>

				<p>The <em>Zohar</em> is a collection of over 32 different works with slightly different theologies and literary styles. Volume 11 of the new Pritzker editions is a collection of smaller works, including later pieces of <em>Midrash ha-Neelam</em>, and the <em>Matnitin.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zohar-Pritzker-Eleven-Joel-Hecker/dp/0804784507">The new volume, Volume 11 was translated,</a> edited and annotated by Joel Hecker, Professor of Jewish Mysticism at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, who was ordained by RIETS and a PhD from NYU.  Professor Hecker said that his approach to annotation is toward greater annotation, an arc already started in the latter volumes by Daniel C. Matt. Hecker also offers greater discussion of halakhic issues in his annotations.</p>
<p>Hecker’s approach to translation was to follow Matt’s lead, but to my ear he placed more emphasis on the poetics of retaining alliteration, use of synonyms, and the general sound and feel of the texts. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zohar-Pritzker-Eleven-Joel-Hecker/dp/0804784507">The volume is a hefty 800 pages</a>, so I have not yet worked though the translation- -it only arrived yesterday—however, even from the sample of passages that I looked at, they were marvelous in their capturing the original.</p>

<blockquote><p>Come and See: There is an Aramaic Zohar above and a Pritzker English Zohar below.  The Zohar above and the Zohar below are perfectly balanced. When the Zohar descends into American Jewish culture, it needs to put on the garment of this world. If the Zohar did not put on a garment befitting this culture, the work could not endure in this world and the world could not endure them. Happy are they who look at Zohar properly! As wine must sit in a jar, so Zohar must sit in this garment. Hecker’s translation and annotation allows one to reference back to original text, allowing one to remember that these words are garments for the original printed Zohar.</p></blockquote>
<p>My interview with the translator of the first nine volumes- <a href="../../../../2016/03/17/interview-with-daniel-c-matt-translator-of-the-pritzker-edition-of-the-zohar/index.html">Daniel C. Matt is here.</a> For my review of <a href="../../../../2010/01/13/why-read-the-zohar/index.html">one of the volumes and Melila Heller-Eshed&#8217;s work, see here.</a> For a general interview with<a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20161002_New_translation_of_Jewish_mystical_text_for_a_new_audience.html"> Joel Hecker in the  Philadelphia Inquirer  see here.</a> </p>
<p>A little historical background will help in reading this volume. This volume contains several sections of the <em>Zohar</em> called <em>Midrash ha-Neelam, which </em>are separate in language and theology than the main body of the <em>Zohar</em>. They have a Hebrew core and an Aramaic overlay, they mainly concern the soul and other allegorical topics, rather than sefirot, and the named scholars are unlike the Zohar. The works use Neoplatonic philosophic language and philosophic terminology. The <em>Midrash ha-Neelam</em> offer a sense of how 13<sup>th</sup> century Castilian Jews integrated the <em>Heikhalot</em> and early esotericism with the scholastic philosophic traditions.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, Rabbi Yaakov Emden considered these sections separate and earlier than the rest of the corpus. In 1926, Gershom Scholem speculated in his inaugural lecture at Hebrew University, that these texts were earlier than the rest of the <em>Zohar.</em> Scholem completely buried this article and never referred to it; he considered these sections from Moses deLeon. Samuel Belkin, (1957) argued that there were Philonic elements in the work, which received a long critique from R.J. Z. Werblowsky (1960).</p>
<p>Current range for the origin of the Midrash ha-Neelam is between 1250 as an allegorical precursor to the Zohar to 1280 as part of De Leon’s large oeuvre, the opposite positions of belong to Ronit Meroz and  Nathan Wolski.</p>
<p>Ah… but all this is only background. <em>Pritzker Zohar Volume 11</em> contains a selection of later texts that are modeled on <em>Midrash ha-Neelam</em>. They are post-Zohar and before the 14th century <em>Tikkune Zohar</em>, and combine philosophic allegory with kabbalistic sefirot. They also have significant amounts of reworked later Midrash such as <em>Eichah Rabbah</em> or the short works of <em>Batei Midrashot.</em></p>
<p>What is the origin of these later texts?  1250 and then additions in 1280? All 1280? How many strata? Was there an Aramaic overlay on Hebrew original or mixed language right from the start. Were they written by several people? Who were they? What did they think they were doing? Did they relate to one another?</p>
<p>Current Hebrew University thinking is to speak of an “intermediate layer” or a &#8220;middle layer&#8221; of the Zohar corpus written between the <em>Zohar</em> and the <em>Tikkunim.</em> They can currently fudge the issue by placing many short works that have no clear category into this basket.</p>
<p>An example of one of these works included in the volume is <em>Midrash haNeelam </em>on the book of Ruth. It was originally published as a separate volume independently of the<em> Zohar</em> and then was added later to the printed edition of the <em>Zohar Hadash</em>, which was extra material not included in the first printing.  Elimelekh, Naomi, Ruth, &amp; Orpah, are mapped onto four different aspects of soul (as often happens in <em>Midrash ha-Ne&#8217;lam al ha-Torah</em>). However, here those identifications were simultaneously mapped onto the tetragrammaton, with explicit reference to Father, Mother, Son, Daughter.</p>
<blockquote><p> “Corresponding to this: Naomi—נשמה (<em>neshamah</em>), holy soul. Elimelech—נשמתא לנשמתא (<em>nishmeta le-nishmeta</em>), soul of soul. Mahlon—רוח השכלית (<em>rua<u>h</u> ha-sikhlit</em>), intellectual spirit. Ruth—נפש השכלית (<em>nefesh ha-sikhlit</em>), intellectual soul. Chilion—רוח הבהמיות (<em>rua<u>h</u> ha-behemi’ut</em>), animal spirit.</p>
<p>“Of this Solomon said <em>Who knows if </em>רוח (<em>rua<u>h</u></em>),<em> the spirit</em>,<em> of man ascends on high and </em>רוח (<em>rua<u>h</u></em>),<em> the spirit</em>,<em> of a beast descends into earth?</em> (Ecclesiastes 3:21). <em>Rua<u>h</u></em> <em>of man</em>—Mahlon. <em>Bestial rua<u>h</u></em>—Chilion, from the left side. <em>Bestial</em> <em>nefesh</em>—Orpah, stiff-necked, from the left side. Thus Chilion—his name was not remembered in Israel.”<em> (Zohar <u>H</u>adash</em> 78b).</p></blockquote>
<p>Others works in this volume are the <em>Matnitin</em> and the <em>Tosefta</em> which present themselves as an earlier strata corresponding to the Talmudic Mishnah. In these works, we have a reworking of an ethos of the Heikhalot into a dramatic heightened style, almost poetic, awakening the reader to the visionary and hidden. I have always been quite fond of these sections and have always thought they would make a good volume of visionary poetry.  They echo <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> and other early works. Rabbi Moses Cordovero considered these works as primary keys to opening up the rest of the <em>Zohar</em> and that they may be the earliest part of the <em>Idrot</em> texts.</p>
<p>Try reading this passage aloud:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matnitin. “Will of the deed, clusters of faith! A voice—voice of voices—arousing above and below. Open-eyed we were. Sphere above, rotating toward diverse sides. A voice intones, arousing, “Awaken sleepy, slumbering ones, with sleep in their sockets, who do not know to look and do not see! Stopped-up ears, lethargic hearts, they sleep and do not know. The Torah stands before them, yet they pay no heed, and do not know upon what they gaze; who look but do not see. The Torah sends forth voices, ‘Look, foolish ones! Open your eyes and understand!’ Yet none pays heed, and none inclines his ear! How long shall you remain in the darkness of your desires? Look and understand, and the shining light will be revealed to you!&#8221; Zohar 1:161b (Vol. 11, pp. 542-43)</p></blockquote>
<p>If you read it aloud then you saw the contribution of Hecker’s concern with poetics and the sound of the text. Here is a section of Tosefta to read aloud:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were close by, heard a voice concatenating above, downward, spreading throughout the world. A voice smashing mountains, shattering mighty rocks, gargantuan whirlwinds ascending, our ears patulous. Proclaiming in undulations: “Thorn-prick to slumberers, torpor in their sockets, subsisting in their subsistence.</p>
<p>The King speaks! Avoid inebriation, gatekeepers! The ruler of numerous troops is stationed in his place! All are insensate, unaware that the book is open, names recorded. <em>Zohar</em> 1:121a (Vol. 11, pp. 608-9).</p></blockquote>
<p>This project will be finished with a final volume in a few months. The <em>Pritzker Zohar</em> will be known in future decades as one of the great Judaica projects of our era, whose immense contribution with be evident in the upcoming years as rabbis start to teach and integrate these texts.</p>
<p>Several decades ago, Prof. Rivka Shatz-Uffenheimer of Hebrew University envisioned a <em>Zohar</em> project of dividing the corpus between many scholars to analyze its content. Maybe the completion of these volumes would be good time to renew the project in the United States and divide the 12 volumes among 40-50 scholars who would elucidate its meanings and treasures. However this time, since the volumes are in English, maybe invite poets, theologians, cultural theorists, and comparative students of mysticism, along with midrash, and Jewish thought scholars to open up the text.</p>
<p><strong>1) What is Midrash ha-Ne’lam? </strong></p>
<p><em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> is from the earliest stratum of Zoharic writing, first appearing in the early 1280’s.  <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> is written in a mix of Hebrew and Aramaic, and those two different languages reflect greater interests in allegory and kabbalistic symbolism, respectively.  The allegorical readings here are often spiritualized readings of biblical characters as stand-ins for different parts of the human soul and psyche.</p>
<p>Shifra Asulin has argued that the kabbalistically-inflected Aramaic material was written and woven in to an older allegorical Hebrew text of <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em>.</p>
<p>Scribes and printers sometimes attached the title <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> to other texts. Rabbi Yaakov Emden, the first person to engage in extensive critical analysis of the <em>Zohar</em>, tried to delineate its parameters using careful methodological criteria; he refers to one Zoharic section as “not from the true <em>Zohar</em>, but rather typical of formulations from the <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em>” (<em>Mitpa<u>h</u>at Sefarim</em>, 21).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zohar-Pritzker-Eleven-Joel-Hecker/dp/0804784507">Volume 11 c</a>ontains sections that have received the label <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em>—<em>Shir ha-Shirim</em>, <em>Rut</em>, and <em>Eikhah</em>—but they do not necessarily match the model of <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on the Torah.</p>
<p><em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on <em>Shir ha-Shirim</em> may be a fragment of a larger work, now lost, and it bears some of the characteristics typical of <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on the Torah: multiple rabbinic figures; mix of Hebrew and Aramaic; allegorical interpretations; and with only slight use of kabbalistic symbolism.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> How does <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam </em>fit into the formation of the Zohar?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Gershom Scholem argued that the entire <em>Zohar</em> was written by Moshe de Leon, a prolific 13<sup>th</sup> century kabbalist, including the earliest strata of the <em>Zohar </em>to the latest—from the work called <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> through the sections called the <em>Idrot</em>—even though many difficulties remained with this broad-brush thesis.</p>
<p>In the late 1980’s Yehudah Liebes, one of our generation’s foremost academic <em>Zohar</em> experts concluded that while Moshe de Leon may have been the primary author of the Zoharic compendium, he also served as editor, incorporating the works of others with whom he did not necessarily agree.</p>
<p>And for some time this new approach was adopted by scholarly consensus. Over the last decade there have been three primary responses to Liebes’ thesis.</p>
<p>Some scholars, many of them Liebes’ Hebrew University students, fine-tuned his argument, suggesting that there is another stratum of Zoharic literature. While the old topography of the <em>Zohar</em>’s textual composition had three stages—1. <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em>; 2. Epic Layer of the <em>Zohar</em> (<em>Zohar</em> on the Torah); 3. <em>Tiqqunei Zohar</em> &amp; <em>Ra’aya Mehemna</em>—according to the new scheme another layer intervened between numbers 2 &amp; 3, and this came to be called the mediating or middle layer, i.e. the stratum written after most of the <em>Zohar</em> had been written.</p>
<p>To speak historically, we currently use a basic four-part scheme of authorship:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on the Torah;</li>
<li>Epic Layer of the <em>Zohar</em> (Meroz’s name for <em>guf ha-Zohar</em>);</li>
<li>a mediating period before <em>Tiqqunei Zohar</em> and <em>Raya Mehemna</em>, containing parts of Saba of Mishpatim, Yanoqa, <em>Zohar Shir ha-Shirim</em>, <em>Idrot</em>, <em>Sifra di-Tseni’uta</em>, <em>Matnitin, Tosefta</em> (and more);</li>
<li><em>Tiqqunei Zohar</em> and <em>Raya Mehemna</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A second response to Liebes’ thesis has been pushed primarily by Ronit Meroz through careful study of Zoharic manuscripts in comparison with other contemporary (14<sup>th</sup> century) kabbalists. She has suggested that <em>Sitrei Torah</em> came from the pen of Rabbi Yaakov Shatz, and that large sections of <em>Zohar <u>H</u>adash</em> came from Rabbi Yosef Angelet. These assignations are intriguing but probably require further investigation. The possibility remains that the <em>Zohar</em> texts and their “sister” texts may have had a source in common rather than originating from the same author.</p>
<p>A third response has been that of Daniel Abrams who argues that the <em>Zohar</em> is more a collection of literary phenomena bearing accretions and losses evolving over centuries into the anthology now called <em>Zohar</em>. For Abrams, Zoharic authorship is chimerical, and the best we can hope for is to observe trends of development over time through assiduous examination of the manuscripts.</p>
<p>The scholarship of Yehuda Liebes and Ronit Meroz has been very helpful in tracking down textual affinities between texts that appear in the printed <em>Zohar</em> and works written by kabbalists living in the late 13<sup>th</sup>-early 14<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Affinities may not prove authorship, however, and may demonstrate a relationship of source and target, or perhaps only that these authors and the <em>Zohar</em> as it emerges both drew on similar sources.</p>
<p>Even then, since the earliest identified manuscript that contains substantial Zoharic material was written at the beginning of the 15<sup>th</sup> century (and owned by Sabbatai Zevi!), there is at least 100 years of redaction before we have substantial amounts of Zoharic texts.</p>
<p>While there is little doubt that much of the conceptual and literary work would have been written in the decades between, say, 1280 and 1310, what existed at that time is like a black box buried at the bottom of the sea, or a rumored lost train carrying a fortune in gold lost in mountainous regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p><strong>3) How was <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> Ruth originally considered a separate book? </strong></p>
<p><em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on <em>Rut</em> was first printed under the titles <em>Yesod Shirim</em> and <em>Tapu<u>h</u>ei Zahav</em> (Thiengen 1559) without any reference to the Zoharic corpus. While the frontispiece of one of the first two printings (Cremona 1558) referred to <em>Midrash Rut</em>, only small parts of the work appear there. Ultimately it was published in 1658 in <em>Zohar <u>H</u>adash</em> under the title <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> <em>Rut</em>.</p>
<p><em>MhN Rut</em> is a shaggy dog of a text. I have often thought of it as a duffle bag into which all kinds of materials could be stuffed; indeed, this says something about the nature of redaction of kabbalistic texts in general.</p>
<p><em>MhN</em> <em>Rut</em> cannot be said to have a clear message, per se. Many rabbis are quoted in it, which is a feature of <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> in general, without the central figure of Rabbi Shimon bar Yo<u>h</u>ai and his cohort. It has stories about dreams, long passages about the various compartments of hell and the details of the tortures that go on there; it contains one of the versions of the popular story of the Tanna and the Restless Dead, a story that inspired the practice of children reciting Kaddish (and other parts of the liturgy) after a parent’s death.</p>
<p>The story enjoyed wide circulation in over forty versions in medieval folktales, liturgical works, midrash, ethical literature, and Kabbalah, but its best known source is from medieval Ashkenaz, where dreams and the fear of hell are frequent tropes.</p>
<p>It is interested in the nature of the soul. And, of course, there is a fair amount of allegorical and kabbalistic interpretation of the story of Ruth.</p>
<p>Noteworthy in <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on<em> Rut</em> is the reliance on late, small midrashim published by Jellinek and Eisenstein. Much of the material regarding Geihinnom draws upon <em>Masekhet Geihinnom</em>, <em>Masekhet <u>H</u>ibbut ha-Qever</em>; on the fetus it gleans from <em>Seder Yetsirat ha-Vlad</em>; and on the martyrology from Heikhalot literature, but also from <em>Elleh Ezkerah</em>.</p>
<p>It is one of the ironies of <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on<em> Rut</em> that while the biblical Book of Ruth is classically treated as a story of conversion and of a non-Jewish woman’s dedication to the people of Israel and their God, this section of the <em>Zohar</em> demonstrates its ambivalence and hostility toward non-Jews, and Christians and Muslims in particular. The <em>Zohar</em>’s ethnocentrism and xenophobia is prominently on display here.</p>
<p><strong>4)      Describe <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> Lamentations.</strong></p>
<p><em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam on</em> <em>Eikhah</em> is a beautiful, pathos-filled work that stands alone, but it was not published independently as was the case with <em>MhN, Rut</em>. The first part of the work is structured as dueling claims to greater suffering between the residents of Jerusalem and the residents of Bavel. The debate follows a trope established in a piyyut written by Solomon ibn Gabirol between two fictional wives of Israel, each suffering neglect. Here the winner will claim the right to offer a eulogy for Jerusalem after Her destruction.</p>
<p>The work draws on <em>Eikhah Rabbah</em>, but has a light overlay of kabbalistic symbolism, focusing on the absence of both the blessed Holy One, signifying <em>Tif’eret</em>, who abandoned the people of Israel, but <em>Shekhinah</em> too is absent.</p>
<p>It draws upon <em>Eikhah Rabbah</em>’s famous midrash that describes Rachel crying from her tomb in Bethlehem, refusing to be consoled over her children’s exile and suffering. While <em>MhN</em>, <em>Eikhah</em> strikes the same emotional tones as <em>Eikhah Rabbah</em>, the artistic skill of the authorship lies in the rereading of rabbinic midrash that seamlessly retrojects kabbalistic myth into the earlier material; or, put differently, elaborates literarily the mythos that is quietly embedded within the rabbinic texts.</p>
<p><strong>5)   What are your differences in translation from those of Daniel Matt?</strong></p>
<p>One of the aims of <em>The Zohar: Pritzker Edition</em> was to maintain stylistic consistency throughout the 12 volumes and, indeed, originally Daniel Matt was originally hired to do all twelve—but Nathan Wolski and I were hired so that the project would be completed before 2022. While the careful reader can detect stylistic changes over the course of the nine volumes written by Daniel Matt, there is impressive consistency. Nathan and I were charged with the task of trying to sustain that consistency and I found little temptation to fiddle with a winning formula. That said, here and there one can find idiosyncratic divergences, particularly in my commentary.</p>
<p>I received rabbinical training at Yeshiva University and, as a result, there were times where I chased down halakhic issues that were of interest to me.</p>
<p>For example, I was interested in the issue of the three words that are repeated at the end of the <em>Shema</em>, as treated in <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on <em>Rut</em>. <em>Midrash Tanhuma </em>on <em>Tazri’a</em> teaches that there are 248 words in the liturgical <em>Shema</em>, corresponding to the 248 limbs of the human body.</p>
<p>Bracketing the anatomical question, any brash 5<sup>th</sup> grader would challenge this teaching, noting that there are in fact only 245 words contained in the <em>Shema</em>’s three paragraphs. Hasidei Ashkenaz were deeply interested in numerical aspects of the liturgy and, confronted by this apparent contradiction, suggested that one could say the three words <em>El Melekh Ne’eman</em>, a putative expansion of the word <em>Amen</em>, after the blessing before the <em>Shema</em> and immediately preceding the <em>Shema</em>. Thus is the numerical discrepancy resolved.</p>
<p>We do not know about the pervasiveness of this innovative practice, but both Ramban and Rashba felt called upon to object, emphasizing that reciting these words, even if they are only an expansion of the “acronym Amen” constitute an impermissible interruption between the blessing before the <em>Shema</em> and the recital act itself. They did not propose any other solution to the problem, apparently indicating a lack of concern for the midrash’s inaccuracy.</p>
<p>The battle over this issue did not subside, however, and a passage in the printed version of <em>Midrash ha-Ne’lam</em> on <em>Rut</em> offered a unique solution: repeat the last two words of the <em>Shema</em> (<em>Adonai Eloheikhem</em>) plus the first word of the subsequent blessing (<em>Emet</em>). Yet another solution had been offered, however, and that was to repeat the last three words of the <em>Shema</em> (<em>Ani Adonai Eloheikhem</em>).</p>
<p>Medieval Spanish Talmud commentators and poskim in the late 13<sup>th</sup> and early 14<sup>th</sup> centuries quarreled over this issue (as documented by Israel Ta-Shma). From my examination of <em>Zohar</em> manuscripts and consideration of variants in the different works of Moses de León that dealt with the same issue, I concluded that the <em>Zohar</em>’s original position was to repeat the words <em>ani YHVH Eloheikhem</em> (the “losing” position in halakhic history), and that scribes subsequently <em>“corrected”</em> the <em>Zohar</em> in light of the emerging halakhah.</p>
<p>I believe that I have also differed slightly from Matt in terms of some key word choices and emphases. Thus I was more likely to translate <em>yir’ah</em> as “fear” rather than “awe.” Similarly, I often characterized kabbalistic interests as “pious” rather than “spiritual.”</p>
<p><strong>6)      What Poetic principles do you follow in your translation? </strong></p>
<p>Following Danny Matt’s model for the series, I have tried to produce a translation that is both “literal yet poetic.” The translator’s line between replicating the feel of a foreign language and rebirthing the text in a different vernacular is inevitably individual and sometimes fuzzy. One of the problems in creating a translation is that there is no such thing as a word-for-word translation. No two languages correspond so neatly that one could pull off this feat.</p>
<p>A recent estimate puts the numbers of words and roots in the <em>Zohar</em> at roughly 6,000, while the average North American with a graduate school education has close to ten times that number in her vocabulary. Indeed, Gershom Scholem wrote that “It remains to be added that the author&#8217;s vocabulary is extremely limited, so that one never escapes a feeling of surprise at his ability to express so much with the aid of so little” (<em>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism</em>, 163–65).</p>
<p>While the <em>Zohar</em> does not feel flat-footed, if one were to reproduce its iterative quality in English, the result would feel pedestrian. Many words are repeated but with subtle (and not-so-subtle) nuances and variations; the richness of English can reproduce these distinctions using different words.</p>
<p>Thus in Daniel Matt’s working dictionary for his volumes of the translation (an enormously helpful tool), he lists almost forty words or phrases to translate the root <em>a<u>h</u>d</em> (or <em>a<u>h</u>id</em>, <em>ita<u>h</u>id</em>) whose simple meaning is “grasp” or “hold.” Similarly, the root <em>qym</em> (“exist, stand, abide”) in its various forms has well over one hundred possible entries, as does <em>slq</em> (“rise, ascend, depart, disappear”).</p>
<p><strong>7) Can you give examples of your poetics?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the poetic moves that I have adopted include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dash—Often replaces words such as אינון (“they”) or  דא(“this”) or אלין (“these”). This move compresses and tightens the English text, providing more punch.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Exclamation marks—The dialogue of the <em>Zohar</em>’s fictional kabbalists is frequently punctuated with expressions of astonishment, delight, and dismay. The addition of this simple punctuation mark accentuates the literary experience and emphasizes the affective tone of the text’s characters.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Elimination of the definite article yields compactness, poetry, personification, and mythicization.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>An attempt to reproduce alliteration or patterns of repetition where possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alliteration and repetition are frequent literary features in the <em>Zohar</em>. Sometimes there is a greater literary payoff by mimicking the Aramaic repetitions in English, and sometimes a better effect is achieved through varying the terms. Using alliteration in the English (“power and potency”) is a poetic act that provides some of the feel of the text even if it is not a precise echo of the specific sounds.</p>
<p>Commenting on Ezekiel’s vision (Ezekiel 1:16), the author of <em>Zohar</em> <em>Shir ha-Shirim</em> (63b) writes: “Its flame flares momentarily, flickering. Sparkles revolve, one shimmer entering the other.”</p>
<p>Sometimes a term carries two possible meanings and I opted to use two terms rather than simply one to convey the meaning. Thus (<em>Zohar <u>H</u>adash</em>, <em>Shir ha-Shirim</em> 63c) as “When he approached her later and Seth was born, the world became stabilized and fragrant with the righteous and saintly ones who came into the world afterward.” The root <em>bsm</em> carries both senses of “stabilized” or “established” and “fragrant.” Danny Matt has translated this term as “fragrantly firm,” but that didn’t work for me.</p>
<p>As to repetition, sometimes I opted to translate the same term with multiple words as a way of enhancing the experience. I translated a passage in <em>Zohar <u>H</u>adash</em>, <em>Shir ha-Shirim</em> 62c as follows: “Come and see. When Israel are righteous, the supernal Throne of Glory ascends in teeming delight, in an abundance of love, higher and higher… All worlds are saturated, blessed, and sanctified with a profusion of blessings, brimming with sanctities. Then the blessed Holy One rejoices with them in total rapture.” Here, I have translated the word <em>kamah </em>in four different ways (teeming, abundant, profusion, brimming) as a way of capturing the plenitude that the language itself suggests.</p>
<p>And yet at other times the repetition works well: “In this manner, <em>The Song of Songs of Solomon</em>, ascending in bliss, descending in bliss, joining in bliss—all the worlds in bliss.” Repeating the word “bliss” (bliss, bliss, bliss, bliss) has its own sensual qualities.</p>
<p><strong>8)      Why is Zohar Song of Songs important and special?</strong></p>
<p>Following Rabbi Akiva’s famous statement in <em>Mishnah Yadayim</em> (3:5) that “All of scripture is holy, but Song of Songs is holy of holies,” Jewish traditions have treated the love song as an allegory for love that transcends the love of young lovers, as an allegory for the love between God and Israel; love between the individual soul and God; and in kabbalah, as a symbol for the love between the masculine and feminine potencies of Divinity. It is hard to overstate the pervasive influence of the Song of Songs on the <em>Zohar</em> as a whole, as the Song’s themes suffuse the Zoharic corpus.</p>
<p>The <em>Zohar</em> on the Song of Songs represents the Zoharic authorship in its most mature phase—masterful in exegetical craft, soaring in its rhetoric. As noted above, the <em>Zohar</em> on the Song of Songs contains material that is similar to the interests of the later strata of the <em>Zohar</em>, <em>Raya Mehemna</em> and <em>Tiqqunei Zohar</em> (specifically the letter mysticism). It also appears to be familiar with some of the <em>Zohar</em>’s favorite themes, and re-renders them skillfully.</p>
<p>The literary framework for much of the text is an exchange of mystical homilies between Rabbi Shimon son of Yo<u>h</u>ai and the prophet Elijah, running a sustained commentary on Song of Songs 1:1–11. For many of the first homilies, each speaker demonstrates a thematic consistency: Rabbi Shim’on’s teachings are about ascent (within the <em>sefirot</em> or of the individual soul), while Elijah’s deal with the ruptures caused by the presence of the demonic Other Side, human transgression, and the ways in which evil is overcome and harmony restored.</p>
<p>Much of the latter part of this large work transposes the romance of the Song onto the exalted plane of masculine and feminine letters that are the fundaments of reality, with an overarching theme in both speakers concerning the restoration of linguistic and divine harmony.</p>
<p>In this text, as in much of the <em>Zohar</em>, the demonic Other Side is a personification of the current of evil and judgment that runs through humanity and the world. Evil is understood (in strong contrast to Maimonides) as a real force in humanity, but also as a celestial force, corresponding to Divinity though inferior in stature. This modified dualism has anthropological consequences, raising the stakes that appear in Bahya ibn Paquda’s <em><u>H</u>ovot ha-Levavot</em>, in which every human action is a step toward holiness or sin. For the <em>Zohar</em>, these fateful steps result in one abiding in one dimension of reality or another—the holy or the demonic. This dualism has metaphysical significance as well, inasmuch as it calls for a recasting of the Neoplatonic approaches that were popular at the time.</p>
<p><strong>9)   What are the Matnitin and Tosefta? </strong></p>
<p>The<em> Matnitin</em> (“Our Mishnah”) and <em>Tosefta </em>(“Addenda”) sections of the Zohar corpus consist mostly of anonymous enigmatic revelations. These two sections have different names, but are identical in style, imagery, and tone. Their primary interests are the process of emanation; the development of the soul; and the role of the forces of judgment and evil.</p>
<p>These striking, compact passages, often have oracular, hortatory voices that call upon sleeping humanity to awaken from their spiritual slumber in order to learn the esoteric truths of Torah and God’s inner being. Their style is terse, dramatic, and at times rhythmic, suggesting that some of them may have been chanted to induce mystical consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Matnitin</em> and <em>Tosefta</em> show strong familiarity with a range of Zoharic themes, and this led R. Yaakov Emden first, and then later Scholem and Tishby to characterize them as early compositions—just as the terse style of the Mishnah leads to the expansive discussions of the Gemara. I agree with Daniel Abrams’ position that it is more likely that the authors wrote them with many Zoharic texts before them.</p>
<p>The use of neologisms in these sections heightens their sense of mystery and allure—often derived from Greek, Latin, Persian, or Arabic—and made these sections the most fun to translate. Several examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Glow of ten flowing streams” renders קוזטיפא דהרדינא עשרא דאפקותא (<em>qoztifa de-ha-redina asara de-afquta</em>), (V206, 331a). The neologism <em>qoztifa</em> apparently implies projection or flow. See the expression קסטיפא דשמשא (<em>qastifa de-shimsha</em>), “ray of the sun” (<em>Zohar</em> 3:283b); and the Arabic root <em>qdf</em>, “to throw.” The word רדינא (<em>redina</em>), or perhaps הרדינא (<em>hardina</em>), is utterly cryptic and probably a corruption, but it may derive from the root רדי (<em>rdy</em>), “flow, liquefy.”</li>
<li>“Lusters” renders קסטורין (<em>qastorin</em>) (<em>Zohar</em> 1:232b), apparently derived from קסיטרא (<em>qasitra</em>) and Greek <em>kassiteros</em>, “tin.” “Constricted caissons” renders טסקורי קמיטין (<em>tasqurei qemitin</em>); alternatively, “furrowed forms” or “tautened templates.” The strange word <em>tasqurei</em> appears nowhere else in the <em>Zohar</em>, or classical or medieval rabbinic literature. The author may have in mind the other Zoharic neologism טסקוסאי (<em>tasqosa’ei</em>) on <em>Zohar</em> 2:234b where טסקוסאי (<em>tasqosa’ei</em>) is linked with <em>Targum Yonatan</em>, Ezekiel 43:10: טקוסיה (<em>tiqquseih</em>), “its pattern” (recorded in <em>Bei’ur ha-Millim ha-Zarot</em> as טסקוסטיה [<em>tisqusteih</em>]), deriving from Greek <em>taxis</em>, “arrangement, order.”</li>
<li>I translated קולפי בסיכתא (<em>qulfei de-sikketa</em>) (1:232a) as “nail-studded (or flanged, spiked) clubs.” The singular form קולפא (<em>qulpa</em>), “club,” derives from the Persian <em>kūpāl</em>, “club, lance.”</li>
</ol>
<p>10)    <strong>What is the Sitrei Torah? </strong></p>
<p><em>Sitrei Torah</em> is the title given to a collection of Zohar passages from the later period that are mostly connected to the book of Genesis, but the title is also sometimes used in manuscripts and by early commentators to refer to texts that appear without that title elsewhere. In other words, it is a somewhat generic title that is applied somewhat randomly. A central focus of these passages is the power of the demonic Other Side.</p>
<p>11)   <strong>Why should we study Zohar?</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Zohar</em> has charmed its readers because of its literary richness, its acute midrashic eye, and for the lush interlacing of Tanakh, midrash, halakhah, aggadah, medieval philosophy, and kabbalah. It is a poetic, visionary masterpiece whose system—both structured and fluid—offers shining religious homilies. Encompassing the entirety of Judaism, its narratives and mysterious characters confer a quality of both mystery and familiarity, and an aura of authenticity even as it is endlessly creative.  The flow from one set of symbols is seductive, and induces in the reader a desire to participate in its associative process.</p>
<p>For today’s spiritual seeker, Hasidut is often more accessible because it is more expressly psychological, and has usually dropped the arcana of <em>sefirot</em>, angels, demonic forces, etc. Each spiritual seeker, of course, will find the practices, texts, and forms of contemplation best suited to her or him.</p>
<p>12)   <strong>How does the Zohar influence your spiritual life? </strong></p>
<p>The <em>Zohar</em> strongly informs my spirituality and the religious intentions that I bring to my Torah study, prayer, and observance of <em>mitsvot</em>, but I do not regard myself as a mystic. The religious <em>imaginaire</em> supplied by the <em>Zohar</em> fills my brain, but it is not the only constellation that guides me. And yet, a large tetragrammaton graces the door of my study serving as a focus for visualization during davenning, inspired by my study of the <em>Zohar</em>.</p>
<p>When I first read through the entire <em>Zohar</em> in the early 90’s, I would spend hours every morning reading large chunks of text. Then I would take a walk down the block to Riverside Park and everything appeared differently: sun, sky, birds, trees, etc. all carried symbolic weight, having become portals onto Divinity itself.</p>
<p>After several months of immersion in the <em>Zohar</em>’s letter mysticism, I received an <em>aliyah</em> at shul. Nothing mystical occurred, but my relationship to those letters, parchment, and the entire text had been transformed, and I was filled with reverence and awe.</p>
<p>13)   <strong>What do you do with the nasty parts of the Zohar? </strong></p>
<p>When saying kaddish after my father died several years ago, I thought frequently about the <em>Zohar</em>’s injunctions to say Kaddish and other public rituals to save the deceased from Hell, along with the <em>Zohar</em>’s extensive descriptions of the various compartments and sufferings of Hell. Literal readings of those texts have no purchase on my religious thinking. While I feel deeply religious, my academic training, extending back to a B.A. in English Literature at the University of Toronto, has inculcated in me a ironic distance between me and any text.  Moreover, I am aware that any and all texts I read are filtered through my own subjectivity, and through the broad range of Jewish religious texts with which I have spent time.</p>

				<p>In 1964, Bob Dylan sang <em>Times are a Changing</em> reflecting the growing tide of youth wanting a different world than that of their elders. Five years later in 1969, Theodore Roszak published his classic work <em>The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition </em>explaining how the younger generation was a counterculture to excepted values. Roszak found common ground between political radicals, hippie dropouts and the Beatles by aptly linking Herbert Marcuse, Norman O. Brown, Allen Ginsberg and Paul Goodman. In all of them, Roszak found a rejection of what he calls the technocracy&#8211;the regime of corporate and technological expertise that dominates industrial society.” This revolt was credited with reaching into the very meaning of life, sanity, reality, and cultural values.  Roszak was more a participant writing a manifesto than an abstract scholar, his work introduced a kaleidoscope of what was being read on many college campuses while at the same time offer a compelling vision of the entire movement for his readers.</p>
<p>Smadar Cherlow recently published <a href="http://www.resling.co.il/book.asp?book_id=896"><em>Who Moved My Judaism: Judaism Post-Modernism, and Contemporary Spirituality</em> [Hebrew]</a> (Resling, 2016) showing the growing tide of change in the Religious Zionist community, comparing it to the American counter-culture. The book offers guidance for navigating these new trends, and like Roszak it is part reporting and part advocacy.</p>
<p>She <a href="https://musaf-shabbat.com/2013/06/14/%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A2-%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9F/">herself recounts in interviews</a> how she attended Gush Emunim rallies in the 1970’s and over time under the influence of Rabbi Menachem Froman and Rabbi Shagar came to her new position as advocate for a new religiosity. In short, the world of Gush Emunim, especially the Rabbi Zvi Yehudah Kook worldview broke down. She calls this breakdown post-modernism because of the loss of the grand narrative and she sees it replaced by a new spirituality.</p>

<p>The chapters of the book originate as independent talks given at Religious Zionist conferences and public forums. Cherlow acknowledges her dual role of academic observer of these trends and participant formulating an ideology,</p>
<p><a href="../../../../2013/02/13/smadar-cherlow-rabbi-kooks-secret-mission-and-mystical-experience-review-by-tomer-persico/index.html">Cherlow’s prior book</a> presented Rav Abraham Isaac Kook as a mystic in touch with God who thought he had prophecy and a mission from God.  In the debate around her thesis, including a critic by Rav Yoel Bin-Nun. She declared that she gives more deference to personal experience over philosophy and thought, personally and in her reading of texts.</p>
<p>The vision of this book concerns the current prominent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesder">Hesder yeshivot</a> in which the students spend at least half of the day studying Kabbalah, Hasidut, Jewish thought, midrash, meditation and prayer, academic books in Jewish studies and Western thought helpful to understand God and religion such as Plato and Spinoza Afternoon study time could be entirely Tania, Rav Nachman, and Lurianic Writings. Night time study can be Jewish Sufism, Feldenkrais, Franz Rosenzweig, and poetry writing. They can display their copies of Buddhist works next to their copies of Maimonides and have ponytails, dress in funky clothes, walk barefoot and plan their trips to India. These trends are not isolated phenomena in that even those attending the Yeshivot Ha-Kav, those strictly keeping to the Rabbi Zvi Yehudah Kook approach spend time visiting their friends and classmates in the spirituality yeshivot.</p>
<p>In order to make sense of this new phenomenon, I can recommend nothing better than the first chapter of Smadar Cherlow’s book. The chapter offers phantasmagorical and impressionist display of these new trends.  The chapter answers the basic questions that an observer would have on the new spirituality and it has extensive resources in the footnotes This chapter should serve as a basis for any further discussion because its strong intuitive weave from an insiders perspective of this new type of yeshiva.</p>
<p>In chapter one, Cherlow describes the importance of the beit midrash (study hall) as the crucial place of spiritual formation and religious life. Quoting Levinas, she claims that there is a level where we love Torah more than God, or at least our first commitment is to the life of the Beit Midrash, the life of the yeshiva.</p>
<p>But in the post-modern era there are no truth claims to this activity, or at least one cannot ask for truth claims or justifications; there is no grand narrative. Building on the Rabbinic homily of “we will do as prior to we will listen” becomes a greater commitment to observance and the life of Torah study than any justification or systematic theology.</p>
<p>Yet, we all seek personal meaning and experience as primary in our lives. Rav Shagar taught us to treat the study hall in a multi-perspective way of different styles of learning, bringing academic and contemporary topics as well as mysticism. The texts studied have changed, the purpose of learning has changed and the style has changed. (see my prior post on <a href="../../../../2011/09/02/rav-shagar-btorato-yehageh-the-study-of-talmud-as-a-quest-for-god-part-i/index.html">Rav Shagar  &amp; Torah Study</a>)</p>
<p>She writes that now we spend much of the day in the new Yeshivot studying Zohar, hasidut, song, midrash, philosophy, and poetry. We seek an embodied spirituality that includes sessions of body movement and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feldenkrais_Method">Feldenkrais Method</a> in order to repair impaired connections between the brain and body and so improve our psychological state. We also have sessions devoted marriage therapy especially to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imago_therapy">Imago Therapy</a> created by Harville Hendrix in his 1988 book,<em> Getting the Love You Want, A Guide for Couples.</em></p>
<p>The new yeshivot are built in a circle to show that we are a collective not a hierarchy. The learning is more dialogical and a conversation. It is therapeutic and transformative. These new yeshivot follow Martin Buber’s ideas of mutuality between participants seeking an I-thou relationship in all interactions.</p>
<p>They encourage free reading of Bible, Talmud and Midrash without any commentators. How does the text speak to you? What to you hear in the text? How do you apply it?</p>
<p>In both Breslov Hasidic texts and Izbitzer Hasidic texts, there are passages that said that there are new innovations in Torah every day. The goal in the new Yeshivot  is to hear them and write them. You have to have an intimate relationship with the text, an eros toward the text, so that it will speak to you. There are now  musar lectures in these yeshivot about the need to  get the text to speak to you. In turn, the lectures (shiurim) of the Rabbis are to be psychotherapeutic. They are to offer what people need psychologically, with a free play of language and ideas.</p>
<p>The new Beit midrash embraces mediation and new age practices. They eagerly read and follow the writings of the renewal rabbi, Reb Zalman Schachter Shalomi and his followers. She praises Rabbi Dov Zinger who teaches meditative and spiritual practices to aid prayer in his <em>Beit Midrash leHitchadshut</em>. And she points out that the schools accept that the guys with have long hair, and pony tails, and earrings.</p>
<p>Cherlow asks: If we do all these things and follow Reb Zalmann then how is our approach not renewal or new age? She answers because we stay in the beit midrash, that it is the importance of the beit midrash and texts to ground us and give us context. We remain a beit midrash movement focused on learning Talmud and halakhah and the study is done under trained Rabbis. We are learning Talmudic texts but we can also pray on a topic or turn a text into a prayer.</p>
<p>She asks: Is it still Torah study?</p>
<p>Cherlow answers that the study method of Volozhin Lamdanut was a modernist project of rationality to make Torah study scientific and analytic, the goal was to make Torah methodical, rational and orderly. Now in the era of New age – Post-Modern world, we use different language and have different goals. Learning now is more an act of playfulness and a language game. Today Torah study is more similar to the multi-vocal subversive play of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivalesque">Carnivalesque </a>as presented by a Bakhtin, an open performance, speaking in different registries and different languages.   It is now the New Age as presented by the academic work by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Age-Movement-Celebration-Sacralization/dp/0631193324">Paul Heelas </a>who describes it as &#8220;an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life&#8221; which are put together in radically individual and democratic ways.</p>
<p>She says that one can see this change in Torah as is a change of era between modern and post-modern or if one does not accept a change of era then it is two different games with different completely different rules.</p>
<p>Is this major change progress or a regression?</p>
<p>Cherlow notes that for the world of Yeshivat Har Etzion and those it influenced, this is clearly a regression. Amnon Bazak wrote an article, or maybe a screed if you disagree, rejecting all these changes, their method and their results.  But Cherlow responds that this new method is transformational and gives greater meaning to Torah. We change Torah in different times. In this new method of learning Torah for our era, we are creating a transformative new self.</p>
<p>Chapter one has an important appendix on the importance of Rav Shagar for this new method.</p>
<p>In Smadar Cherlow’s encapsulation, Rabbi Joseph D. Soloveitchik taught his students not to look for meaning and Rav Shagar changed everything by telling his students to look for meaning.  This quest for meaning and religious experience may seem close to the Hasidic quest for God but Rav Shagar helped us realize that the actual historical phenomena and practices of Hasidism as well as the current Haredi Hasidic community is not a path for the religious Zionist world which embraces the world. This is a new Post-Modern &amp; New Age theology not another form of Neo-Hasidism; Americans take note.</p>
<p>She tells the story of the early Hasidic master Zusha who never got to actually learn Gemara since the moment he started to read Tractate Berachot which open with the words “From when can we recite the Shema?”   he would immediately ask: ‘From When’  means that God makes requests on us. So he would then ponder: What does God want from us in life?  Cherlow answers that there is a fine line between too much focus on meaning and too little focus. We are coming to correct a lack of focus on meaning.</p>
<p>To find meaning we turn to the wider world and a wider grasp of the world. We try to talk less and experiment and pray more. Sometimes Feldenkrais, sometimes Rav Nachman, sometimes song, and other times current events. The goal is to foster a different relationship with students that is more open in order let them find their own path.</p>
<p>Rav Kook responded to modernity and now we respond to post-modernity.  Rav Kook’s idea of a new Torah of the land of Israel (Torat Eretz Yisrael)  for our time means to incorporate love, play , and imagination. She returns to this topic in Chapter 5 where she explains how we need to replace Rav Kook with Rav Nachman in our studies. And we need to be open in our approach, not judgmental.</p>
<p>All that was in chapter one. It may not reflect any one Yeshiva and it may not be an anthropological description of what you would see in these yeshivot, but it captures an ethos.</p>
<p>I will briefly look at the other chapters which are specific stand-alone papers.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 deals with prayer after modernity.  Modernity killed prayer but Postmodernity brought prayer back. Modern man was like Prometheus challenging God with his belief in his own powers, in response religion was about the divine sanction for human accomplishment and at the same time it sought to overcome alienation from God. In contrast, in the postmodern period we look to Rav Nachman to turn completely to God. We now have new forms of prayer, we have integrated meditation and we call out to God from the heart in our own words.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 deals with messianism. Zionism was a great messianic project. Now we no longer sense that God is controlling history or that we live in a messianic age. We now live in an age of the eclipse of God as described by Martin Buber and we have no grand history or theodicy after Auschwitz as taught by Emmanuel Levinas. We no longer have a national sense and national redemption as taught by of Rav Kook. Rather, we now seek a mystical self-liberation.</p>
<p>Yet, she acknowledges that some in the community still have a messianic sense. However, rather than continue the older messianism of Rav Kook, they seek a radical apocalyptic messianism in active quest of the end of time, seeking to bring the end through their own hands such as Rav Yitzhak Ginzburgh. For Cherlow, Ginsburgh’s fusion of Chabad messianism with settler messianism is extremely potent. They aspire to make Israel into a Jewish monarchy as a return to its ancient glory. Believers must commit themselves to act on behalf of the “wholeness of the land of Israel” and awaken mystical-messianic sparks by their actions. Those actions must include violence against the Amalekite enemy. Required actions also include “revenge” as a means to making the King Messiah live and hastening the coming of his kingdom.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 entitled “From Prometheus to Badulina charts the transition from modernist goal of changing the world to the new age idea of changing ourselves.</p>
<p>She says we now live in a new age of post modernism, post science, and post collective, quoting the aforementioned Paul Heelas on the New Age which she connects to Post-modernism. Rav Shagar offers us a new age of authenticity and individuality (Both of which are classic modernist tropes.)</p>
<p>We are given a glimpse here into Cherlow’s litany of books that are currently being read including Tal ben Shahar on happiness, James Redford, <em>Celestial Prophecy</em> on the change of human consciousness, Jack Kornfeld on creating an engaged and ethical Buddhist meditation practice, the Existentialism of Buber, and Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi’s paradign shift.</p>
<p>Today, we believe in fantasy, the irrational, expecting an apocalyptic appearance of the messiah, traveling to Uman, or seeking personal liberation. Crucial to this chapter is a little book from 1999 called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Badulina-changing-docu-fantasy-inspiring-adventure-ebook/dp/B012SDQ3DE/ref=la_B001JWWUUG_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474004251&amp;sr=1-1">Badolina by Gabi Nitzan</a> which caught the sensibilities of a generation in Israel. Nitzan, once one of Israel&#8217;s most promising young journalists who then dropped out and moved to India</p>
<p>Badolina is the story of a kingdom without laws, without politics, without marriage and without wars. Every resident of Badulina can be the next king. And everyone is brought up on the belief that there are only two ways to live in this world: as a king or as a victim. By projecting their best thoughts and fantasies outward, Badolina&#8217;s residents can use mind over matter and transform reality. The national motto of Badolina – “Better be well and happy than sick and miserable.” So people choose to be happy.</p>
<p>The story line follows a visit to Israel by the king and queen of Badolina, who try to teach Israelis to stop seeing themselves as victims and begin taking responsibility for their lives. If you crave a gourmet meal while wandering in the desert, wish and it will happen; if you want peace in the Middle East, let go of your fears and allow your optimism to create it.</p>
<p>She says that not all of this is good illuminating it by quoting various critics: the critique of neo-liberal consumer capitalism from the Israeli author Gadi Taub (2002), the  critique of the American 1970’s from the classic work by Christopher Lasch <em>The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations </em>(1979) and the critique of contemporary spirituality Jeremy R Carrette, <em>Selling Spirituality</em> (2004).</p>
<p>She compares all of this to the American 1960’s Age of Aquarius. But is it similar to Roszak description of the counterculture?</p>
<p>We see a problematic pattern here among Israeli authors on New Age and Post-Modernism. Whereas we in the United States do not consider the spirituality of the 30’s 60’s 70’s, 80’s. 90’s and 00’s as all the same proto -new age and proto-post modernism, most Israeli authors have a clean before and after, the nation building collective modernism of Zionism and Rav Kook’s Religious Zionism transformed into a new age post modernism of individualism.</p>
<p>But, no educated American would consider Buber, Kafka, Freud, or pop-psych as postmodernism. In addition, we in the United States do not associate spiritual optimistic anti-scientific new age thinking with our age of globalization and media technology.</p>
<p>In fact, British- American culture threw off the world of post-Hegelian idealism before WWI with William James, Franz Boas, James Joyce and Virginia Wolff. It then had many decades of modernism.  In contrast, Religious Zionist culture labels the 19<sup>th</sup> century modernism including the 20<sup>th</sup> century rationalists but they place all 20<sup>th</sup> century romantics and Existentialists with the post-modernists.</p>
<p>And as I have noted elsewhere, many Israelis consider everything 1960-2016 as New Age based on the abstractions in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Age-Movement-Celebration-Sacralization/dp/0631193324">Paul Heelas <em>The New Age Movement. The Celebration of the Self and the Sacralization of Modernity</em> (1996) </a>which characterized the New Age movement as &#8220;an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life&#8221; which can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of &#8220;the same (or very similar) lingua franca to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be transformed&#8221;. For an academic treatment of New Age in Israel with a sensitivity to sociological method and local concerns, one should see the <a href="https://www.academia.edu/4145393/Ph.D._Dissertation_-_An_English_Summary_and_Content">dissertation</a> and <a href="https://www.academia.edu/4046468/Current_Jewish_Spiritualities_in_Israel_A_New_Age">articles </a>of <a href="https://ruahmidbare.wordpress.com/">Marianna Ruah-Midbar.</a></p>
<p>Concerning Post-Modernism, for Cherlow it seems to hinge on Lyotatd’s saying the grand narrative has broken, which in their case means the Rav Kook narrative broke. But they certainly do not accept in any way the death of self, the construction of reality, or the turn to text over self. Nor would one confuse Derrida, Foucault and Lyotard with anything New Age. One of the work’s most egregious misunderstandings of the book is thinking that Foucault would only consider political authors like Rabbi Y. Ginzburgh as concerned with power, when in fact his critique is that everything ever written including this book is about power.</p>
<p>In the 1960’s, the American counter culture as described by Roszak was about running from centaurs to safety, the best minds were being driven mad by the establishment and studied “Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah&#8230;.”; they sought out alternative realities in India, Jerusalem, and Naropa.</p>
<p>Here in these new yeshivot, we do not have a fleeing mad from a perceived dying civilization, they love the yeshiva and they love learning. Rather, They are a turn to plurality and individualism after idealism. No one is taking over a campus and demanding change of the teachers.</p>
<p>This was a slow change, done over 25 years, led by the students and friends of Rav Shagar and Rav Froman, who since the 1980’s slowly changed yeshivot. The students of the two illustrious Rabbis are already mature teachers in their own right. Even institutions such as Migdal Oz, the woman’s program associated with Yeshivat Har Etzion brings in many of these authors, thinkers, and speakers in order to expose the students to the new trends.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../2015/09/04/interview-with-shlomo-einhorn-judaism-alive/index.html">Popular American outreach and pulpit rabbis</a> can teach motivational literature, pop psych , New Age, and Evangelical ideas as eternal Torah,  and still be conservative religiously. Here too, they are still in the study hall (beit midrash). Besides, even a local Orthodox synagogue here in NJ has started weekly Feldenkrais, in lieu of the more traditional zumba classes.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a new generations of yeshiva teachers who grew up entirely in this system. They are now giving their own yeshiva lectures and training a new generation. I await to see what they produce.</p>
