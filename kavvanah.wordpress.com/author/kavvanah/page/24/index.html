				<p>Sometimes I like reading hagiography, currently called sacred narrative, such as saint, zaddik, or mystic tales, not because of the historical truth or the miracles but because they sometimes reflect a worldview better than explicit statements . Adin Steinsaltz in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Rebbe-Adin-Steinsaltz/dp/1592643817">his new book <em>My Rebbe</em> (Maggid Press, 2014)</a> gives a completely romantic ahistorical account of the Lubavitcher Rebbe that is a good read and offers a few gems of insight. The book is written as a form of world wisdom literature so that it can be excerpted in general spirituality magazines on myth and story such as <a href="http://www.parabola.org/"><em>Parabola,</em> </a>to which Steinsaltz is a frequent contributor. </p>
<p>The book  is a human exploration stressing the universal aspects of the Rebbe as a spiritual hero-  for example think of the books on Rumi or Francis of Assisi, or one of the romantic retellings of the Baal Shem Tov, with chapters with titles like  lover of common people, wagon driver stories, mysticism, and humble beginnings. So too, this book is only loosely arranged chronologically, it is more of a topical arrangement -leadership, adulation, shlichus, outreach, nurturing, farbrengen, politics. The chapters try and capture a human essence of the soul as a personal reflection of Steinsaltz’s relation with the Rebbe. The book goes out of its way to quote Non-Jewish and non-Orthodox sources and combines that with culling fanciful gems from the oral histories.  One important note is that Steinsaltz is a non-messianic, a non &#8220;meshichist.&#8221; </p>
<p>Compared to other books on the Rebbe, this one is smooth, clear, and lacking all local color, the same way Steinsaltz retold Rav Nachman’s tales without any Eastern European detail. This is the exact opposite of the wonderful book by Sue Fishkoff, The Rebbe’s Army which is filled with local color, real stories, and gritty journalistic details. I am sure that those vested in historical study of Chabad will jump to criticize this book with a vengeance but history and documents are beside the point of a sacred narrative of a saint. More importantly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rebbe-Teachings-Menachem-Schneerson-Influential/dp/0062318985">Joseph Telushkin just released what is</a> claimed to be the definite biography of the Rebbe- we shall see the reaction to that book in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>The book tells some good stories and reveals much about Steinsaltz as image creator. Steinsaltz describes Isaiah Leibowitz on the Rebbe and gives a ridiculous story taken from the oral reminiscences about Rav Soloveitchik and the Rebbe. </p>
<blockquote><p>‘I knew him [the Rebbe], but he [later] went crazy.’ The caustic comment was typical of Leibowitz, but in Berlin they were on good terms.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik recalled that he once rescued the rebbe-to-be from jail. It was the joyous day of Purim, and the Rebbe observing the usual practice of the holiday – was on the Humboldt University campus, somewhat tipsy. Climbing onto a chair, Menachem Mendel began to speak loudly about religious observance and the meaning of the holiday. Holding a public event without a permit was illegal, and he was promptly arrested for creating a public disturbance. A man on the scene, a respected physician, telephoned Rabbi Soloveitchik and said something about Schneerson being in jail. After securing his release, Rabbi Soloveitchik joked with Menachem Mendel, telling him that he could now become a rebbe. He had been imprisoned as all of the Lubavitcher rebbes had once been.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a Disney talent for painting evil villains who are predestined to be defeated, Steinsaltz depicted Rabbi Gurary, the family member who was passed over to become Rebbe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike Rabbi Gurary, who was the official head of the schools, the Rebbe’s relationship with the students was personal.<br />
Barry carefully chose the books he took; he did not hurriedly scoop them off a shelf by chance. Because Barry was not a collector himself, he had an ally in Rabbi Chaim Lieberman, one of the former rebbe’s followers who had never fully accepted the new rebbe. He was the librarian who pointed him to the most valuable books. Rebbe Yosef Yitzchak had not left any valuable personal property – goods, real estate or money – after his passing, except for these books. Many were first editions, rare and important works. Barry must have needed the money; within the first two years, he sold over one hundred books.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steinsaltz captures the nature of the Rebbe’s messages, and conversations with the Rebbe for a wide audience.</p>
<blockquote><p>For Rebbe Menachem Mendel, however, stories were a kind of scientific instrument, only useful as they would impart lessons. He did not fill his stories with emotional detail and character analysis. Instead, each story he told had a purpose and a point. When King Midas touched everyday things, they turned to gold. When the Rebbe touched a story, it turned into a lesson.</p>
<p>Chabad’s adulation of the Rebbe is unusual even among the Chasidic movements. In our times, movie stars and rock idols are similarly adored. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, extraordinary individuals were considered geniuses, and sometimes their personae even defined a period. Voltaire is perhaps the best example of such a figure; Goethe is another.</p>
<p>The Rebbe would never flatter. He was always polite and considerate– yet always spoke with authority. He spoke to everyone as a royal personage would speak: polite, attentive and considerate, yet without lowering himself to any extent. Whether he agreed or disagreed with his distinguished guests, he would express his own opinion. The Rebbe was courteous to everyone. In personal meetings, his politeness – which had nobility about it – was particularly remarkable. His courtesy was widely perceived as a true, unguarded expression of his personality.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what went on in the private conversations with the Rebbe or in yechidus? What did he advise? Did the advise work? </p>
<blockquote><p>The Rebbe was always optimistic, and would guide the petitioner to try and see things in this way. When people asked how to repair their misdeeds, he would offer them ways to correct and improve. Mainly he would encourage them to think less about the past, and more of the future, encouraging them to increase their good deeds and focus on positive action. To a woman who despaired and wrote that “all is bad in my life,” the Rebbe responded: “In this world, good and bad are mixed together. One has to choose what to emphasize, what to look at…. In our lives, there are always two ways to see the good that happens to us or the opposite. For us who have a firm belief in the superiority and eternity of the spiritual, the good always wins over the bad. That which is good is everlasting, unlike the bad.”</p>
<p>The Rebbe used to quote Rebbe Shmuel, the fifth Lubavitcher rebbe, who urged people to jump a hurdle rather than go under it – to go the harder way.</p>
<p>Even when the Rebbe’s advice was followed, things still did not always work out well. That can happen. With so many questions and answers involved, it is likely that some of the outcomes will be unsatisfactory no matter how obedient the participants. That the Rebbe’s advice might fail certainly did not seem to deter any of his Chasidim, just as it does not deter people who go to a doctor for medical advice. However, a rigorous assessment of the Rebbe’s advice is beyond my capability.<br />
We often wondered what was the source of his advice – besides his experience. His answers often depended on common sense or obvious vast knowledge, but from time to time his answers were inexplicable and seemed to be drawn from another wellspring. A partial answer may be that he served as a channel – sometimes consciously, sometimes not – of the world beyond our daily reality, touching on the transcendent.</p>
<p>[Reform rabbi from South Orange, NJ] Rabbi Herbert Weiner once told me that he asked the Rebbe, “How is it that you can give advice?” The Rebbe answered, “People come to me and complain that the gate is locked and the way is closed before them. They do not know that they carry the key with them. All I have to do is to turn the key in the lock and open the closed door.”</p></blockquote>
<p>An important part of the Rebbe’s teachings was his acceptance of many aspects of the 1950’s emphasis on Americanism and democracy as well as his acceptance of civil society and even civil religion.  His writings defend equality and more striking Steinsaltz says he supported American law. Compare this to his current followers who has endless appeals,  litigation and cries of Anti-Semitism to defend their severe crimes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Rebbe believed that governments’ monies should be spent on quality of life and not on weapons of war. The injustice of the income disparity – the great gap between rich and poor – was not an unfortunate economic byproduct but a universal issue.</p>
<p>The Rebbe referred to the United States as a malchut shel chesed, a “benevolent society.” It is true that the Rebbe was grateful to the country that had saved the life of his family. Beyond the personal, however, the Rebbe saw the country as a force of good in the world. While he did not approve of every aspect of American life and government policy, he always spoke about the nation with deep appreciation. The Rebbe valued the legal and civil fairness of the United States, the equal opportunity to all its citizens, and the equality that Jews enjoy under the law.</p>
<p>For the Rebbe, America was a nation of great moral character, characterized by a strong religious bent. Since America treats all its citizens with decency and equality, the Rebbe emphasized that every Jew is bound by Jewish law to uphold the laws of the land – and not to subvert, let alone break them. For this reason he refused to protect his Chasidim or others who had been caught breaking American laws.</p>
<p>The Rebbe also saw the United States as a true supporter of Jews and the Jewish state. More than once, he commented that the source of problems in America’s relationship with the State of Israel lay in Israeli errors in judgment: Israeli political leaders often misjudge the strength of American support.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is an interesting section. In the Freidman/Heilman work they speculated that the young Rabbi Schneerson was a man who “must be feeling desperate in his anxiety, loneliness, confusion and survivor guilt, whose prospects are unclear, looking for a way out, an answer from God.” Here we have that isolated hypothetical passage turned into a theory of the Rebbe as the <em>Lonely Man of Faith.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The Rebbe’s loneliness was perhaps inevitable. Those who had once been his peers, workmates and colleagues became his subordinates and Chasidim. Although their relationships continued, these were no longer ordinary friendships. Having assumed the responsibility of solving his Chasidim’s personal problems, he could no longer talk to them as an equal. This created an existential choice for loneliness, which might even be termed “aloneness.” From his deep relationship with his family, we know he had the capacity of intimacy with others. Yet, in the official role that consumed his life, it could not be expressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>What about the stories of supernatural precognition? Steinsaltz does not give us lots of colorful stories of people coming to the Rebbe and him saving them against all odds. Rather, we get a universal call to the possibility of Enlightenment and prophecy within all of us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Those with the gift of ruach hakodesh describe it as a kind of sight-seeing, perceiving or experiencing things that are physically or tempo¬rarily at a distance. In the nineteenth century, the second and the third rebbes of the Komarno dynasty described their experiences of ruach hakodesh in the book, The Scroll of Secrets. Both state that they had this ability since a very young age. Given only someone’s name, the Kom¬arno rebbes could provide a full physical description of a person whom they had never met.</p>
<p>A college student once had the temerity to ask the Rebbe if he had supernatural powers. The Rebbe answered that these powers are within the grasp of every Jew. The ability to control nature and to rise above it comes from a devout and complete adherence to God’s will, from the observance of mitzvot and the study of Torah. Each of us can rise above our situation. The question before us, the Rebbe continued, is whether we have the determination and the commitment to reach our potential.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, what about the messianism? Steinsaltz portrays the Rebbe as concerned with the topic since his youth,  that he did not see himself as the mashiach, and that his followers are now adrift and forlorn.</p>
<blockquote><p>From childhood, the Rebbe had dreams about the coming of the Mashiach. In a letter to Israel’s second president, Yitchak Ben-Zvi, the Rebbe wrote: “From the day I went to cheder [religious primary school] and even before, the picture of the final redemption started forming in my mind – the redemption of the Jews from their last exile, a redemption in such a way that through it will be understood the sufferings of exile, the decrees and the destruction….”</p>
<p>At a 1991 farbrengen, just a few months before his first stroke, some of the Chasidim began a song which clearly named the Rebbe as Mashiach. The Rebbe stopped them quickly and said, “I cannot leave here now, but after hearing such a claim I should leave this room as a protest.”</p>
<p>We may think of the famous Walt Whitman poem about Abraham Lincoln: “O Captain, My Captain.” But for Chabad the situation has been more perilous; the Rebbe’s ship has not reached port. It has not come to rest at the end of its intended course. While in the middle of the sea, it lost its captain.</p></blockquote>

				<p>The year was 1986, Rabbi Binyamin Walfish was head of the RCA and former head of the RCA Rabbi Gilbert Klapperman was head of the Synagogue Council of America (including Reform, Orthodox and Conservative rabbis). The issue which was to occupy them for several years was the lack of a successor for Rav Soloveitchik and no potential prospects. Three months after this conference they created a law committee but left the chronically infirm Rav Solvoeitchik as its head. The following year&#8217;s conference in 1987 was a debate about what Rav Soloveitchik had meant in various decrees and a bemoaning of not having anyone to resolve issues anymore. Artscroll bothered them a lot. I include the entire article as read by OCR software. (Photos are both Rabbi Walfish)  </p>
<p><strong>RCA struggles to carve out centrist Orthodox stand – Long Island Jewish World Feb 14-20, 1986</strong>-Larry Yudelson</p>
<p>Even as participants in the Rabbincal Council of America&#8217;s midwinter conference struggled with the question of dialogue with non-Orthodox colleagues off to the left. they were looking regularly over their shoulders towards the Orthodox right. Indeed, much of the conference shaped up as a forum for defining and staking out a position of &#8220;centrist Orthodoxy&#8221; by the RCA in the face of the apparent ascendancy of Orthodox fundamentalism.</p>
<p>Whether the RCA can work with the non-Orthodox on questions of basic Jewish identity depends on whether it can resist pressures against such contact from the right.</p>

<p>Several speakers at the conference attacked rightwing Orthodoxy, but despite the rhetoric, many members of the RCA acknowledged the Orthodox right&#8217;s influence.</p>
<p>The distinctive tenets of the RCA were implicit in the conference theme of <strong>&#8220;Initiative and Innovations Within the Parameter of Halacha&#8221;</strong>: a rejection of the 19th century Orthodox maxim that &#8220;anything new is prohibited by the Torah,&#8221; and a firm acceptance that any charge must take place within, and not against, the framework of halacha. </p>
<p>Rabbi Tobias Roth, from Long Branch, N.J.. distinguished centrist Orthodoxy from Reform and Conservative. who &#8216; legislate without halacha&#8221; and<strong> from right- wing Orthodoxy which, he said, made political and social issues such as siting on a board of rabbis with non-Orthodox rabbis, into matters of halacha.</strong> <strong>He decried the right wing &#8220;tendency for fundamentalism, which is encouraging the separation of the observant and the non-observant,</strong>&#8221;&#8221;Even within Orthodoxy,&#8221; he  continued, &#8220;the only bridges are unidirectional, leading to stringency in observance.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Centrism No Compromise </strong><br />
Rabbi Reuven Bulka of Ottawa, Ontario called for the RCA to &#8220;become much more aggressive in the ideology it espouses.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The middle of the road should not be looked at as a compromise,&#8217; he said</p>
<p>He took the right-wing to task for what he charged was its growing distancing from the State of Israel He asked why the modern Orthodox tolerate statements from Orthodox circles that &#8220;we&#8217;re not anti-Israel we&#8217;re just against the Israeli government,&#8221; when claims from anti-Semites that they&#8217;re &#8220;just anti-Zionist&#8221; are rightly protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve capitulated on our own domain,&#8221; he said, noting that a yeshiva shows religiosity by not doing anything on Yom Haatzmaut (Israeli Independence Day).</p>
<p>&#8220;Any ideology that doesn&#8217;t recognize the State of Israel should be fought very aggressively,&#8221; he said. Bulka cited the popular ArtScroll series of Jewish books as an example where the right&#8217;s approach is tolerated. The new ArtScroll siddur, he said, omits the prayer for the State of Israel; a translation of an Israeli halachic work eliminates references to the religious Zionist leader Rabbi Abraham Kook; and Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, the RCA&#8217;s halachic authority, is never quoted in their anthologies of Bible commentaries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying we should boycott ArtScroll,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we should say, we represent the Torah community too. What right do they have to say that the ideology of the RCA has to be excluded from the realm of legitimate interpretation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He criticized what he called &#8220;terror tactics&#8221; that are used to decide matters of halacha. &#8220;Great luminaries, halachic masters, are threatened and cajoled by the yeshiva world. It ends up distorting the halachic process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bulka further attacked the right for its parochial reaction to events in Israel.<br />
&#8220;When tragedy involves someone from the religious segment of the community, immediately there are prayers in yeshivas and public outcries. But if it&#8217;s someone non-observant, there&#8217;s a strange silence whim the religious community,&#8221; he charged.</p>
<p><strong>Roshei Yeshiva Too influential </strong><br />
<strong>Rabbi Yossi Adler of Teaneck, called on the centrist Orthodox to win back the educated Orthodox community from the roshei yeshiva or yeshiva heads, who, he said, indoctrinate their students not to respect synagogue rabbis.</p>
<p>He asked why the RCA held the conference isolated in the Catskills. saying the public should know that innovative changes can be made within the parameters of halacha.</strong></p>
<p>[Rabbi Jacob] Rubinstein echoed that view, decrying the &#8220;myopic&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; view that there are no so such things as innovation in halacha.</p>
<p>In an interview after the conference, Rabbi Binyamin Walfish, executive vice president of the RCA, said that <strong>&#8220;a major problem in Jewish life today is that roshei yeshiva have become poskim (decisors of halacha).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>In the European communities, he said, the community rabbi decided halacha. Roshei yeshiva, he said, don&#8217;t have a good perspective on the problems of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t ask your rebbe questions on the laws of kashrut or Shabbat,&#8221; Walfish said. <strong>But he distinguished between relying on a teacher for the fine points of halacha arid for answering sociopolitical questions &#8220;where halacha is not involved.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>According to Walfish, <strong>&#8220;the younger element (of the RCA) is more dependent on the roshei yeshiva.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Orthodox Stringency</strong><br />
In his session on &#8220;Halacha Confronts a Changing Society.&#8221; Rabbi David Berger, a professor of Jewish History at City University of New York, discussed a change in the direction of halachic decisions in the modern period when the Jewish People divided between observant and nonobservant Jews</p>
<p>One reaction, he said, was greater strictness. The rabbis feared that if they gave the increasingly rebellious community a finger, they would take a hand.</p>
<p>And ironically, he said, the pressure for leniency decreased as those pressing for leniency split off from Orthodoxy. No longer would ordinary people, burdened by a halachic decision. return to the rabbi h hi in pain. They would just walk away from the Orthodox community.</p>
<p>Because of the voluntary nature of Jewish observance in the modern era, those who cared about halacha cared strongly enough to accept stringent opinions, said Berger. Even when Reform Jews were right in the technical halachic sense, he said, some Orthodox rabbis argued for inflexibility as a matter of public policy.</p>
<p><strong>Today, the question of women&#8217;s prayer groups, he said, in a certain sense falls into this category. The condemnation is &#8220;a public policy decision based on a judgment of the consequences of this particular step.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s explicit in the discussion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s couched in halachic, or quasi-halachic terminology, but it&#8217;s really a public policy issue.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Someone who  reacts positively towards the religious complaints of Jewish feminists is more likely to be lenient,&#8221; he said.</strong></p>

				<p>Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, the Senior Rabbi of KJ reflected on the article written by his congregant on social Orthodoxy. (Everything below is his words and the sermon is complete w/o editing.)</p>
<p>This past Shabbat morning, I delivered a sermon entitled The Rise of &#8216;Social Orthodoxy:&#8217;  Is it Good or Bad for the Jews?  The sermon responded to a recently published article in Commentary by KJ Member Jay Lefkowitz, entitled The Rise of Social Orthodoxy:  A Personal Account&#8230;  Jay&#8217;s article elicited a great deal of interest and some criticism.  I devoted my sermon to the article, to some unjustified criticism which came to my attention, and to my own reactions to Jay&#8217;s excellently researched and analytic description of a very important phenomenon in Orthodox Jewish life.<br />

<p>The Rise of &#8216;Social Orthodoxy:&#8217;  Is it Good or Bad for the Jews?<br />
Rabbi Haskel Lookstein<br />
Parashat Kedoshim<br />
April 26, 2014</p>
<p>The Jewish community, and particularly the Orthodox Jewish community, owes a debt of gratitude to our member, Jay Lefkowitz, for opening a conversation on a phenomenon that has existed for quite some time and that is growing in numbers and influence in America and, perhaps, in Israel as well.  Jay calls it &#8220;Social Orthodoxy.&#8221;  It could be described as &#8220;cultural Orthodoxy&#8221; or &#8220;communal Orthodoxy.&#8221;  He describes a committed Jewish life that doesn&#8217;t rely on God or a divinely authored, authoritative Halakha for inspiration or obligation.  No one is being obligated to do anything.  Social Orthodox Jews are developing what might be described as a voluntary commitment to behave in a religious way as a manifestation of their commitment to the Jewish people, to a 4,000 year old history, to Zionism, and to Jewish culture.  All of this is expressed through serious, religious practice including Shabbat, Yom Tov, prayer, tefillin, kashrut and other forms of observance.  As he writes: &#8220;And so for me, and I imagine for many others like me, the key to Jewish living is not our religious beliefs but our commitment to a set of practices and values that foster community and continuity.  This way of life makes the social Orthodox Jew part of the Jewish people and the sweep of Jewish history in a very powerful and fulfilling way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jay freely admits in this article that he &#8211; and, no doubt, many other social Orthodox Jews &#8211; who act like religious people, who speak like religious people and who look like religious people, do not really relate to God or to the divine authority that lies behind a life of mitzvot.  </p>
<p>He graphically describes this phenomenon in a conversation about religion which he had with a devout Catholic friend as a young adult.  He writes: &#8220;When I explained (to my friend) that I was an observant Jew and began each day by reciting the morning prayers, but wasn&#8217;t really sure how God fit into my life, he was perplexed.  When I admitted that these theological questions didn&#8217;t really occupy much of my attention and certainly weren&#8217;t particularly germane to my life as an observant Jew, he became agitated. And when I told him that I certainly wasn&#8217;t sure if Jewish law was divine or simply the result of two millennia of rabbinical interpretations, he threw up his hands and said: &#8216;How can you do everything you do, and live a life with so many restrictions and so many obligations, if you don&#8217;t even believe in God?'&#8221;</p>
<p>When I read this exchange I had a déjà vu experience.  It was about sixty years ago that I had an extended debate with Jay&#8217;s father, my tennis opponent of almost seventy years (we have played about 500 sets over these years and Jerry Lefkowitz is narrowly ahead of me by something like 251 to 249).  </p>
<p>The debate took place in my parents&#8217; living room on a Shabbat afternoon.  Jerry was explaining exactly the kind of life that his son and daughter-in-law and their children live today, a life to which he subscribed: observant, deeply engaged in Jewish culture and Zionism, committed to Hebrew literacy, but without a firm belief in God or Halakha.  </p>
<p>I remember saying to him that I couldn&#8217;t understand why he accepted upon himself so many restrictions and rules if there was no divine authority behind them.  I said that if I didn&#8217;t believe in God and a divinely based Halakha,  then I would go inside to my bedroom in the middle of Shabbat and take out my pack of cigarettes and light up a cigarette.  Why should I deprive myself of such pleasure if there are really no compelling rules about Shabbat?  Jerry&#8217;s answer was that he keeps Shabbat because that&#8217;s part of being a Jew and uniting with Jewish culture and history over thousands of years.  I found that position perplexing.</p>
<p>I have to admit that over the years I have come to feel that Jerry and his wife, Myrna, had a point.  Part of the proof of the validity of that point is their children and grandchildren, specifically, Jay and Elena and their three children and the life that they lead.</p>
<p>So, clearly, what Jay describes as Social Orthodoxy is good for the Jews.  It keeps many Jews together and on the derech, so to speak.  </p>
<p>But I am still troubled by some of the concerns that I had sixty years ago.  Those concerns were highlighted in an analysis of the Haggadah by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, which he published recently in YU&#8217;s publication &#8220;Passover to Go.&#8221;  Focusing on the question of the rasha &#8211; the skeptic son &#8211; in the Haggadah, &#8220;What is this avoda,&#8221;  Rabbi Sacks identified the question of the skeptic son as the Talmud Yerushalmi explains it, when it translates the word avoda as tircha &#8211; hard work or bother.  The Talmud says that the rasha is asking a question about the Passover sacrifice.  Why all this bother and effort?  Why this plethora of rules about a festival sacrifice?  The Ritva (a medieval commentator who never experienced the Passover sacrifice) focuses on the seder itself and suggests that the rasha is asking: &#8220;Why is it necessary to go through this whole tedious Haggadah before getting to the meal?  Why can&#8217;t we just sit down and eat?  Why go through the whole effort of telling the story in so many ways about the exodus from Egypt and the progress of the Jewish people from idol worshipping to the service of one God?  Let&#8217;s just eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>In truth, as Rabbi Sacks suggests, Judaism does require tremendous effort.  It is a system of detailed attention to religious practice in Shabbat, kashrut, nidah and mikveh and a myriad of other responsibilities.  Who needs all this, asks the rasha!</p>
<p>In fact, Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist  leaders tried to keep Jews close to Judaism by easing the requirements and giving Jews the opportunity to be less restricted and restrained in Shabbat, kashrut, taharat hamishpacha and other ritual performances.  What happened was that, rather than keeping Jews closer to tradition, the lessening of demands led Jews to move further and further away from Judaism, the opposite of what was the intention of the leaders.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, what are the holidays that non-Orthodox Jews celebrate in the largest numbers?  They are the holidays that require the biggest effort: fasting on Yom Kippur and celebrating the seder and Pesach.  Apparently, Rabbi Saks suggest, Jews find meaning in the effort which the rasha rejects.  This should not be surprising.  Anything worthwhile is achieved through effort and struggle:  becoming an artist, a musician, a scholar, a doctor, lawyer or financier.  Why should religion not require tircha &#8211; effort?</p>
<p>The real question that Jay raises for the Orthodox Jew is the question of sustainability.  Can Social Orthodoxy actually produce generations of committed Jews?  How is Jewish history, Jewish culture and commitment to Jewish people-hood going to demand of me and my descendants the kind of avoda &#8211; effort and consistency &#8211; that is required of a committed Jew?  Doesn&#8217;t such effort and consistency rest on a foundation of God, a divinely authored Halakha and, therefore, a required set of observances, not just a reasoned, voluntary performance of rituals?  If it is the latter, why not allow driving to shul on Shabbat; why does one need a blech on the stove for Shabbat?   Can&#8217;t one have a meaningful Shabbat without a blech?  And why require a mechitza during worship?  Can&#8217;t one have an inspirational davening without separating men from women?</p>
<p>These are serious questions which are not easily answered by reason and logic and a desire to be part of the Jewish people and 4,000 years of Jewish history.  The Orthodox or Halakhic Jew &#8211; answers them by saying:  all of these are required by Jewish law.  They may or may not enhance our religious experience, but they are obligations which are part of the Halakhic system to which we subscribe.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t that we fear a thunderbolt hurled by God at us if we fail to perform a mitzvah or if we commit a sin.  But there is something compelling about a life of Torah and mitzvot when one feels that such a life is based upon a divinely ordained system.</p>
<p>Many of today&#8217;s Social Orthodox Jews have sustained their commitment beyond a first generation.  Jay and Elena Lefkowitz and their children are a case in point.  They lead a highly committed Jewish life in our community, impelled by deeply ingrained cultural, historical and social forces.  And yet: will those forces, divorced from a divine, Halakhic imperative, have a lasting power for the Orthodox community as a whole?  Will the children and grandchildren of today&#8217;s Social Orthodox be able to answer the Haggadah&#8217;s question:  Why exert all this effort and all this expense and this whole avoda and undertake this detailed, comprehensive and demanding way of life?</p>
<p> That troubling question remains.  On the answer to it depends the survival and sustainability of a sanctified Jewish way of life, a life in which Jay Lefkowitz and all of us so passionately believe.</p>

				<p>I was looking for an article about early 20th century Orthodoxy and in the process I found the following article on Jewish Hobos. I have especially selected the paragraphs that deal with religious life and Orthodox hobos.  The article was written in 1928 and the problem of homeless vagabonds got worse in the 1930’s. Does anyone still remember Red Skelton&#8217;s character Freddie the Freeloader? Many rabbinical sermons of the 1950’s exhorted the congregation by claiming that a Jewish way of life prevents one from becoming a hobo or Bowery bum. As late as the 1970’s Jewish English still had the phrase trombernick as for someone vagabond, undisciplined or even for a hippie.  Notice how the homeless think they can judge a community’s customs or have a self-perception as defenders of the faith.  Also notice the tone of the author, which would not be accepted in social science today.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;TROMBENICKS &#8221; OR JEWISH HOBOES, RALPH ASTROFSKY</strong></p>
<p>Cities with old orthodox constituencies like Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, attract religious itinerant mendicants in the practice of making regular week-end visits. They attend the synagogues to pray for departed souls at so much a prayer, deliver lectures (droshes) and pass judgment on differences concerning various religious customs and observances. In return they are invited by the members of the synagogue to their homes for the Friday evening meal or to dinner following the Saturday morning services. Some of the religious travelers possess vast knowledge in their specific field and an excellent oratorical delivery, but many of them are rabbis who are ignorant of the Law, melamdim (teachers) who know nothing about pedagogy, and chazanim (cantors) who cannot sing. </p>
<p>They consider themselves entitled to reduced transportation rates and an unqualified welcome by the local hachnosas orchim, and usually do receive special attention. They generally shun the offices of case working agencies and prefer contributions from private individuals, benevolent aid societies made up of members from their home towns, and friendly orthodox synagogues in the poor sections of the city. In their journeys to small communities they occasionally do strike desirable jobs and settle down, but such examples are rare, indeed. </p>
<p>To meet the above situation Dr. Bogen has suggested  that &#8220;a better organization of our synagogues, an absolute refusal to permit the traveler the use of the pulpit unless by previous engagement through a central agency, are possible ways to reduce the number who are dependent upon charity. Then the situation will be easily controlled and the traveling chazan will be considered just as legitimate a proposition.</p>
<p>They will search telephone books for a &#8220;noch&#8221; (hachnosas orchim), a Jewish shelter for transients, or a &#8220;pay station&#8221; (a social agency or central almsgiving society). If there is no established &#8220;pay station&#8221; in town, he feels at liberty to work &#8220;factories&#8221; (synagogues where collections might be made), store keepers whose names end in &#8220;stein,&#8221; &#8220;baum&#8221; or &#8220;berg,&#8221; and, of course, junk dealers of any nationality, a never failing source.</p>
<p>No wonder the Jewish hobo prefers the &#8220;noch&#8221; with its simple precept not to make oneself too well known to the janitor or caretaker. Wise old beggars have sometimes manipulated a two- and even three month extension of time at a hachnosas orchim, a feat quite impossible at a publicly maintained lodging house. &#8220;You know how it is,&#8221; explained one experienced schnorrer,&#8221;with Yiddin you can always come to terms.&#8221; Another young hobo, an habitué of the Bowery, lacking &#8220;two bits&#8221; (25c) for a &#8220;flop,&#8221;refused to associate with the&#8221;goyim&#8221; and bums at the city shelter and requested permission to stayat the hachnosas orchim, pronouncing that difficult name flawlessly, though unable to utter another Hebrew word. There are &#8220;nochs&#8221; famous throughout Jewish hobohemia for their abundant fare on the High Holidays, particularly on Passover.</p>
<p>Your Gentile hobo loses hope, fills his stomach with rotten liquor at every opportunity, and shoots needles into his arms to relieve his aching heart. The Jewish tramp will take refuge in metaphysics or &#8220;riddles,&#8221; as he calls it, break up a game of dice to which he is not adapted, and start a poker game instead. </p>
<p>Sex perversion is generally frowned upon by Jewish hoboes, although they freely indulge their normal desires in the cheapest brothels where they never once fail to admonish an inhabitant of their own faith for her disgraceful profession. </p>
<p>At one such party I caught notice of a &#8220;trombenick&#8221; clandestinely tugging carrots from his pockets, unwilling to participate in the prize dish because it was not  kosher, as he declared to me later<br />
Many a young fellow has been hounded out of home for his laziness or queerness. There may be a marriageable daughter at home, or a son about to enter an honorable profession, when it becomes essential to sacrifice the pariah to the road rather than jeopardize the social ambitions of the other members of the family. </p>
<p>Many a runaway lad will discover the Bowery, that Alsatian den of misery and despair. Only recently a boy of fifteen who had refused to &#8220;leigen t&#8217;filin,&#8221; told me how he had lived on the Bowery during his entire absence from home and associated with the human riff-raff who make that street their winter headquarters. </p>
<p>One pitiful old vagabond called himself the &#8220;Defender of the Jewish Faith,&#8221; and so offensive were his letters to public men that he was finally held for observation and sent to a state institution. </p>
<p>Close observation of the homeless, their examination by competent psychiatrists, have indicated that a large number of them are either mentally unbalanced or of defective intelligence.</p>
<p>The writer fervently hopes that his interest in this human debris will  be retained at least until the time when opportunity will enable him to make a national comprehensive study to disclose more fully their character and needs, shedding light on the possible diminution of their number.<br />

				<p>In my current pursuit of all knowledgeable Jewish reflections on Hinduism, I went searching for contact information for Rabbi Dr. Alan Unterman who years ago had written on the interface of the two faiths.

Yael can be contacted, and her books ordered, <a href="http://www.yaelunterman.com">through her website </a></p>
<p>The first eight questions of the interview are on her new book and in the last few questions I made her return to her earlier book on Nehama Leibowitz.</p>
<p>1)	<strong>Why is your book called The Hidden of Things?</strong><br />
I am quite obsessed with what is hidden and what is revealed in our lives. This is true for the interpersonal level, in terms of interactions and dress, and for the media, in terms of revealing of secrets and lack of boundaries. </p>
<p>Today’s cultural climate does not reward modesty and reticence, with all the talk shows and candid memoirs and therapeutic language that pervade the air;  but on the other hand, the professed values of traditional Jewish society can fall too far along the other extreme, leaving too much unsaid, sometimes to terrible effect. </p>
<p>I am prone to chronically wondering to what extent God is revealed to us today, is there ongoing revelation in every moment, and if so how can we make ourselves sensitive to receiving the divine, or is it all concealed within the tzimtzum through which we were created? </p>
<p>The act of writing a book reveals things ordinarily hidden from view – the nuances of characters’ private feelings and motivations. Writing such as this can resonate with the hidden inner parts of the readers, who might have previously believed themselves completely alone in certain thoughts or feelings that you, the author, have now articulated – and that’s liberating.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Why do you call yourself &#8220;unorthodox orthodox&#8221;? </strong><br />
It implies that freethinking and individualism is allowed, even within Orthodoxy. Generally the label “modern orthodox” does not seem to sufficiently cover who I am, so I like to add something to it to spice it up – calling myself, for example, “Neo-Hasidic postmodern Orthodox” or “Paradox” (the latter slightly tongue-in-cheek!). </p>
<p>People seem to need labels, which can be helpful when trying to ascertain the existence of common assumptions; and the fact remains that I have held onto the label “Orthodox”, while some friends of mine have jettisoned it altogether. Nevertheless such brandings also divide, constrain and mislead. I live in that tension, between embracing and rejecting labels. I have even called myself “Post-denominational Orthodox”, which is nonsense logically, but expresses how I feel. </p>
<p>3) <strong>What is the role of Orthodoxy and social criticism of the Orthodox in your writings?</strong><br />
I write about Jewish and universal topics, aiming at a wide range of readers. But my characters do tend to belong to the modern Orthodox world; for it is there that the most interesting creative tensions and clashes occur, leading to inner drama, angst and growth, the materials that spawn my writing. </p>
<p>As to the social criticism – to my mind, the best critics are those who are deeply in love with a system and yet don’t relinquish their critical minds. I reject one-dimensional writing about religious life, preferring to present a range of people whose attitude towards religion diverge and who are more nuanced and individual. </p>
<p>I am interested in books that present faith struggles in an intelligent fashion (e.g. The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell, a convert to Judaism –  a book that had a profound effect on my theological outlook). I’m bored by criticism of Orthodoxy from outsiders or from bitter former insiders; Orthodoxy easily lends itself to being a punching bag and target of ridicule if one wishes to, you don’t have to be clever to do that. My hope is that my critical voice might be used as a springboard for positive change from within. And that my love for traditional Judaism comes through in equal measure.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Who are your models in general literature or in contemporary Orthodox literature?</strong><br />
I learned a lot about the short story form from the materials presented during my MA in Creative Writing at Bar Ilan University – authors such as Babel, Mansfield, Gogol and Joyce. I also admire excellent science fiction writers such as Ursula Le Guin, Orson Scott Card, and the aforementioned Mary Doria Russell. </p>
<p>In terms of good Orthodox literature (a small, through growing, category) I find Potok compelling, and I like to read my contemporaries Tova Mirvis and Ruchama King Feuerman, as well as Naomi Regan and other lesser-known Orthodox writers (such as Rabbi Shlomo Wexler who authored The Daughters Victorious, on the Bnot Zelophchad story).  In general I believe and hope that Orthodox writing, if we can get past certain moralistic tendencies and a lot of bad writing in the community, will develop to a more sophisticated, imaginative, daring mode. </p>
<p>5) <strong>What should we be reading in Orthodox literature right now?</strong><br />
Ruchama King Feuerman’s In the Courtyard of the Kabbalist was nominated finalist in the 2014 National Jewish Book  Awards (I am doing a joint book event with her– see above for details). There are many new authors, most of whom I have not yet had a chance to read, and this is an exciting time of emergence for this population.</p>
<p>In Hebrew, I highly recommend Emunah Elon’s novel Bemuflah Mimeni, a delicate, moving modern version of the Resh Lakish and Rabbi Yohanan story, with a Sliding Doors theme. Additionally, Michael Schonfeld has written Hahok Lemeniyat Habedidut, overlapping with some of my themes around singles and loneliness.<br />
My story “Dateline Manhattan 2029” presents a dystopian future in which the gedolim enact a series of rules in the 600-page volume Ozer Dalim to address the so-called “shidduch crisis”, including mandatory parties, dating coaches, singles ghettoes and more. Intriguingly enough, Schonfeld presents a similar idea, whereby in Israel of 2020, the Knesset is considering passing laws penalizing singles. </p>
<p>6)<strong> Does your book fall into the chick-lit genre?</strong><br />
There is a resemblance, but I wouldn’t use that category per se for my book overall; despite much humour and light-heartedness, it’s ultimately darker and more layered and symbolic writing than this genre allows. </p>
<p>I do engage with issues concerning modern womanhood: relationships, emotions, self-image, etc; and my female characters support each other through traumas such as broken relationships, the Intifada and the challenges faced by English-speaking immigrants to Israel. Yet the themes of spiritual search and longing are also present for men, and my stories featuring male protagonists. I’m even rejecting to a large degree the prerequisite chick lit/Hollywood happy ending – the neat conclusions (engagements/ marriages) I included were actually at my publisher’s insistence, and they come in the form of a play, such that my characters are a bit like puppets. Still, we Jews do believe in happy endings (see Kohelet and Iyov) so I am glad they are there to give hope and joy.</p>
<p>7) <strong>More than one rabbi has proposed that Orthodox writers should submit their work to them for an halakhic OK. How would you respond?</strong><br />
My gut reaction is a no – I prefer self-censorship and would hate for this to become another area where a kashrut symbol is necessary. Having said that, kashrut in its best sense is a service to the consumer to inform about standards and indicate what is inside, like movie ratings. Book ratings by an objective body might not be such a bad thing. </p>
<p>I did have one haredi reader who objected to the language employed by some of my characters, remaining unmoved by my argument that manner of speech was true to the characters, or my defense of my integrity as a writer (I offered to refund her money&#8230;) Had there been a rating system, my book would likely have gotten a PG, (not a G or U) and then she would have known in advance not to buy it.</p>
<p>8 )<strong> How is the writing  of literature for you an expression of your religious life? </strong><br />
In a course at Bar-Ilan University with Professor Susan Handelman entitled “Religion and Literature”, I discovered that literature carries a great deal of spirituality, where spirituality implies connection with self, others and God.<br />
As an author, you hold your readers in your hands for a significant number of hours, often consecutively – something few rabbis can boast. You get to choose where to take the reader: the illuminative moment, the high drama, the laughter, the tears, the surprise twist. A good writer’s voice enters the reader’s head and lingers there even once the book is closed.</p>
<p>So I feel that through my book I can provide relaxation and pleasure – badly needed in today’s hectic world – and oneg Shabbat, in the words of more than one reader. I can also aspire to teach Torah in vivid ways; to exercise the reader’s faculty of empathy for unfortunate others, or make those who are the unfortunate ones feel validated and less alone; and even to awaken the yearning for G-d. Personally when I finish a good book, I sigh and feel that the world is a wonderful place and I am in love with G-d’s creation. Hopefully some of my readers will feel the same. </p>
<p>9) <strong>How did you come to write your first book Nehama Leibowitz: Teacher and Bible Scholar (Urim, 2009 – National Jewish Book Award finalist)?</strong><br />
In 1998, Tzvi Mauer of Urim Publications envisioned printing Modern Jewish Lives, a series of biographies of great Orthodox personalities whose open and un-stereotypical nature meant that the more right-wing Orthodox printing houses would not touch them with a ten-foot pole. I was privileged to be commissioned, though young and inexperienced, to write the book intended to launch this series  (I say ‘intended’ because the project took ten years instead of the projected two – a combination of Nehama Leibowitz’s multi-faceted nature and long life, and my perfectionism – and it ended up third in the series instead of first). </p>
<p>The act of documenting someone else’s work, though, is one requiring tremendous amounts of self-effacement, which is a trait I aspire to but in which I do not naturally excel. By the end it was somewhat draining I was very ready to put it behind me and turn to the words, ideas and characters that were bursting to be born from my own mind..  </p>
<p>10) <strong>What do you admire most and not-admire about Nehama Leibowitz? </strong><br />
Despite all of her talents, erudition and fame, Nehama remained a very warm, caring, genuine, unpretentious and modest person who spoke her truth and kept to her moral standards. She innovated without trumpeting it about, and was dedicated to Torah. She was a mensch, nurturing others, but also courageous and true to herself – for example, she married her uncle when she was just 25 and he 54 years of age. She did this against the wishes of everyone around her, including her family. </p>
<p>Nehama’s teaching style was quite forceful and rigid in many ways, and I don’t think she was able to truly hear everything her students wished to bring into the class, if it did not fall within her perspective. Indeed, I don’t believe Nehama would have understood the kinds of issues I want to raise, had I been her student. I see myself as a person with 21st century consciousness, while Nehama was a person of her time, of the 20th century, and would have been unwilling or unable to follow me to the places I wished to go. This saddens me, both personally and also in terms of the limitations it places on her work. </p>
<p>She also did not change very much throughout her life, teaching the same Torah throughout, while I am a person of change. And lastly, she tended to reject religious experience in favor of doing mitzvot as the fundamental of Jewish living. A rationalist, most likely influenced by her family – father, husband and brother – she did not incorporate Hasidic or kabbalistic teachings, aside from the rare piece of Zohar, in her work. For me, these two corpuses carry traditional Judaism into the postmodern age,  and resonate deeply. Hence, their absence is a lacuna, though Nehama’s passion and poetry do a lot to make up for it.</p>
<p>I guess, if I am to answer honestly, my greatest fear is that despite my own love of teaching Torah and making it vivid, Nehama would not have understood or approved of me. I would not have met her high standards and my existential questions would have been classified as unnecessary navel-gazing, an act she  did very little of. This, along with her shutting the door on biblical criticism, freed up lots of energy for bringing people to love Torah. </p>
<p>Questioning and doubt sometimes seem to me like spilling precious energy on the ground, Onan style. Yet I cannot help my existential bent. Ultimately I am different from her and have to be authentic to myself. My second book, and any meaning and pleasure it gives to people, would not have been written by Nehama Leibowitz. We each have our unique path to take in life.</p>
<p>11)<strong> Can you say something about Nehama’s poetics?</strong><br />
For the most part, Nehama’s approach closely approximated the methodology of the New Critics, an approach to literature spearheaded by T.S. Eliot and others. They read the text closely, and were interested only in what was written and not in its historical background. </p>
<p>Nehama’s goal was to counteract the habit of “reading the Bible like a madly galloping war-horse,” to force the reader to slow down, pay attention to nuance, structure, layers, word order, tone and rhythm. For her, one small detail might contain an entire philosophy or a crucial moral point. No repetition was redundant – indeed, a favorite tool of hers was to undertake thorough comparisons of two texts that appear to overlap, checking similarities and differences. The literary context was also all-important for this type of reading. </p>
<p>Nehama disliked biblical criticism, believing it to be with riddled with ignorance and anti-Semitism, and only quoted critical scholars on rare occasion. She was extreme in her rejection of realia, namely the archeological, anthropological, geographical, zoological, and botanical aspects of biblical research, and in this differed from – and argued vociferously with – some of her Orthodox colleagues in later years, most prominently Rabbi Yoel Bin Nun. Reportedly though, towards the end of her life she openly wondered if she had been too extreme in her stance. </p>

				<p>Back in 2004, when I received a call from a known rabbi in Har Nof asking about how the hair in Tirupati, India was offered, I never expected to be actually visiting a decade later the sacred mountain of Tirumala, near Tirupati. The Rabbi was unsuccessfully attempting to avert the expected panic that would ensue when the hair used in the wigs wore by Orthodox women was declared forbidden because of its  origin in a Hindu Temple. (For those unfamiliar with this unusual story see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/nyregion/14WIG.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.jta.org/2004/05/21/archive/ruling-on-idolatrous-wig-hair-creates-frenzy-in-orthodox-world">here</a>, and <a href="http://http/articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-09/news/0406090169_1_wigs-idol-worship-hair">here</a>) The rabbi’s questions were limited to whether it was similar to rabbinic conceptions of Greco-Roman sacrifice and the Rabbi  took the Talmud as a guide to contemporary Indian practice.  Visiting the actual mountaintop offers a broader vista on many levels. My observations are in the context of the wig controversy.</p>

<p>Tirumala is fittingly at the top of a mountain as it translates to literally a sacred hill or high place. About  three quarters of a mile up, one finds the the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and the nearest town in the valley is called Tirupati. It is the most visited pilgrimage place on earth, receiving more visitors a year than the Vatican or Mecca. To put it into numbers, the site receives about 156 million visitors a year averaging out to be about 60, 000 on an ordinary day and hundreds of thousands on a festival. Until recently, it was also the wealthiest religious institution, maintaining an annual budget of $167 million USD. The actual wealth is unknown but generally thought to be much greater than the Vatican’s.</p>
<p>During my stay in the city of a thousand temples, Kanchipuram, a town three and a half hours south of Tirumala, I observed a mini-celebration in the town center organized to noisily fete a group of male pilgrims who were beginning their four day walk to Tirumala.  While I did not walk with them, I was able to travel by car on well-paved back roads to reach the temple, which was about 138 km (86 mi) from my starting destination. </p>
<p>My local journey at a hotel in Tirupati (16 miles away) that offered check-in based on 24 hour units since the overwhelming majority of the guests people were flying in to visit the Temple for a few hours and then fly out.   How does one choose the hour in which one makes the holy pilgrimage for those who can pay the extra fees for immediate entry? The hotel had a full time horoscope prognostigtian and, on the telephone, a direct call button right next to the room service and concierge buttons. The roll of horoscopes in Indian culture is not given much attention in the West but it is ever-present and further makes me think that I am walking into Abraham ibn Ezra’s astrological world.</p>
<p>The ride up Tirumala Hill is straight up, 980 above sea level. The temple itself is located on a big plateau, about 10.33 square miles (27 km2) total in area. It comprises seven peaks and has a permanent population of 18 000. The road up has overlook points and breakdown areas and emergency crews ready on hand. </p>
<p>When you arrive at the top, you enter a several mile area of housing such as dormitories, motels, bungalows, and apartments, all structures reaching three stories. Also on the mountain top are playgrounds, concessions, a deer park, free medical clinics, and programs to help the deaf, blind, or handicapped. There is a shuttle bus taking pilgrims around the area. The mountaintop city is almost like  a large state college dormitory complex or fairgrounds or even 1970s detached buildings shopping mall, grey, utilitarian, and urban planned.  Below is an aerial view of the whole area<br />

<p>Also on the mountaintop is a ring of semi-decent looking hotels, more clinics, and more activities for kids. This outer-ring area also has a wonderful museum with an amazing collection, nicely curated showing artifacts from the history of the Temple mount, ancient religious objects, and Temple life. Imagine if Jerusalem had never been conquered and never lost anything to war and could therefore display 2500 years of artifacts. The long display case containing a millennium of musical instruments in another museum could have been an entire exhibition room.</p>
<p>On the other side of the circle is an Indian bazaar with wide avenues about five blocks by two blocks selling religious pictures and statues to take home, souvenir devotional objects, and pietistic chapbooks. They also sold children’s toys, especially big stuffed animals; there seems to be a custom to buy one for your children so that they enjoy the trip.  There are also food concessions ranging from restaurants to pushcarts. There are also pietistic performances, when I was there men were singing bhakti hymns in Telugu on a small bandstand. The college students making pilgrimage discovered the tackiest item being sold was a winter scarf that when wrapped around one’s head made one look like the halo bands on the Temple statue. Running down the center of the bazaar avenue is a sitting area covered by a high corrugated metal roof for sun and rain protection where people took naps or ate meals. </p>
<p>The next area on the mountain top was the holier Temple region, flanked on either end by the gopuram (the large tower that marks a south Indian Temple area) inside was a large campus sized fenced center that has that includes all the ancillary buildings to the Temple. This area is surrounded by the graded metal holding pens to be used on days of extreme visitation.<br />
Also included in this area is a large bakery of sweets with long lines dominated the first section. Each person who visits the Temple gets a token for two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laddu">sweet laddu </a>as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasad">prasadam </a>which has divine blessing from the deity and they can buy more at the bakery. </p>
<p>Then, there was a large block long holy water tank as found in most South Indian temples, partly a symbolic beauty of the pool, part a place to bath before visiting the Temple, and in this case a roped off area as a kiddie pool. Hindu purity law is similar to Karaite Jewish law and a pool of water is sufficient for purity.  It bordered onto a large open square with a stage for artistic performances at one end with a copy of the sacred statue inside  the Temple.</p>
<p>To the right was the rather modest, double story golden Temple, the goal of everyone’s pilgrimage the Sri Venkateswara temple, dedicated to the Lord Venkateswara Swamy (also called Sri Balaji). The temple is surrounded by metal lattice grating in several concentric circles creating a labyrinth holding pen for tens of thousands of visitors waiting the requisite 5-10 hours to get into the Temple. For those foreigners who want to enter, one must sign a form that one believes in the deity, they have also now insisted that one can only enter wearing traditional clothes of sari for women- dhoti and bare chest for men. Tamil scriptures say that one can only attain atonement at this Temple. (Tamil religion is more about grace, merit, atonement, and penance than the misplaced stylized Western discussions of Hinduism theology.) </p>
<p>For Hindus, this has become the abode of God, the place where one can directly see the divine, the closest most will ever get to a religious epiphany of the true Supreme Being. Originally, the Temple was a Tamil holy site to Venkateswara, identified by the important 11th century religious theologian Ramanuja as another incarnation of Vishnu, now treated both as a separate deity for adoption as one’s personal representation for personal worship (Ishtava) and as the place to see an epiphany of the Divine behind all specific deities. Ramanuja taught that there is only one Supreme Being and the plurality of manifestations is only images. For Ramanuja, images are not just a human concession or a means or see the divine through a glass darkly but the very thing that allows one to come to the divine. <em>The Bhagavad Gita </em>(XI) describes a scene where Arjuna asks to see God glory (as in Exodus), here at Tirumala it is theoretically everyone’s chance. However, when crowded, the devotee may only get a three to four second vision. </p>
<p>  The time in the Temple is exclusively for the vision of the statue. If one wants to offer personal prayers and make personal offerings, there is a place in the center courtyard to offer the traditional camphor flame, incense, flowers, and to make sacrifices of coconuts. See the photo below and notice that the tonsuring building is the white building about two blocks in the background.<br />

<p>The tonsuring building is a white brick building like a 1960s government or school building modified to be open for tonsuring and bathing.  One enters it from the bazaar area and it is on the border between the bazaar and the Temple area as a preparation for going further into the temple compound. This building also has the queuing metal grating in which people sat and hawked soap, toothbrushes, shampoo or even little kits- like a mikveh kit.  Inside the building,   Men are milling about soaping their hair before the tonsure, mothers are hovering over the haircuts of their sons, and people are waiting for friends. On the left hand side of my view was another corridor with men semi-dressed washing, showering, and bathing in preparation for the Temple visit.  Those who have had tonsuring have the treat of bathing in hot water, a luxury in India.</p>
<p>Men came into the building wearing their everyday clothes, started to disrobe to soap up their hair, had their hair shorn, and then went next door to wash, groom, and bath. They emerged wearing purified and wearing white dhotis; the virtuous gave their clothes away to the mendicants.   Unfortunately, the layout  of the building and the transformation of the men into shaved uniform wearing devotees made my Jewish eyes occasionally flash images of head shearing and showering upon entry to a concentration camp. The next step for the men in this case was to walk to the locker building to deposit their shoes and belongings in order to enter the long Temple queue barefoot and pure. </p>

As to the question of the relationship of sacrifice and tonsure: in a simple answer, they are not related. There are none of the signs of Hindu worship:, either camphor, incense, bell, or fruit. There are no statues or images of the divine. No Hindu ever worships wearing shoes, even shower shoes. For all religious homes, one takes off shoes before entering because they have a shrine in the home, this also applies to university rooms or businesses that have shrines. One would not make invocations or chants with shoes on. (See shoes in picture below.)These points are not dependent and language, translation, or regional difference. Pre-schoolers are already trained how to make offerings or worship. No local, regardless of education level, would confuse worship and tonsuring.  </p>
<p>What is the meaning of tonsuring? Tonsuring show one&#8217;s love for the Gods by washing away one&#8217;s past and starting anew. In some cases, someone with a closely shaved head is practicing celibacy. The hair is a symbolic offering of one’s beauty, and in return, one expects blessing. Tonsure can also be used for punishing people for severe crimes as well as a sign of giving up false-ego. According to the rules of the Vedas, the Chudakarana (tonsuring of hair) should be performed either in the first or the third year of the male child as a form of consecration.  In Northern India, tonsuring is limited to auspicious occasions. One of the graduate students shaved his head as a morning ritual for his grandmother. It is not uncommon to tonsure the head of a child after the death of a parent. The corpse, too, often receives the tonsure after death. A professor took her daughter to Tirumala for tonsuring as a way of creating an egalitarian equivalent to the boys’ ritual. In the Dharmashastra, Widows are required to tonsure. In Southern India, tonsuring is common as a regular form of votive piety done on a regular basis. Many Southern Indian temples have buildings for regular head shaving. In one city, I found the tonsuring building away from the Temple tucked amidst the concession stands. I bought Diet Coke in the next concession while watching.</p>
<p>Why tonsure at Tirumala? It is custom to make vows that are fulfilled at Tirupati. Vows are done partly because the religious life is filled with votive donations especially to be healed from illness, for children, or as thanks. And partly one makes vows as a spiritual preparation for entering the Temple sanctuary. Among the contemporary votive offerings includes the most popular walking up the 11km footpath to ascend the mountain especially among those in their late teens and twenties (your luggage meets you at the top). Angapradakshinam is when pilgrims lie prostrate, and then roll around the temple, chanting the Lord&#8217;s name.  Tulabharam is offering one&#8217;s weight in coins or other items such as gold, bananas, or sugar candy. Tulabharam is generally performed for children. Tonsuring is in the Kalyana Katta building described above but for the wealthier there are barbers set up in the hilltop hotels and guest cottages at the start of the hilltop so that they can bath and get dressed in their hotel rooms. Niluvudopidi is offering to the Lord the ornaments, etc., that one is wearing when one takes the vow. The biggest source of income for the Temple is from those who directly donate gold, jewels, or money; giving is meritorious.  The museum exhibited older forms of vows such as committing to wearing shoes that are a bed of nails while ascending the mountain. </p>
<p>For those who want more information, there are many firsthand accounts in books and online <a href="http://www.starsai.com/sri-venkateswara-tirumala-tirupati-darshan/comment-page-1/">here</a> and <a href="http://hairfetishers.blogspot.com/2012/09/venkanna-mokku-by-manisha.html">here</a> and <a href="http://llchennai.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/visiting-tirupati-tirumala">instructions for pilgrimage.</a></p>
<p>In a pair of scholarly articles by Benjamin Fleming and Annette Yoshiko Reed, the question  they pose is: what happens when Hinduism is confronted by someone who never heard about Hindu categories? According to this article, the rabbis paid “great attention to the details of the Hindu practices, but they interpreted them in conjunction with laws about Greco-Roman religion in the Mishnah and Talmud.” They did not understand that tonsuring is not the same as darshan (vision of a deity) or an offering to a god, and that the cutting of hair can be likened to the washing of dirt from the body. They also did not understand that barbering is not a temple ritual since it is done by low caste barbers—not Brahmins. The rabbis did not ask questions about the entire pilgrimage process to the Tirupati Temple complex or what is done as part of the pilgrimage.  In fact, one rabbi imagined he saw the hair actually brought as an offering and thought he was the only one acute to notice that the priest was sneaking the hair out to sell. Another rabbi thought that the stainless steel collection drum was a deity that was being feed. </p>
<p>In both articles, there was the prior assumption that this practice is idolatry; the only question is whether there was an offering. “The pilgrims were asked: If your intention is to give a present why do you cut it here and therefore have to wait for hours in a queue? Why don’t you cut it at home and send it to the God?” They received answers that it is more virtuous not to cut it at home therefore “we want to cut it here because here we are in a holy place[ . . .] and the idol loves our hair.” So they concluded it was forbidden. Eventually, this first thought was overruled with more information.” Leniencies to wear the hair were found by a variety of rabbis; some of their reasoning was based on the barber’s lack of intention for worship, on the tonsuring as a non-ritual act as defined in Greco-Roman terms and on the lack of probability that one has the Temple hair in one’s wig. </p>
<p>Fleming and Reed wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps most striking, in this regard, may be the manner in which the halakhic discourse about avodah zarah has served to efface the structural and ritual similarities between Jewish and Hindu practices surrounding the cutting of hair, precisely by virtue of the selective appeal to the cultic practice of the Jewish past (i.e., sacrifice in the Jerusalem Temple) as the model for the interpretation of non-Jewish ritual practice in the present. Tacit—perhaps already in the Mishnah—is the effacement of the very possibility of any parallels between avodah zarah and contemporary Jewish practice. &#8220;Hindu Hair and Jewish Halakha,&#8221; Studies in Religion (2011)</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted above, there is no offering or placing near the murti (statue) that was two blocks away and surrounded by fences and security. And, as Fleming and Reed note, it is worth studying why the rabbis worldview assumed that eye-witnesses, academics, and Brahmins were not telling them the truth. And that even if they the experts were telling the truth, they assumed that the average, unsophisticated worshipper confused bathhouse and Temple, as if an unlettered Jew in the shtetl would not be able to tell mikveh from synagogue or yizkor candle from menorah. The rabbis assumed that the average person could not tell the difference between a votive and sacrifice as if these practices were some ad-hoc rituals whose performance was not deeply embedded in the ritual practice of daily life or that the pilgrimage process would be confusing to its practitioners.  In addition, they did not realize utilizing a Hindi speaking translator to communicate to Tamil and Telugu speakers and to translate from there into broken English would not be able to translate terms properly. </p>

<p>The Chief Brahmin at the Temple has a doctorate in molecular biology. The approach is more old time Torah uMadda of becoming a Rabbi Dr. than you would have imagined. His sons all have graduate degrees and the finances of the Temple are administered by people who have MBAs.  Temple Hinduism is about following the ritual procedure as proscribed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80gama_(Hinduism)">Agamic books</a> as interpreted by experts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaikhanasas">These works</a> have generally not been translated into English and the rituals are not the same as the primordial Veda or dharmashastra texts which, in contrast, have been translated in Western introductory books. For those trying to understand Hinduism the discussion is about observance of the ritual as interpreted by experts, closer to halakhah then hasidut. The Chief Brahmin explains why the elaborate Temple ritual is for the benefit of the laity. Below are some quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. A.V. Ramana Dikshitulu is the head Priest at the Balaji temple in Tirupati . He holds a doctorate in molecular biology and is an inimitable authority on the Agamas&#8221;, the crucially important Vedic scriptures. </p>
<p><strong>Can you please<a href="http://srivenkatesa.org/index.php/srivaikhanasam/688-sri-vaikhanasa-agamam-part-2-tirumala"> describe the &#8220;Vaikhanasa Agama&#8221;</a> and explain why it is important?</strong><br />
All of the Agamas elucidate the science of ritual but the &#8220;Vaikhanasa Agama&#8221; is unique in that it gives more detail concerning the performance of ritual, both in the temple and in the home . The &#8220;Vaikhanasa Agama,&#8221;  written by Sage Vikhanasa, is one of four main &#8220;Vaishnava Agamas.&#8221;  The &#8220;Vaikhasana Agama&#8221; exists in two parts: the first part deals with rituals that are done in the temple and to the Deity whereas the second part deals with purification ceremonies that a priest must undergo in order to qualify to serve in the temple.</p>
<p>The temple rituals are designed to keep the laymen&#8217;s physical senses satisfied. This is done by making the process personal.<br />
It describes how the Deity is treated as we would like to be treated ourselves. He is put to sleep at night and awakened in the morning. He is given a bath and dressed in fine silks, jeweled ornaments and fragrant flowers . He is fed a variety of fine foods. Finally, he is carried in grand procession around the temple. As we all know, the dearest thing to man is man. We know God will be happy if we do for Him what we would do for ourselves.</p>
<p>Although the &#8220;Vaikhanasa Agama&#8221; is available to be read by anyone who knows Sanskrit, it is not easily understood, even by Sanskrit scholars, because of its coded language. The verses have double meanings; the valuable inner meanings can only be perceived by those who meditate deeply upon the verses . Even then, only those at a certain level of spiritual evolution can grasp the deepest meaning. We conduct workshops to stimulate this understanding in our Priests.</p>
<p><strong>Are the principles of the &#8220;Vaikhanasa Agama &#8221; to be implemented only by Priests?</strong><br />
This Agama is for people who have no other purpose on Earth but to worship Lord Vishnu. Yes, it is for Priests&#8211; Priests who will take up no other vocation. Take me, for example. I am a doctor in molecular biology. Yet, I am a Priest. My elder son is an expert in computers and has a college degree in finance and marketing. My second son is an electrical engineer, and my third son is a bio-chemist. Yet they are also Priests. Like me, they serve here in the Balaji temple in Tirumala.<br />
From your perspective as a priest, how may devotees receive their greatest benefit from a pilgrimage to Tirumala?<br />
If we pray to such a powerful Lord as Balaji for minor things like a promotion, a transfer, a seat in medical college or a marriage proposal, it is possible that these wishes will be granted. But making such requests is like asking for a spoonful of water from an ocean. There is something so much greater to be had here: spiritual evolution. Through the ages, man has evolved both technically and spiritually. However, further spiritual evolution must now take place, for man is still spiritually primitive. It is natural during this Kali Yuga (age of darkness) that we be more attracted to worldly pleasures and ignore spiritual pursuits. To have even a preliminary understanding of the spiritual path during these difficult times depends largely upon one&#8217;s personal &#8221; karmas .&#8221;  These are &#8220;karmas&#8221; brought over from previous births. <a href="http://kirtimukha.com/chinnamma/sahasra/VaikhanasaAgama.htm">Read the rest of the interview here.</a>

				<p>Indian academia is booming; every department in every university is gaining  faculty members. New dormitories are popping up all over campuses. At Banares Hindu University alone, 650 new faculty members are being hired.  IT, Bio-medical Technology, Engineering, and Medicine have the most new positions, yet even majors such as Philosophy, Dance, and Peace Studies are each gaining several new faculty members. If there is an Indian national out there with a specialty in Jewish Philosophy and Kabbalah, then he or she would be almost guaranteed a position. Currently,  the Indian universities only have a few Political Scientists whom are familiar with Israel studies, but there are no faculty members whom are well versed in Jewish philosophy And because of this rarity, the institution would be quick to snatch up a specialist.  (There is one odd Indian professor in a regional college who gives academic talks that summarize his newspaper clippings on the Indian-Israel relationship or newspaper human interest stories about the remaining Jews in India). Below is a picture of the building that houses the department of Philosophy &amp; Religion, as well as the Psychology department.</p>

<p>This month is application month.  Tens of thousands of applicants descended on the campus to try for admissions.  They make journeys from small towns hoping to change their futures by rising out of the working class and becoming a civil servant or even a doctor or IT worker. In philosophy and history, about 850 apply in each field to be BA freshmen, only about fifty are accepted as students. The ratios are worse in the sciences.  </p>
<p>The spring semester in India officially starts in the first week of January but in the north, it is the winter season and still cold and clammy with 40 degree temperature. So every day, the instructors come in and decide if there will be classes that day or if the weather still too cold. No one will ever say that we start mid-month or that there is no class tomorrow as they would at a western institution; rather, every department goes through this ritual on a daily basis to decide it is still too cold. </p>
<p>The language of instruction is  English as is the one universal language for the diverse student body. My Indian Hindu class included Thai and Cambodian Buddhists monks, a Cambodian woman, two Tibetans, a native of Ladakh whose native tongue was Ladakhian, an Indian convert to Christianity, as well as a “Western” Australian son of a minister.  The campus, as the largest in South East Asia, has many students from Thailand and Cambodia. Thailand contributes a large annual fee to cover all the Thai students and their needs. There is also a special dormitory just for Thai Buddhist monks.</p>
<p>In January, there was a student strike with the cancellation of classes for the day because they raised tuition by over 300% for next year. Bonfires were lit and various objects thrown at officials in protest. (I did not directly enter the crowd and watch because the State dept gave us Fulbrighters a warning to not stand in the sidelines of even seemingly peaceful protests. From behind the barricades, I could see that this protest already had gas masks and possibly tear gas. Here is someone else&#8217;s report.) </p>
<blockquote><p>strike at BHU. all gates are closed. unable to egress or enter&#8230;students protesting on rise of tuition by 5x. but many of them are just joining the wall to be loud and boisterous&#8230;. Issues: teachers not teaching their classes, not announcing when they will not be attending yet demanding we be on time, lack of planned syllabus and homework, lack of clean  bathrooms in hostels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now here is the punch line- they were going to raise tuition from 480 Rupees to 1500 Rupees which is US $7.73 to $24.15.  This small amount, by American standards, was enough to start a protest. The university gave in by the early afternoon. (For the dormitory and daily hot lunch they pay 2000 Rupees a semester, about 32 American Dollars.)</p>
<p>The Philosophy and Religion department teaches the classic philosophic works of Hinduism and Buddhism under the rubric of Indian philosophy and focusing specifically in Nyaya, Vedanta, Brahma Sutra, Buddhist Yogacara as well as logic and Western thought. Classes treat each Indian approach as a separate worldview, a darshan, and they treat Plato, Hume, Kant, Wittgenstein, and Rawls the same way as separate worldviews.  There is little analysis or theory. The large faculty is predominately from old Brahmin families. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saryupareen_Brahmins">Saryupareen Brahmins</a> with one Buddhist from an untouchable background and one Christian woman from a tribal background. The Social Science department was only a little more diverse. </p>
<p>I taught Judaism- as part of a course on Western religions- and Comparative Religion- both required courses. The Judaism course provided an inside into how India views Judaism. As noted in previous blog posts, the Indian people know Judaism mainly from Christian, anti-Judaism citations or as the religion of Leviticus. At the start of the course, I was repeatedly asked questions like: You got rid of animal sacrifices due to the 19th and 20th century reformers? Was it a 10th century revivalist who taught you to stop doing sacrifices? Did you substitute a coconut, the way some Hindu communities do?  I downplayed this line of thinking to avoid leading into the New Testament and started with mizvot, Sinai, Oral law, and Rabbinical Judaism.  I also had the professor who normally teaches the course sit in on every lesson taking copious notes for his future lectures.</p>
<p>The class  saw Maimonides as part of the Yogic tradition in that for Maimonides one overcomes the ignorance and drives of the natural condition through intellectual training. They related to blessings and names of God as magical mantras. (Jews tend to misuse use the word “mantra” which is a word that has power with the concept of japa- the reputation of a word for devotion.) They liked Kabbalah as dualistic dvaiata Vedanta like Madhva and dislike Hasidut as emotionalism that cannot liberate. Like the ibn Ezra, they treated ritual and mussar statements as scientific. And in the Yogic tradition, debated Maimonides, Nahmanides, and Emergence of Ethical Man on the fallen state that we need to raise ourselves from. They went right for the verse that Adam was only permitted vegetation and saw the ideal even in the Bible as vegetarianism the way Albo read the verse.  They liked all the 20th century thinkers especially Rav Kook and Heschel.  The professor who sat in on the class proclaimed about how the Humash is different than other scriptures in that here it is “God in search of Man.” </p>
<p>The required Comparative Religion course was a bit trickier to teach. The textbook was an inverse of a Christian colonial approach. The British books proved the superiority of Christianity over Hinduism and the goal of the Hindu version was to prove the superiority of Hinduism over Christianity, which was better at offering liberation. All the other religions of the world, Judaism Included, were not seen as contenders.  The last chapter of the book was on whether we can all agree to become one religion. The book’s perspective left it as a problem since there is not enough commonality, people won’t accept a religion that is not theirs, and no one will accept a new religion. I started with that chapter and explained that is not how we do comparative religion, philosophy, or theology in the West.  In principle, we do not compare theologies to create a new religion.  It gave me a chance to explain the new no-reductive approaches of the theology of other religions. </p>
<p>In general, their book was  19th century approach of looking for the essence of each religion in 8-10 statements and then comparing the supposed essences. The book had no interest in manifestation. For example, one the essence of Judaism or Islam was defined, then the actual texts of the Talmud or Koran/Hadith play no role in the discussion; they could even be seen as irrelevant to the essence.  </p>
<p>I went about my own way and started with William James, Mircea Eliade, and Western views of mysticism.  In this approach, I learned how they see religion. For example, they rejected James idea of religion and mysticism as a personal feeling done alone to the alone. For them, one requires a guru to teach you how to control your body and mind and one needs to submit to an ashram and to practice the classical techniques. </p>
<p>At one point, I spoke to the PHD philosophy students about how to do research and develop a thesis; some of them had been my friends ever since. One Friday, one of the PhD students came up to me to say that he is dropping out of the program and moving to Delhi. Why? He is very uncomfortable around women and cannot talk to them. He says he grew up in a home of strict separation of the sexes which was very strict about what each sex says to the other, even sibling do not cross the line. So like Raj on the Big Bang theory he cannot talk to women one to one. </p>
<p>Well on this particular Friday he asked a girl to marry him and she said no. The girl is doing a PhD is philosophy and the boy was doing a PhD in philosophy just to be near her. He says he has loved her for three years already but never took her out on a date or a private cup of coffee n campus. He did not really speak to her and never told her about his attraction for three years. After years of silence, instead of asking her on a date or out to coffee, he  approaches her with “I have been madly in love with you for three years and will you marry me.“ He says he really didn’t want to do philosophy but it kept him close to her. He feels he wasted three years and will now go to Delhi and sit for the civil servant exam. I would have thought he was pulling my leg as a prank if I did not know the students involved or did not keep abreast of his transfer process.</p>
<p>I was asked many times over the course of my time India what my views on Hitler are. They ask: “What do I think of Hitler?” These students have no context of Western or Jewish history, have never heard of Anti-Semitism except as  19th century Christian and German Aryan truths about the Jew. Few adhere in a meaningful way to the ideas of human rights, crimes against humanity, or genocide. For them, Hitler was just a ruthless leader who defended Germany against her enemies and who took a semi-feudal country having trouble adjusting to modernity and drafted the populous into building factories, autobahn, and cars for all. All virtues in today’s India and Mein Kampf is for sale at every train station.  Their question and curiosity is based in innocence.</p>
<p>From their perspective, there are always genocides. The Chinese do not make their loss of six million civilians by the Japanese into the center of their story. Or, for example, I asked the two Cambodia Buddhist monks whom were enrolled in the program how  did they revive Buddhism after the killing fields of the late 1970’s when 2-3 million were killed, especially the monks.  They answered that the Khmer Rouge destroyed everything but some of the monks fled to Vietnam and returned after the war to rebuild the religion and rebuild the monasteries. They are doing very well and are already the second generation after the destruction.  Many spend their late adolescence in the monastery and are ordained as monks at 20 and then become laymen except for those who either become officiates or academics. These two monks studying for an MA saw their story as a triumph of survival over the forces of destruction.</p>
