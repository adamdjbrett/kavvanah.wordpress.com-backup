				<p>Do you ever get frustrated when someone preaches a liberal universal doctrine and then tell you the only way to know that universal is through Orthodoxy?  When everyone, especially those who are non-religious, already accept a universal ideal but it is claimed to be only available to the faithful. Well we get that full force in a new book by Rob Bell, <em>Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell, and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived </em>(HarperOne).</p>
<p>Bell teaches that God’s love is greater than Christianity but one needs to be an Evangelical to know that about God. His book is turning into the biggest print and internet controversy in a while. Many clergy spoke about him last week or will speak this week. The internet is spreading this controversy rapidly.</p>
<p>Bell who draws 10, 000 to his service at his Mars Hill Church in Grand Rapids but all across North America he has a big constituency.  His liberalism seems to be where many Evangelicals are currently at in their faith. But that is why there is a controversy. Bell speaks liberalism even though he is a card carrying Evangelical. Bell teaches that religious belief wont affect afterlife. He offers a warn, kind, and comfortable version of Christianity. All the tenets are palpable. His theology can be seen as overcoming a strict Evangelical upbringing. Once upon a time people sorted themselves out by liberal and evangelical and knew the categories. But now that liberal and evangelical refer just as much to schools, seminaries, summer camps and neighborhoods, we have people raised in the Evangelical world who are completely liberal. </p>
<p>Evangelicals have condemned him and liberals have found him too parochial by saying that universalism is only in the Church. What I find interesting is the nature of the arguments. Most of his critiques and critics have not actually read his book outside of the press release, blogs, and a chapter or two. Bell is called a heretic by the Evangelical right and called names but one see little actually engagement with the theological issues. </p>
<p>Only Martin Bashir of MSNBC took Rob Bell apart as lacking theology.  Bashir  himself said about most interviews:</p>
<blockquote><p>One Christian radio program interviewed Bashir about his questions… Bashir begins, for instance, by pointing out that most people who do interviews such as this haven’t even read the book. He says he did read the book, also went to two academic libraries, and interviewed three scholars (including two with no religious affiliation) and found the book to be evasive, disingenuous and ahistorical. Much of the interview gets into discussions of theology, history, the challenges with the type of evangelicalism Bell was raised in, etc. The questions aren’t the most interesting but Bashir’s answers do give lots to think about journalism and how it is practiced <a href="http://www.getreligion.org/2011/03/a-palatable-comfortable-christianity">h/t getrelgion</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the video to see Rob Bell squirm.<br />

<p>Mark Galli  of the Evangelical magazine Christianity Today tears Rob Bell to shreds from an <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/april/lovewins.html">Evangelical perspective here. </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The prepublication buzz centered on Bell&#8217;s flirtation with universalism. He makes the universalist case most fully in one chapter, while avoiding the word universalist. He points out the many New Testament passages that point in this direction, </p>
<p>It&#8217;s rhetorically compelling, but he misleads at points. </p>
<p>In fact, he says, both Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection can be understood in ways that make perfect sense to modern ears. For Bell, the Cross is &#8220;a symbol of an elemental reality, one we all experience,&#8221; and the Resurrection is not a new concept, but &#8220;something that has always been true. It&#8217;s how the world works.&#8221; He&#8217;s referring to that pattern of death and rebirth.</p>
<p>One has to ask, then, if Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection are merely an expression of &#8220;how the universe works,&#8221; why all the bother? Why do we need Jesus to come and die and rise when this is something we see daily in the fabric of the universe, a knowledge that, as Bells suggests, we have instinctively sensed all along? </p>
<p>He correctly notes in the preface that many have taught what he teaches or hints at in the book. Names that come immediately to mind include Friedrich Schleiermacher, Albrecht Ritschl, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Tillich. Schleiermacher was keen on mining our innate religious sensibilities (the things we&#8217;ve intuited are true) to ground Christian faith. Ritschl celebrated the kingdom ethics of Jesus. Bultmann argued that first-century metaphors and worldviews should be abandoned. Tillich wrote of faith as accepting our acceptance. All these themes run through Bell&#8217;s book, sometimes in compelling ways. </p>
<p>These thinkers, of course, are all representatives of the tradition called liberal Protestantism. By associating Bell with this tradition, I&#8217;m not suggesting that he is beyond the pale or that he holds no orthodox views. I&#8217;m trying to place him in theological context. </p>
<p>Most Christians grasp that to demythologize one doctrine is to make the others less coherent. They recognize that a Christianity that teaches about &#8220;a God without wrath [who] brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a Cross&#8221; (H. Richard Niebuhr&#8217;s classic summary of liberalism) does not reflect the thickness of biblical revelation nor lived reality. And they see that when all is said and done, there is no painful contradiction between the love and justice of God. That in the end, not only does love win, but justice, too</p></blockquote>
<p>From an <a href="http://trevinwax.com/2011/03/15/rob-bell-love-wins-taking-evangelicalisms-temperature/">Evangelical blog asking</a>: why is this is about groups of liberal and conservatives and not about theology?:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> Taking Evangelicalism’s Temperature By Trevin Wax </em><br />
The furor over Rob Bell’s new book, Love Wins, shows no signs of subsiding. The development of the discussion has caused me to reflect on what a fever is and what it represents. <strong>Fevers don’t show up without a cause</strong>. A high temperature points to a bigger problem. It’s the sign that the immune system has kicked in and is fighting off an infection of some sort.<br />
Response #1: The Fever is the Problem<br />
When bloggers and pastors began responding to the promotional materials for Love Wins, many evangelicals used the occasion to point out their disagreement with the young, restless, and Reformed instead of dealing with the substantive issues Bell’s book brings to the surface. Conservative evangelicals sounded the alarm that Bell’s book was unorthodox, and a number of evangelicals threw stones at the messengers: You’re an alarmist. You’re just a bunch of heresy hunters. You can’t get along with anyone you disagree with.<br />
Imagine being in a crowded building when the fire alarm goes off. Instead of looking for the fire or heading for the exit, everyone stands around the alarm and begins discussing its shortcomings:<br />
“Wow, this alarm sounds so shrill. It hurts my ears. Someone should change the tone!”<br />
“Who pulled this alarm anyway? I don’t smell any smoke. I don’t see a reason for the warning.”<br />
“Well, I can smell smoke, but I’ve got to tell you – these alarms just go looking for smoke. Who do they think they are anyway?”<br />
In other words, fevered discussion of theological truth and error is the problem. The fever is the issue. Why not take a Tylenol and some Dramamine and chill out?</p>
<p>Response #2: The Body is Okay with Infection<br />
Rob Bell’s universalistic tendencies are nothing new. In fact, we’ve always had a segment of evangelicals who lean in this direction. So let’s not get too worked up about universalism. After all, the denial or redefinition of hell isn’t that big of a deal in the long run.<br />
To be fair, this kind of evangelical isn’t denying that universalism is heterodox. Returning to the sickness metaphor, I believe this group sees universalism as problematic. But the underlying message is this: This problem isn’t life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelicalism has always been a big tent. The question before us today is, How big can the tent be before it caves in? How big can the tent be before “evangelical” means nothing more than “a professing Christian who is serious about what he/she believes”?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>From the New York Times treating it as a media craze&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/us/05bell.html?_r=2">Pastor Stirs Wrath With His Views on Old Questions</a> By ERIK ECKHOLM<br />
Published: March 4, 2011 </p>
<blockquote><p>His book comes as the evangelical community has embraced the Internet and social media to a remarkable degree, so that a debate that once might have built over months in magazines and pulpits has instead erupted at electronic speed. </p>
<p>By that same evening, “Rob Bell” was one of the top 10 trending topics on Twitter. Within 48 hours, Mr. Taylor’s original blog had been viewed 250,000 times. Dozens of other Christian leaders and bloggers jumped into the fray and thousands of their readers posted comments on both sides of the debate, though few had yet seen the entire book. </p>
<p> “Rob Bell is tapping into a younger generation that really wants to open up these questions,” he said. “He is also tapping into the fear of the traditionalists — that these differing views of heaven and hell will compromise the Christian message.”<br />
While sliding close to what critics consider the heresy of “universalism” — that all humans will eventually be saved — he never uses the term. </p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/files/2011/03/LoveWinsReview.pdf">a pdf manifesto</a> of an Evangelical conservative. This one phrased the controversy in terms similar to Orthodox Judaism. </p>
<blockquote><p>Love Wins has ignited such a firestorm of controversy because it’s the current fissure point for a larger fault-line. As younger generations come up against an increasingly hostile cultural environment, they are breaking in one of two directions—back to robust orthodoxy (often Reformed) or back to liberalism. The neo-evangelical consensus is cracking up. Love Wins is simply one of many tremors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, those who want to give an informed theological sermon from the range of Evangelical thought should see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Views-Salvation-Pluralistic-World/dp/0310212766/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t">Four views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Views-Hell-William-Crockett/dp/0310212685/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300826670&amp;sr=8-4">Four Views on Hell</a>  and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Views-Eternal-Security-Matthew-Pinson/dp/0310234395/ref=pd_sim_b_3">Four views on Eternal Security.</a> These books give a range of kosher Evangelical opinions, from orthodox left to engaged right.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Elie Wiesel is known for making up his own Hasidic tales to fit his ideas of arguing with God and his views of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misotheism">misotheism</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misotheism#Terminology">dystheism.</a> I used to get lots of phone calls trying to identify Wiesel’s original Hasidic tales. Buber may take out the particualism of Torah uMizvot to make a story with universal appeal but you can always identify the original story. Wiesel is confident and free enough to invent things, put lines from Camus and Doestoevsky in the mouth of his Hasidic protagonists and make his Hasidim share his angry arguing with a God for His evil deeds. Wiesel screams at his critics that the story was from his childhood teachers and his critics were not there in Sighet where he claims tohave heard the stories.  </p>
<p>But it seems Wiesel has also applied his craft of memoir (he rejects the label novelist) directly to Martin Buber. There is a story about the Jewish-Christian encounter that seemed not to be like Buber in thought or character for several reasons. The false story downplays the difference between the faiths since the real Buber was a harsh critic of Christianity.  The story has an agnostic or relative edge to it- the real Buber was a believer in a universalism of hallowed everyday action. And the real Buber was not seeking to be pragmatically cleaver in a &#8220;got you&#8221; kind of way. </p>
<p>After emailing many people, it seem that the origin of the story is Elie Wiesel in the late 1980’s. Many people picked it up as a true. Using this story skewers real positions. Here is the probably phony story:</p>
<blockquote><p>My good friends, what is the difference between you and me? Both of us, all of us believe, because we are religious, in the coming of the Messiah. You believe that the Messiah came, went back, and that you are waiting for Him for the second coming. We Jews believe He hasn&#8217;t come yet, but He will come. In other words, we are waiting. You for the second coming, we for the first coming. Let&#8217;s wait together.&#8221; After a pause, he said, &#8220;And when He will come, we will ask Him, have you been here before?&#8221; Said Buber, &#8220;I hope I will be behind Him and I will whisper in His ear, please do not answer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Elie Wiesel, All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs (New York: Knopf, 1995), pp. 354-55.<br />
Or from Wiesel&#8217;s commencement <a href="http://www.humanity.org/printview.php?page=wiesel_at_depaul&amp;sectionName=voices">Speech at Depaul</a></p>
<p>Now back to the real Buber.<br />
In his <em>Two Types of Faith </em>Buber distinguishes between  two kinds of faith. The Hebraic emunah: total trust and reliance on God; where one shows trust through actions.  Paul&#8217;s version of faith is pistis: a more intellectual belief in the cognitive truth of something.  </p>
<p>The closest you will find in Buber’s actual writings to anything like alleged story is in &#8220;The Two Foci of the Jewish Soul&#8221; in <em>Israel and the World</em>, p. 39 (pages varies between editions) he asks, speaking of differences of Jews and Christians: &#8220;what do you and we have in common?&#8221; And he answers:&#8221; A book and an expectation.&#8221; Then he goes on to say: &#8220;But we can wait for the advent of the One together, and there are moments when we may prepare the way before him together&#8230;.&#8221; Even here we find Buber speaking of preparing the way through holy action.</p>
<p>Whenever Buber did encounter other faiths he always stressed the immediacy of the present moment.  He found commonalities between religions in ecstasy, service, intention, humility&#8212;not messianic doctrine. Truth is opening oneself up to others. One is to strive for transparency and pure I-Thou dialogue, not hiding truth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Religiosity, I say, is the urge of man to live in commune with the unconditioned, and his will to bring this about through his deeds and into the world of man&#8230; True religiosity is doing&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Having awakened to an awareness of their universal being, individual beings open themselves to one another, disclose themselves to one another, help one another.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To become human is what we are created for&#8221;, and approaching God is only possible by becoming human.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until I hear otherwise, I will take it as a story imposing an alien theology on Buber. </p>

				<p>From last Year &#8211; “Masekhet Purim”, a humorous parody of the Talmud, is believed to have  first been written in the first half of the 14th century by Kalonymus  ben Kalonymus. It later developed into several different versions. <a href="http://www.hebrewbooks.org/33628">Here  is the</a> Kol Bo L’Purim with the Kiddish, hagadah, selichot,  teshuvot, akdamot, and more. Download it- It is only 31 pages, bring  it with you on Purim</p>
<p>This year VBM provided a translation of the R. Chaim Vital and Rav Nachman on why one must drink &#8220;until one does not know.&#8221; Here are the basic translations with some of the context. <a href="http://vbm-torah.org/archive/chag71/purim71.htm"><br />
Full 10 page version from VBM here. </a> <a href="http://breslov.org/dvar-torah-for-purim/"><br />
Very short Cliff notes version</a> from Ozer Bergman.</p>
<p><strong>Purim in Chassidic Thought: “Until He Doesn&#8217;t Know” By Rav Itamar Eldar</strong></p>
<p>The gemara cites the following statement in the name of Rava:<br />
<strong>A person is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai.&#8221; (Megilla 7b)</strong></p>
<p><strong>It seems to demand nullification of the intellect to the point of losing the capacity to clearly distinguish between Haman being evil and Mordekhai being blessed.</strong> Jewish thought, and Chassidic thought in particular, attempted to reach a deeper understanding of this law – drinking wine to the point of drunkenness – which has become one of the central features of Purim.</p>
<p>R. Chayyim Vital writes as follows in the name of his teacher, the Arizal:</p>
<blockquote><p>That which our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, that a person is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; – this means as follows: It is known that in every kelipa there is a spark of holiness that gives it life, and should it be removed, [the kelipa] will be left with no vitality and immediately it will totally disappear. <strong>Now on this great day, when there is this great illumination, we want the vitality of this illumination to reach this spark as well</strong>, but not that it should reach so far to illuminate the kelipa. For this reason a person must get drunk on this day, to the point that he does not know the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai.&#8221; For he may err and give a blessing to that spark in the kelipa, and it too will be blessed, but its blessing will not have perfect intention, for if it would have, it would receive a great deal and the kelipa would also be blessed. [Alternate reading: Therefore he must say &#8220;blessed Haman,&#8221; to draw light also to that spark, and therefore he must say it without intention, since he is drunk and has already lost his mind. For were it with intention, God forbid, it would also illuminate the kelipa.] (Peri Etz Chayyim, Sha&#8217;ar Rosh Chodesh, Chanuka U-Purim, ch. 6)</p></blockquote>
<p>The key to these questions seems to lie in understanding the state of the kelipa and the Divine spark concealed within it. As R. Chayyim Vital puts it, &#8220;It is known that in every kelipa, there is a spark of holiness that gives it life.&#8221; The kelipa, which symbolizes the evil found in the world, exists by virtue of the Divine spark that is concealed within it and gives it life. <strong>Without that Divine spark hidden within it, it could not exist. The ramifications of this point are important. The kabbalistic reference to the &#8220;Divine spark giving life to the kelipa&#8221; asserts that the very fact of evil&#8217;s existence is its meaning, and that it is by the will and intention of God that it continues to exist.</strong><br />
THE GOAL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT TO KNOW</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge, as it is expressed in the words of the Arizal, involves a restriction and limitation of light, and in this manner, a blessing may be given to evil. R. Natan adopts an entirely different approach in the name of his teacher, R. Nachman of Breslov:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the aspect of &#8220;A person is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8216;cursed Haman&#8217; and &#8216;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; (Megilla 7b). For Purim is the primary [time] for subjugating the filth of the serpent, which is sadness, the aspect of &#8220;in sorrow shall you eat of it&#8221; (Bereishit 3:17), as stated above. At that time, we must raise the joy from the depths of the kelipot… until we merit by way of the joy to achieve the aspect of the nine palaces as stated above, through which we attain the infinite light … which is the aspect of the goal of knowledge that we are not to know, as stated above. Therefore, a person is obligated to drink, that is, to get drunk on Purim for the sake of the joy, as it is written: &#8220;Wine that gladdens the heart of man&#8221; (Tehilim 104:15). And he must increase the joy until he merits by way of the drunkenness and the joy of Purim to reach the aspect of the goal of knowledge that we are not to know, which is the aspect of &#8220;until he no longer knows, etc.&#8221; For the primary hold of good and evil, which is the aspect of &#8220;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; and &#8220;cursed Haman,&#8221; is from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the root of which stems from &#8220;nirgan mafrid aluf&#8221; (&#8220;a whisperer separates close friends;&#8221; Mishlei 16:18). That is, it separates the aspect of Keter, which is the aspect of alef, the aspect of wonder which orders and settles the minds, thereby preventing the minds from their pursuit. For the primary attainment of knowledge is precisely the aspect of the goal of knowing that we are not to know. For the aspect of not knowing is the primary goal of knowledge. For he who merits this, knowledge and lack of knowledge are contained together, they being the aspect of pursuit and hindrance, which are truly one at their root. Then evil is altogether nullified, for the primary hold of evil is the lack of knowledge and its concealment, which follows from the excessive light that causes the vessels to shatter. This is because they do not contain knowledge and lack of knowledge together (as will be further explained below with God&#8217;s help). <strong>Therefore, on Purim we must get drunk to the point that we reach such joy until we merit the aspect of the aforementioned goal of knowledge, where pursuit and hindrance are combined, they being knowledge and lack of knowledge. The two are combined together in the aspect of the goal of knowledge that we are not to know, where all evil is entirely nullified, as explained above. This is the aspect of &#8220;until he no longer knows the difference between &#8216;cursed Haman&#8217; and &#8216;blessed Mordekhai.'&#8221; For there we cannot talk about good and evil, for there all is one, all is good, as mentioned above. </strong>(Likutei Halakhot, Hilkhot Nefilat Apayim 4:7)</p></blockquote>
<p>R. Natan identifies the obligation to be unable to differentiate between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; with one of the fundamental principles in the thought of R. Nachman of Breslov, the paradoxical assertion that the goal of knowledge is that we are not to know.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, R. Natan writes as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, one is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai.&#8221; For there he is above knowledge, and there it is inappropriate to say, &#8220;cursed Haman,&#8221; for there it is entirely good, above the middot, above days of good and days of evil, as stated above. This is the aspect of the secret of the red heifer, which is the aspect of statute (chuka), above knowledge: it defiles the ritually pure and purifies the ritually impure. This secret will remain incomprehensible until the future when the hidden Torah will be revealed, as stated above. (Likutei Halakhot, Hilkhot Purim 4:5)</p></blockquote>
<p>Waiving knowledge is, indeed, a little scary, just as it is a little scary to put on a mask and lose our appearance.</p>
<p>At this frightening moment, a moment without knowledge, a moment of drunkenness, we can do nothing but look inwards, into ourselves, into our essence, into the center of knowledge – to the Ein within us, which is only revealed when we remove all the garments. At this moment, there is no cursed and no blessed, no profane and no holy, no impure and no pure – there is only blessed silence, that allows us for a moment to look at the Ein, at repentance which is above the Torah.</p>
<p>The foundation of repentance that disregards the world of phenomena and seeks the blessing of the essence reveals itself not only when we get drunk on Purim to the point that we no longer know the difference between cursed Haman and blessed Mordekhai,</p>

				<p>I had heard that Rabbi Steven Burg, of the OU had proposed at the recent OU convention setting up a Mormon style mission for young Orthodox adults. [This was updated for the correct attribution.] Burg said all he has to provide is transportation. I was puzzled on many accounts. How did he know of the Mormon mission system? Did he realize that it requires those who go on mission to live simple lives without the distractions of materialism, entertainment, or that even email is allowed only once a week? (We have taken the gap-year in Israel programs and made sure no one is derived of their materialism and creature comforts.) Finally, did he realize that mission is the “Torah” of Mormons and was he going to move the Orthodox religious imperative from Torah and mizvot to mission? </p>
<p>I then discovered that the LA Jewish Journal has a non-Jewish Mormon regular columnist Mark Paredes who writes “Jews and Mormons” about his explorations in Judaism, especially Orthodoxy. It seems our Mormon friend is a regular at the OU conventions. And yes, Mormonism is discussed, and Rabbi Steve Weil, head of the OU was willing to tolerate an inner orthodoxy of commitment and ethics, rather than an outer ritual one.(If he accomplishes this it will create a very different Orthodoxy, one even more Americanized.)  </p>
<p>From the Mormon side of things, there seems to be a Mormon –Orthodox Jewish dialogue going on. It may not discuss the revelation of the book of Neppi to the latter day saints but it certainly discusses religious values. I have known that Rabbi Bleich and others have given legal presentations about halakhah at Mormon institutions but the nature of this discussion was much more religious life. From Mark Paredes&#8217; account and the OU call for Mormon mission one gets a sense that the Rabbis are being transformed from their discussions with him and other Mormons; a new era of acculturation into American religion. </p>
<p>As a side point, it was interesting that Burg expresses what the recently departed archbishop of Stockholm and interfaith expert Krister Stendehl called “holy envy.” That I can appreciate something in another faith and wish to explore adapting what I learn in another faith for Judaism. </p>
<blockquote><p>The Orthodox Union on Christmas Eve:<br />
Posted by Mark Paredes<br />
Since I will be celebrating Christmas with my family next week in Michigan, I decided to spend Christmas Eve with observant Jews attending the annual Orthodox Union’s Torah Convention. The first Christmas Eve OU event that I attended was a 2006 debate on Orthodoxy between Dennis Prager and my good friend Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, and I’ve been hooked ever since. Tonight a few dozen people gathered at the regal home of Dr. Steven Tabak and his better half Linda to hear two of America’s great rabbis share their thoughts on defining Jewish values.  They discussed several topics that are of interest to Mormons, and the LDS Church was mentioned several times. The discussion lasted two and a half hours, and was so wide-ranging that the rabbis only managed to address one of three questions that the eloquent moderator, Rabbi Adir Posy, had planned to cover. No one present seemed to mind.</p>
<p>Rabbi Steven Weil, the OU’s National Executive VP, began his presentation by identifying Jewish parents as being primarily responsible for the transmission of Jewish values and moral character to their children, with schools and synagogues serving as concentric circles around the parents. This responsibility requires parents to behave in an ethical manner so that their children will be drawn to Judaism; hypocrisy on their part will cause their kids to leave the faith. Rabbi Weil went on to say that it is ethical behavior, not outward signs of Orthodoxy like Sabbath observance, that truly characterizes an Orthodox Jew. He could have easily made the same speech to Mormon parents. </p>
<p>The rabbis were kind enough to include me in the discussion by mentioning that both of them have engaged in dialogue with LDS leaders and praising Mormons’ desire to work with Orthodox Jews on school vouchers and other issues of interest to both communities (the LDS Church does not take an official position on vouchers). They also mentioned Mormons while addressing two issues: tithing and excommunication of unethical members of their community. Both rabbis appeared to advocate an arrangement of lifetime tithing for the Orthodox in exchange for the provision of certain services, including tuition for their children at Orthodox day schools. They pointed to the LDS Church as a model to be followed in this regard (i.e., the building of chapels, temples, universities). </p>
<p>When an audience member asked whether Mormons debate similar issues, I was asked to respond. <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/jews_and_mormons/item/the_orthodox_union_on_christmas_eve_tithing_excommunication_mormons_and_mar/">Read the rest here.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Below we have an Orthodox rabbi teaching our Mormon about the faith of Judaism. </p>
<blockquote><p>The Jewish tradition doesn’t interpret scripture literally, but it sure loves science. Those two principles formed the basis of last week’s “Torah on Tuesdays” lecture delivered by Rabbi Daniel Bouskila, Director of Special Projects at the Sephardic Educational Center in Los Angeles. I think that it’s important for everyone to study the Torah with a rabbi whenever possible, and I will be learning from Rabbi Bouskila this semester. Given the erudition and passion on display at Congregation Magen David last Tuesday, it will be time well spent.<br />
Rabbi Bouskila’s free lectures on Jewish interpretations of the great stories in Genesis have the potential to do far more for the promotion of Jews and Judaism than the redundant conferences and lectures on the dangers of radical Islam that somehow manage to capture the attention (and dollars) of many wealthy Jews in this city.<br />
I was happy to learn that all Jewish movements, including Orthodoxy, embrace science. Rabbi Bouskila proudly listed the concepts that his daughter would be studying this year in her biology class at a Modern Orthodox day school, and they included evolution and the scientific method. Jews have always valued learning, both religious and secular. In this they are similar to Mormons, whose church-sponsored universities produce graduates in biology, physics, chemistry and other sciences. <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/jews_and_mormons/item/scriptures_science_and_a_sephardic_rabbi_39101011/">Read the rest here. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a Mormon plea to be part of Shabbat Across America of NJOP</p>
<blockquote><p>Many thanks to fellow LDS-Jewish blogger Christa Woodall for reminding me of the upcoming Shabbat Across America, the annual promotion of Sabbath observance sponsored by the National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP).</p>
<p>To my Jewish readers: please invite an LDS friend or family to accompany you to Sabbath services and to dinner if possible. This is a wonderful opportunity to show them how meaningful Jewish traditions are to you and your family. If you have children, your Mormon friends will have an opportunity to experience a very spiritual moment when you bless them at the table. </p>
<p>To my Mormon readers: if you don’t have a Jewish friend to accompany to services, consult the NJOP’s website to see which area congregations are participating in the program. If you would like to experience a Sabbath dinner, call the synagogue. Often there are families that volunteer to host out-of-town visitors for Sabbath meals, and they may have room for you.  Be sure to arrive in time to see the children blessed. You may want to reciprocate by inviting your Jewish friend to a Monday evening Family Home Evening. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here is our Mormon explaining to his Rabbi friends that he is not a Noahide, rather an Israelite from the tribe of Ephraim. </p>
<blockquote><p>Do rabbis believe that Mormons are Noahides? Rabbis who understand our beliefs would undoubtedly apply that label to observant Mormons and other practicing Christians. However, there are good reasons for Mormons themselves to reject it.</p>
<p>Mormons certainly have no theological objection to any of the Noahide laws…When Mormons are asked by Jews whether they are Noahides, they almost always answer yes.</p>
<p>When asked, I always tell rabbis that I consider myself to be an Israelite, so I can’t be a Noahide. Faithful Mormons are given special blessings (patriarchal blessings) that declare in which Israelite tribe they will receive their spiritual inheritance. The tribe may or may not correspond to their blood lineage, but the tribal designation is very real to Mormons, who strongly believe that they are Latter-day Israelites. My patriarchal blessing goes one step further by informing me that I am a direct descendant of Ephraim, the son of Joseph.<br />
For this reason, I believe that a Mormon who claims to be a Noahide—outside the covenants of Abraham and Moses—is implicitly denying his Israelite identity. <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/jews_and_mormons/item/are_mormons_noahides_brother_i_sure_hope_not_39110124/">Read the rest here.</a></p></blockquote>

				<p>I still have a few more posts on popular culture before I am done with the topic. This tic wont last longer than this month. We will return to Green-Landes debate when I receive the next batch of materials.</p>
<p>In the context of the new book about the relgion of Oprah, there is an older book that keeps figuring int he discussions. <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/excerpt.php?isbn=9780520242807#readtheintroduction">Authentic Fakes<br />
Religion and American Popular Culture</a> by David Chidester</p>
<p>Chidester points out how popular culture lowers the seriousness of the discussion of relgion to tolerable levels. (Some of you remember the RJJ article by Levitt from a few years ago that suggests that the reason for so much talk in shul is to reduce the tension that they dont believe in/appreciate prayer.)<br />
Chidester also notes how much popular culture is based on the body- think of the year in Israel as part of a construction of the body –it is about changes in dress, taste, touch, and movement. How does it serve the pop culture needs of the American students.<br />
One of the important point made by Chidester is the quest for authenticity and how brand new produced objects can take on an aura of authenticity. Certainly, everything done in a gap-year in Israel takes on an air of authenticity. One can teach any new age practice, any metaphysical thinking or tell any homily and by virtue of the situation it becomes authentic.<br />
Even here in the US, what makes the purim videos – authentic? What makes orthodox popular culture as orthodoxy?<br />
And finally, the economic comodification side- what objects are fetishized in Orthoodxy, what serves as a magic object of possession? </p>
<p><em>Religion is serious. According to the great psychologist of religion William James, religion &#8220;signifies always a serious state of mind.&#8221; Popular culture, by contrast, is not serious. Or is it? In this book, I posit that it certainly is. Through the idea of religion, I will engage the compelling political, social, and economic realities of America, at home and abroad, as expressed in American popular culture.</p>
<p>From the most intimate embodiment of personal subjectivity to the most public institutions of social collectivity, what I call religion is at work and at play. It is at work in the disciplines of the body, the regulation of one&#8217;s conduct, and the legitimization of political, social, or economic power. It is at play in the creative improvisations, innovations, transformations, and transgressions of all that serious religious work. Of course, sometimes work can seem like play, so this initial opposition between religious work and religious play will blur.<br />
What difference does it make to call any cultural activity &#8220;religion&#8221;? As we will see, religion can be useful term for understanding the ways in which transcendence, the sacred, and the ultimate are inevitably drawn into doing some very important things that happen in and through popular culture: forming a human community, focusing human desire, and entering into human relations of exchange.</p>
<p>Social cohesion, in forming a sense of community, is reinforced by religious resources. Rising above the everyday course of life, traces of transcendence seem necessary for instilling a sense of continuity with the past. Set apart from the ordinary world, traces of the sacred seem necessary for establishing a sense of uniformity in the present. In the play of popular culture, religious techniques for creating sacred time and sacred space have generated a sense of community within a diverse array of cultural enterprises, such as the church of baseball, the pilgrimage to Graceland, the devotion to Star Trek, and the proliferation of invented religions on the Internet. </p>
<p>Although the notion of the fetish calls attention to an important religious activity—the formation and focusing of human desire</p>
<p>To adopt a phrase coined by the unconventional sociologist Georges Bataille, popular culture celebrates ritualized expenditure in nonproductive economic activity. Not for profit, as Bataille argued, expenditure is economic activity in which the loss must be as great as possible in order to certify a claim on ultimate meaning. Ritual expenditure occurs in a gift, a display, or a performance of wealth. But expenditure also takes place in the waste, the destruction, or the irrecoverable loss of valued objects, including the highly valued &#8220;object&#8221; of human life. In many contexts, such as the performance of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll or the mystery of the global economy, we will see ritual expenditure, in Bataille&#8217;s sense, operating within religion and American popular culture.</p>
<p>the gospel of money by television ministries, which appeal to their viewers for support funding, promising miraculous financial returns to the donors; and even the religious devotion to money in the online Church of the Profit$, which claims to be the only honest, authentic religion in America because it openly admits that it is only in it for the money.<br />
These, then, are three reasons for investigating religion in American popular culture: religious activity is at work in forming community, focusing desire, and facilitating exchange.<br />
Religion and Popular Culture in Embodied, National, and Global Spheres<br />
As a religion of the body, the religion of American popular culture involves the most basic, visceral engagements with the world. Sex, drugs, and the pulsating rhythms of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll embrace the body in an immediacy, an intensity, although the mind and soul might subsequently follow. Mediated through the senses, especially through the physical sense of touch, the embodied character of religion in American popular culture appears in the binding, burning, moving, and handling of religious meaning and power, but it also registers as religion under pressure, as a pervasive sense of anxiety, distraction, and stress in a world that seems to be spinning out of control.</p>
<p>Although I take the human body as the basic ground of religion, it also is important to recognize that much of the creativity of popular culture involves changing or leaving the body. Many ways of modifying the body—piercing and tattooing, plastic surgery and liposuction, cross-dressing and transsexual surgery—have increasingly become part of the American way of life. At the same time, Americans have sought to leave their bodies, flying out of this ordinary world into cyberspace, or virtual reality, unencumbered by the physical pull of planetary gravity or the physical weight of human embodiment. In these efforts, echoes of shamanism, the archaic &#8220;techniques of ecstasy,&#8221; reverberate.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, I confront the problem of authenticity. Although the productions of popular culture might in many ways look, sound, smell, taste, and feel like religion, there is a distinct possibility that they are not actually religious. Baseball is not a religion; Coca-Cola is not a religion; and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll is not a religion. But then all kinds of religious activity have been denied the status of religion, including indigenous religions labeled as superstition and alternative religious movements labeled as cults. What counts as religion, therefore, is the focus of the problem of authenticity in religion and American popular culture. Making the problem worse, some religious activity appears transparently fake, including the proliferation of invented religions on the Internet, but even fake religions can be doing a kind of symbolic, cultural, and religious work that is real.</em></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The French Catholic novelist François Mauriac inspired Elie Wiesel’s Night, specifically the image of the hanged boy as the suffering of God. Mauriac also inspired <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silence-Shusaku-Endo/dp/0800871863">Shusaku Endo</a> to produce a book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_%28novel%29">Silence</a>, about the silence of God before the Japanese sea. He was described by Graham Greene as one of the century&#8217;s greatest writers. If I had to speak this weekend about the tragedy in Japan, I would start here. Camus&#8217;s questions meet religious answers. Let me know if you use it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shusaku Endo was one of Japan&#8217;s great 20th century authors, and like Walker Percy and Graham Greene, he is a Catholic who spent a good portion of his literary life writing about his faith and his struggle with it. As a Catholic, Silence is a book that really makes me think. I don&#8217;t know that Endo provides any answers, but he asks a question that I think most Catholics don&#8217;t want to face. </p>
<p>Endo picks an awesome setting for his question: the period of Christian persecution in Japan in the late 1500s and 1600s, when many Japanese Catholics and European priests were tortured and forced to apostatize. Endo&#8217;s &#8220;silence&#8221; is the silence of God in the face of these awful events. After experiencing one of these events, one of Endo&#8217;s characters writes: I cannot bear the monotonous sound of the dark sea gnawing at the shore. Behind the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of God&#8230;..the feeling that while men raise their voices in anguish God remains with folded arms, silent.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while Endo&#8217;s main character, the priest Sebastian Rodrigues, struggles with this question and his faith, I found the book as a whole to be faith-affirming. Like Miguel de Unamuno&#8217;s San Manuel Bueno, Martir (the story of a priest who doesn&#8217;t believe in the resurrection), the loss of faith equates to a loss of purpose, a loss of strength and a loss of humanity which paints the power of God &#8212; silent though He may be &#8212; much more powerfully than words could ever do. While engaged in the struggle, Rodrigues (and his brother priests and Christians) have a strength to which we gravitate. When they lose their struggle, they become (repeatedly Endo uses this word to such powerful effect): &#8220;servile.&#8221; How ironic. When characters place themselves at the service of God, they are pillars of strength. When they reject their faith-driven duty, they become servile</p>
<p>Endo&#8217;s 1966 novel Silence portrays the visit of a Portuguese Jesuit priest to Japan in the 17th century. In one scene, the priest looks out over a ruined village, and prays: &#8220;The village had been burnt to the ground; and its inhabitants had been completely dispersed. The sea and the land were silent as death; only the dull sound of the waves lapping against the boat broke the silence of the night. Why have you abandoned us so completely? he prayed in a weak voice. Even the village was constructed for you; and have you abandoned it in its ashes? &#8230; Have you just remained silent like the darkness that surrounds me? Why? At least tell me why. We are not strong men like Job who was afflicted with leprosy as a trial. There is a limit to our endurance. Give us no more suffering. So he prayed. But the sea remained cold, and the darkness maintained its stubborn silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scottish composer James Macmillan&#8217;s Symphony No. 3, &#8220;Silence&#8221; is based off of Endo&#8217;s novel. It&#8217;s an incredibly powerful piece of music&#8211;a jarring yet hopeful musical exploration of the &#8220;silence of God in the face of terrible events.&#8221; Here is an excerpt from Macmillan&#8217;s program notes: </p>
<p>&#8220;Endo&#8217;s &#8216;silence&#8217; is the silence of God in the face of terrible events springing from the merciless nature of man: torture, genocide, holocaust. After experiencing one of these events, one of Endo&#8217;s characters writes: &#8216;I cannot bear the monotonous sound of the dark sea gnawing at the shore. Behind the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of God… the feeling that while men raise their voices in anguish, God remains with folded arms, silent.&#8217;</p>
<p>For Endo, though, this silence is not absence but presence. It is the silence of accompaniment rather than &#8220;nihil&#8221;. This is a notion that has many musical analogies. Music itself grows out of silence. The emptiness and solitude of a composer&#8217;s silence is nevertheless pregnant with the promise of possibility and potency.</p>
