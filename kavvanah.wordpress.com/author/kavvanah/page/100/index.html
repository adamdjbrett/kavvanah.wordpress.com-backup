				<p><a href="http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2010/05/midtown_easters_spend_1196_per.html">New York magazine listed</a> how much people spend per month to eat out. The highest rate in the city was singles nightlife Chelsea-Clinton: $754–$2,398. If we look at some neighborhoods with large numbers of Jews, notice the differences:</p>
<p>Upper West Side: $709–$1,056<br />
Williamsburg-Bushwick: $56–$80<br />
Borough Park: $116–$193<br />
East Flatbush–Flatbush: $48–$237<br />
Bronx- Kingsbridge–Riverdale: $300–$444</p>
<p>For comparison purposes it does not matter if the Hasidim or the Hipsters of WIlliamsburg are at the high end becuase either amount is below Boro Park. Do people regulate their eating out based on their religion or does their available income determine their religiosity?  Does eating out as part of one&#8217;s life change one&#8217;s religion? Why does it line up so predictably? What is the correlation of religion and dining out?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Elchanan Shilo’s piece garnered several responses. &#8211; <a href='https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/tgoovot.docx'>teguvot</a><br />
<a href="../../../../2010/06/01/a-continuous-judaism-between-halakhah-and-hiloni-by-elhanan-shilo/index.html">For the original post of Shilo- see here.</a></p>
<p>Rav David Bigman, RaM at Maaleh Gilboa stated his reservations as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>The problem presented in the article is important and the discussion is critical from a personal, religious and national perspectives. The older common halakhah is fading away before smaller individualized forms of halkhah to which people cannot relate. And we have to get beyond the all or nothing approach.</p>
<p>But Bigman completely disagrees with Shilo’s disregard of halakhah and his wanting to change the status of halakhah.<br />
The religious Zionists who live in a wider society have presented  it all or nothing. On the other hand, the totalizing society of Haredim when you observe them first hand don’t actually live according to the halakhah </p>
<p>Our poskim have lost a sense of normal life, work life, army life. They do not relate to the customs by which people arrange their lives and only view things through an ideal halakhic lens.  (Bigman relates a story of yihud in an army situation.) We have lost the distinctions of Biblical law, rabbinic law, minhag yisrael, and custom.  We need to allow different levels. We should not reject the halkhic norms but maybe seek a more intellectual reading of the sources. We need a more living and relevant  halakhah.</p>
<p>We don’t need a new system.   We need the new generation of rabbis who will be relevant. We need to train rabbis to confront the other and appreciate any connection to Judaism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some  letters- praise Shilo. One letter  written by a dat”lash, morid kipah said that he found  the  article just the help for clarifying his life. There was a screed by Dov Landau crediting Shilo with causing all evil in society -supporting the Clash of Civilizations, Post-Modernism, the breakdown of society, and uprooting any and all Torah values. (If he could he would have also credited him with the Asian Tsunami and all disastrous events in Gaza.)</p>
<p>Shilo’s Response to Rabbi Bigman </p>
<blockquote><p>When you enter the halakhah one can soften the law only here and there and even then only a little bit. There is not as much flexibility in the law as you credit.  And that ordinary people cannot wait for new generation of rabbis. Ordinary people work below without waiting for miracles from above.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> PS If you are in Teaneck, ir hakodesh this Shabbat</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Rabbi David Bigman will be at Davar on Shabbat June 4 &amp; 5, 2010<br />

				<p>Two items in the paper of importance to the Jewish-Muslim encounter.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=177302"><strong>Sufi sheikh who preached nonviolence laid to rest</strong></a><br />
By LAUREN GELFOND FELDINGER.</p>
<p>In a small and ancient family plot attached to his ancestral home in Jerusalem’s Old City, <strong>regional Sufi leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz Bukhari</strong> was laid to rest on Tuesday at age 61, after a long struggle with heart disease. He was head of the mystical Naqshabandi Holy Land Sufi Order.</p>
<p>A longtime proponent of nonviolence and interfaith unity, Bukhari found his inspiration in Islamic law and tradition, as well as in the writings of Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. “The stronger one is the one who can absorb the violence and anger from the other and change it to love and understanding. It is not easy; it is a lot of work. But this is the real jihad,” he once told the Globaloneness Project in an interview.</p>
<p>His teachings and practices put him in danger and under great stress that over the years harmed his health, said Sheikh Ghassan Manasra of Nazareth, whose father heads the regional Holy Land Qadari Sufi Order. “Sheikh Bukhari influenced lots of people, worked hard to bridge the religions and cultures; and his teaching is keeping part of the youth on the right path. We worked together for many years and succeeded many times and failed many times and decided to stay on the [path] of God to bring peace, tolerance, harmony and moderation,” he said.</p>
<p>“But on both sides, Jewish and Muslim, there are moderates but also extreme people, and our work was very dangerous, with a lot of pressure and stress until now, and I think this explains, in part, his heart problems.”</p>
<p>Bukhari later also got involved in the Interfaith Coordinating Council in Israel, the Interfaith Encounter Association, and the Sulha Peace Project, and in 2007 launched the “Jerusalem Hug” every June 21, where Israelis, Palestinians and foreigners of all faiths form a human chain of prayer around the Old City.</p>
<p><strong>During Operation Cast Lead, Bukhari initiated a delegation of Arab youth and religious leaders to show solidarity with the students and teachers in Sderot and to share the pain of his own family’s experience in Gaza.<br />
“He was really special,” Rabbi Tzion Cohen, a native of Sderot who is chief rabbi of the Shaar Hanegev region, said of their meeting.<br />
“Despite his own great pain for his family, and despite the fact that some of the group got heated up during the discussion, he and his wife remained gentle and patient and so very kind. I was truly impressed by their pleasantness.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/05/30/2739373/report-us-muslim-jewish-engagement-growing"><strong>Muslim-Jewish engagement is growing in the United States, with the greatest expansion during the past two years, a new report found </strong></a></p>
<p>Even as the political situation in the Middle East continues to heat up, more groups dedicated to Muslim-Jewish education, dialogue and joint social action are being formed, according to the report issued by the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement in Los Angeles, a partnership between Hebrew Union College, Omar Ibn Al Khattab Foundation and the University of Southern California. The data were collected from two surveys conducted in November 2009.</p>
<p>More than 70 percent of these groups have emerged since 9/11. Of those, half were created in the past 24 months. Half of the groups have no staff or budget, demonstrating a heavy reliance on volunteerism. Fifty percent of existing groups raise less than $250 a year, according to the report. </p>
<p>Many of the newest groups emerged from the Weekend of Twinning, a two-year-old project of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding that has brought together more than 200 mosques and synagogues for weekends of joint activity. Seventy percent of the mosques and synagogues that took part in the 2009 weekend say they have developed ongoing relationships.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>New Book on Spirituality- <strong>Courtney Bender, New Metaphysicals</strong>  I have not read it yet, but it is on my list for the summer. </p>
<p>Bender paints spirituality as in process, looking forward, and created in places in do not ordinary consider religion.  Spirituality is created at the intersection of several realms we ordinarily consider secular such as art, health, and vacation.  Spirituality is entangled in daily life and in many relams that we demarcate as special. And it also exists in the house of worship- Spirituality is now offered as yoga classes or healing circles in traditional institutions.</p>
<p>Activities like Yoga can show up as secular, as spiritual and as religious. Journal writing or many forms of healing have that same spectrum. People ask me about Yoga and Judaism and I am beginning to see that the issue is more complex since the same practice can be presented or interpreted in multiple forms and the forms keep changing. </p>
<p>Bender also deals with how spirituality embraces fragments of neuroscience with a theosophical veneer creating an unorthodox science. The practitioners know that it is indeed unorthodox and violating conventional science but they continue to use it .</p>
<p>Bender notes that the new spiritually avoids placing itself in a historical context of the history of American theosophy and New Thought, but it also does not like any analysis of its ideas relative to the sources it works with. She notes that contemporary spirituality does not see itself in the scholarly literature written about it. I certainly find this true. Neo-Hasidism does not see that it is not teaching the original Hasidism anymore not does it want to know the pop-psych and culture -culture that it has let into Hasidism. Kabbalah Centre practitioners assume that all kabblah is a science taught by Moses about getting what you want in life, and kiruv Torah would not see itself in a work comparing it to Evangelicals.  </p>
<blockquote><p>An interview with Courtney Bender<br />
posted by Nathan Schneider<br />
Courtney Bender is an associate professor of sociology at Columbia University. Her latest book, <strong>The New Metaphysicals: Spirituality and the American Religious Imagination </strong>(University of Chicago Press, forthcoming in June), emerged from her research in Cambridge, Massachusetts among people whose “spiritual but not religious” practices and outlooks have been unaccounted for by conventional methods used to identify and study communities of belief.</p>
<p>NS: How do you do scholarship—and, in so doing, take account of history—about a community that denies its own historicity? I was struck by your claim that “the puzzle of spirituality in America cannot be solved by locating it in a history it refuses.”</p>
<p>CB: But what is puzzling about spirituality is that, even as the number of monographs on the topic grows, these histories don’t seem to resonate with contemporary people who call themselves spiritual, or with most scholars who look at its present manifestations. One reason for this is that the living practices of spirituality allow people to cultivate ways of being in time that are future-focused, or that situate practitioners in perennial time. All religious practices place people in time and in space. In this case, the spiritual practices that I trace do interesting things to the kind of narrative history that most historians write, so paying attention to these practices, and chronicling how they unravel and decouple from most recognizable historical narratives, is just as important. That’s what I have tried to do.<br />
Looking at all of this, I embraced a study of entanglements because it demands different starting points for analyzing religious life: experience, discourse, meaning, and practice. We can ask how religious practices are produced or carried in secular contexts, and we can think about how to conduct research on religion in those settings in ways that do not presume that everything is sacralized, but that recognize that things are often a bit more complicated than we have made them out to be—I’d say a bit more interesting too.</p>
<p>NS: If not in such traditional, formal contexts, where does one find the markers of spirituality?<br />
CB: Well, first I should say that we do indeed find markers of spirituality in traditional religious institutions. In an early chapter, I focus on a variety of sites in Cambridge where spirituality is produced: alternative medicine, the arts (particularly amateur arts), and also various religious groups. There is a lot of interaction among these.</p>
<p>But in The New Metaphysicals, I followed a number of practices that are sometimes spiritual, sometimes religious, and sometimes secular. Yoga is one, but a more intriguing case, and a favorite of mine, is the transformation of medium- and spirit-writing, and automatic writing (popular in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Spiritualist circles), to “flow writing” and cathartic writing. An even more intriguing practice that sits at the core of the book is the emergence of “religious experience”—which is taken up in legal and psychological literature, then carried and reproduced in secular discourse about the self and private belief. In other words, these practices are not firmly or primarily located within “religion” or “science” or “health” or “artistry.”  Part of their power for my respondents is in the ways that their multiple locations, and multiple linked sites of reproduction, add to the sensation that they are “everywhere” and universal.</p>
<p>Yes, some of their ideas are often uncritical mixtures of nineteenth-century Theosophical ideas, what they learned from any number of alternative health practitioners, and whatever David Brooks says about neuroscience in his New York Times column. But most Americans hold some combination of ideas about science that include heavy doses of misunderstanding, rumor, hope, and imagination.</p>
<p>NS: For many religious Americans, though, sins against science come rooted in suspicion and omission. Those in your book seem prone, instead, to an overzealous embrace.<br />
CB: Perhaps it would be fair to say that the people I met in Cambridge are aware of the fact that they are drawing on unorthodox combinations of science, religion, and philosophy—probably more so than many others. The unorthodoxy of their expectations about science’s possibilities, and its relation to the character and quality of the universe as a metaphysical whole, makes them more aware than others that the science they think about is an imagined one. That said, the great majority of them also insisted that their views would some day be vindicated. As they see it, true spiritual laws never change, and given their universality and generalizability, they will someday—soon—capture the attention of mainstream physicists and neuroscientists. </p>
<p>NS: In particular, do you mean to offer a critique, as sociological accounts of American metaphysical spirituality often have in the past?<br />
CB: Offering a critique is not what gets me out of bed in the morning, to be honest. </p></blockquote>

				<p>Isaiah Tishby.  <strong>Messianic Mysticism: Moses Hayim Luzzatto and the Padua School.</strong> Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2008.  $69.50 </p>
<p>These studies were written by Tishby in the 1970&#8217;s and 1980&#8217;s and they are only now available English. They portray the clean-shaven unmarried Luzzatto who wrote plays in Italian and Latin, and who gathered a group of University of Padua medical students around him for the purposes of creating a mystical circle. Tishby explores the messianism, the Sabbatianism, Luzzatto&#8217;s angelic maggid, his messiah ketubah, and the heresy accusations. These are studies on recently discovered manuscripts not final thoughts, many of these topics can use further elucidation after the thirty years.We now have many more works by Luzzatto. For example he shows us the reader that Luzzatto used his ruah hakodesh to write a new Zohar but Tishby does not explore the content of the work nor its relationship to the extensive writings of Valle.  An intellectual biography of Luzzatto remains a desideratum.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Isaiah Tishby.  Messianic Mysticism: Moses Hayim Luzzatto and the<br />
Padua School.<a href="http:///www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3D23866"> Reviewed by Hartley Lachter</a> (Muhlenberg College)</p>
<p>Moses Hayim Luzzatto (1707-46) was undoubtedly one of the most important thinkers and fascinating personalities of<br />
eighteenth-century Italian Jewry. The scion of an influential Jewish family in Padua, Luzzatto&#8217;s life and literary legacy project a<br />
distinctly contradictory set of images. At once a poet, playwright, moralist, kabbalist, self-fashioned leader of a messianic group,<br />
radical prophet, and exiled accused heretic, Luzzatto nonetheless came to be celebrated by Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, as well as<br />
secular Jews of later generations</p>
<p>Many of the compositions by Luzzatto that Tishby addresses in this volume would be quite surprising to one familiar with Luzzatto&#8217;s more popular writing. Included here are a number of previously unknown works that Tishby discovered in MS<br />
Oxford 2593, as well as poetry (reproduced in both Hebrew and English), and several prayers that Luzzatto composed for a variety of<br />
occasions, including a confessional prayer that he wrote for his group of kabbalists in Padua. Tishby also gives attention to the<br />
works of Moses David Valle (a significant member of Luzzato&#8217;s kabbalistic group), reproducing his mystical diary, rife with<br />
messianic overtones, and he explores the question of the spread of Luzzatto&#8217;s works in Eastern Europe, and their influence on Hasidic<br />
schools of thought.</p>
<p>One of the most striking compositions discussed in this collection of studies is the kabbalistic commentary that Luzzatto wrote to his own marriage contract when he married Zipporah, the daughter of Rabbi David Finzi of Mantua, in 1731. This remarkable text, as noted in Dan&#8217;s introduction, sheds important light on Luzzatto&#8217;s messianic posture. Luzzatto came to be regarded with suspicion when he began claiming as early as 1727 that he was receiving revelations of a maggid or heavenly voice, enabling him to compose prophetic pronouncements, and even a &#8220;new Zohar,&#8221; which it seems he shared with the group of kabbalists that he led in Padua. Added to this was the  accusation leveled by Moses Hagiz before the rabbis of Venice that he intercepted a letter by a member of Luzzatto&#8217;s group containing evidence that Luzzatto was a follower of Shabbtai Zvi. </p>
<p>Luzzatto&#8217;s teacher and champion, Isaiah Bassan, convinced him that he could quell at least some of the controversy if he would agree to marry, since remaining single into one&#8217;s mid-twenties was itself understood to be unseemly. The discovery of Luzzatto&#8217;s kabbalistic commentary to his own marriage contract reveals that while his decision to marry was in part a concession intended to placate his critics, the marriage was also understood by Luzzatto as a union of divine dimensions, literally heralding the messianic era. Situating this document within the broader context of Luzzatto&#8217;s messianic doctrine, Tishby concludes that Luzzatto regarded himself as serving the role of Moses, whose task is to guide the actions of the Messiah son of Joseph and the Messiah son of David. Evidence indicates, according to Tishby, that Luzzatto understood Valle to be the Messiah son of David, while none other than Zvi was regarded as the Messiah son of Joseph.  Another of Luzzatto&#8217;s group, Jekutiel of Vilna, was believed to serve as Seraiah of the tribe of Dan, the general of the forces of the messianic army. Luzzatto&#8217;s commentary to his marriage contract is reproduced in full English translation in the volume, along with Tishby&#8217;s illuminating notes. Taken together with Valle&#8217;s diary, these texts provide important source material for an under appreciated moment of messianic ferment.</p>
<p>We know that Luzzatto received an education in non-Jewish areas of knowledge, and he even defended his colleague Jekutiel from detractors who took issue with his study of &#8220;Gentile wisdom,&#8221; since he came to Padua originally to study medicine. How are we to understand these otherwise &#8220;worldly&#8221; men in their turn toward Jewish esoteric discourse as the source for all true knowledge? </p>
<p>As Luzzatto remarks in a text addressing Jeremiah 9:22, &#8220;Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,&#8221; found in MS Oxford 2593, &#8220;the whole science of truth [kabbalah] rests solely on this question, the question of the holiness of Israel: how the Holy One, blessed be He, adheres to them in His holiness and how Israel must adhere, through their desire and their worship, to His holiness, blessed be He; and how all the affairs of the world and of the all creation have rested upon this basis ever since they came into existence and [will do so] to all eternity&#8221; (p. 47). </p>
<p>There remains work to be done in better situating Luzzatto and his colleagues within the eighteenth-century Italian intellectual context. </p></blockquote>
<p>As a companion, I recommend Rivka Schatz-Uffenheimer, “Moshe Hayim Luzzatto&#8217;s thought against the background of theodicy literature,” in Justice and Righteousness (1992) 173-199 where she contextualizes Ramhal in the post Lisbon eathquake concerns of Leibnitz and King.</p>
<p>This baroque world of science and kabbalah intertwined ended abruptly with the Enlightenment. From Rav Yosef Karo to Ramhal and from there to the Vilna Gaon, a proper Gadol could ascend to heaven, perform kavvanot, receive angelic visitors, and attempt to bring the messiah. Forty years after these writings Ramhal&#8217;s own cousin Shadal would not suffer to perform any of these kabbalistic rites or utter kabbalistic prayers. Enlightenment concern with sense data and manuscript work on texts had brought the baroque edifice down. </p>
<p>Ramhal played almost no part in Gershom Scholem&#8217;s writings since Luzzatto treated kabbalah as either scientific or as theological providence,not as symbolism</p>
<p>In the 21st century, these remain as vestiges for the psychologist to decipher what to tell the client. There is a local psychiatrist that wants to work with me on some schema for understanding the Orthodox kids who come in with angelic visitors, when are they potential gadolim (or at least mathematicians and chess masters) and when do they need medication? But the real question is can we accept the epistemic rupture that the early modern period represents and the fact that we exists in a alternate formulation of Judaism. The Vilna Gaon with his angelic visitors belonged to Luzzatto&#8217;s world, the world of tikkunim.  </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Here is an article By Elchanan Shilo, “A Continuous Judaism between halakhah and Hiloni” that appeared in the Shabbat Supplement of  Mekor Rishon on  May 7 2010 <a href="http://www.tzavpius.org.il/node/413">and it has been posted on Tzav Pius</a> (One of the many inscrutable projects of the Avi  Chai Foundation.)<br />
It is an interesting article and brings together many ideas currently floating around. Yet, I am not sure if he is not just recreating 1920’s Conservative Judaism  or a European Geminde system. Nor am I sure that all the parts of his argument work together. Shilo, who teaches Jewish thought, wants to undo the division between those who keep halakhah and those who pick and choose. <strong>He brings together those who are halakhic, with those who pick and choose, and he includes in his expanded approach both those who only occasionally find something that speaks to them in Judaism and those leaving halakhic oservance.</strong> Here is a freehand summary and paraphrase of selected lines and an even more freehand translation of key lines.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A Continuous Judaism Between Halakhah and Hiloni by Elchanan Shilo</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The time has come to stop building bridges between the religious and the secular and instead to create a new wider existence.</strong> The religious Zionist community, whose strength is enough for both sides, is capable of building this expanse in order to break the divisions of the past.”</p>
<p>Modernity brought (1)education (2)a bourgeois life (3) a halakhicification of Judaism.The first two are good. But the later creates a division between religious and secular. The division was originally encouraged for the pride of building an educated community who knew and kept halakhah. <strong>Now we need to erase the divide by mixed schools and individualized patterns of observance.</strong></p>
<p>We already have many people who have individualized approaches.  Some people find halakhah and the religious life stifling and not life enhancing , others find it fits perfectly and enhances their lives. Generally we are happy when people discover observance but we should understand that it does not fit everyone and we should accept that people regularly give up observance. People go back and forth. <strong>His solution is to prevent absolute secularization- and see the community as a very wide range of observances with people going both directions at all times. </strong> In this approach, the formerly frum (Datla”sh) who don’t fit into the secular world would remain comfortably part of religious world. (Datla”sh is at least 25 % of the religious Zionist community)</p>
<p>Shilo argues that his approach should not be confused with the liberalism of Reform and Conservative.  The later movements judged Orthodoxy as primitive and that they are progressive. They created a new ideology with justifications for none observance. Shilo wants a broad tent without any judgment or ideology. </p>
<p>He accepts the older American model of having a men’s section, a women’s section, and mixed section. No judging and no definite answer. Some people follow the halakhah and some people follow their need not to have a mehitza. {He emailed me to tell me that he thought these mixed pulpits still existed in the US. His American father remembers them. He did not know that they dont exist anymore.}</p>
<p>Liberal religious Zionist weddings have mixed dancing after the officials leave combining both halkhah and actual practice. But he asks why not has both separate and mixed dancing right from the start? Halakhah without ideology or non-observance of Halakhah without ideology wont topple the edifice. </p>
<p>There are no hard definitions of God’s will only soft ones that vary with the individual. <strong>Shilo advocates that we should turn to the writings of Rabbi Mordechai Leiner of Izbitz, the Mei Hashiloah.</strong> People can have different callings from God, some in the halakhah and some not in the halkhah. How do we know that God wants everyone to keep halakhah, maybe sometimes there is intentional sin for the sake of heaven or different paths for different people. </p>
<p>We don’t want to delegitimize Jews or close options. He advocates a practical Judaism or an actual Judaism or a realistic Judaism. <strong>Many people want to keep Shabbat and even love Shabbat but are not interested in the details of squeezing, mixing, or smoothing on the Sabbath</strong> Many just want to keep up the tradition or the family values.</p>
<p>A different case is that people can like Shabbat but also have normal sexual needs . They do not want to be told that it is the evil inclination, rather they want to enjoy sexuality and the Sabbath. They don’t want a dichotomy of either being part of the frum world or the secular world.<br />
Not keeping hair covering, going mixed swimming, and mixed dancing can be done without any ideology of either rejecting Orthodoxy or  forcing people into a social ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>The beit midrash should be open to all. And the criteria for how to study and what to study is not determined by halakhah but by relevance, interest, meaning  and poetics.</strong></p>
<p>People don’t want a Reform Shabbat in the synagogue they want a traditional Shabbat that they can mold to their own meaning.<br />
Halakhah has to stop fighting a radical secularism and secularist have got to stop fighting the halkahic world. A wide practical Jewish life can bring people together.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>OK, so is this new or old? Feasible or not? Are all details worked out or are their dangling elements. Read the full Hebrew article and let me know if there is something that will catch on here or is it just a idea.</strong></p>

				<p>New study described by Sightings &#8211; Faith based social services dont change actual congregation but operate independently of congregations. However, they do not operate independently of governmental services, they are grafted into them. There are actually not that many people that care for people for free except in time of emergency and they all rely on government funds.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Faith-based Initiative and Congregational Change&#8211; Martin E. Marty</p>
<p> “Did the Faith-based Initiative Change Congregations?” asked astute sociologists of religion Bob Wineberg and Mark Chaves last April.  The answer:  No.  Chaves, based at Duke University, follows up with a revision in The Christian Century (June 1), “Congregations Say No to the Faith-based Initiative: Thanks, but No Thanks.”  He is referring to the Congress-launched program to tap the energies and genius of religious organizations, “including congregations, to meet social needs.”  Recognizing that the program had been controversial from the first, often on grounds coded as “church-state relations,” Chaves analyzed follow-up studies to see whether the tapping had been productive.  Again:  No.</p>
<p>  Chaves is anything but an anti-institutional, anti-congregational muckraker, doomsayer, or secular snob.  His career is devoted to assessing what role crucial institutions like congregations (parishes, mosques, synagogue) can and do achieve.  We can picture him having hoped that this innovation would work.  “Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services and Jewish Family Services” do work big time, he notes.  It’s hard to imagine American voluntary life without such large agencies, something the “spiritual but not religious” or “religious but non-institutional” citizens don’t often notice.  But, once more, “did the faith-based initiative have any impact on congregations?  Did it prompt congregations to get more involved in providing social services?”  Again, No! and No!</p>
<p>Failure followed because those in charge worked with false assumptions.  One was “that congregation-based social services represent an alternative to the social welfare system.”  No, they don’t.  Chaves:  “The reality is that there is no such alternative system in the religious world.”  Congregations are not an alternative; their social services depend on “the current system.”  “It is much more common for a congregation to plug into an existing program than to start a new one.”   False assumption two:  that “congregations represent a vast reservoir of volunteer labor.”  Do they?  No.  Most congregations are small, internally diverse, peopled by believers who can’t all be mobilized to serve.  </p>
