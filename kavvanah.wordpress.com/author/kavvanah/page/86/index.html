				<p>Even academics must eventually return books to the library. I have had out for several years the following title and the library wants it back. </p>
<p>Andrew Beaujon , <strong>Body piercing saved my life: inside the phenomenon of Christian rock</strong> Da Capo Press (2006)<br />
As a rock critic his goal was to review Christian rock, but as a non-fiction author he sought to explain the paradox or tension between the amoral world of rock and the Christian version of it. </p>
<p>From The Blurb</p>
<blockquote><p>A look at some of the colorful figures who have transformed the Christian rock scene into a flourishing industry. A non-Christian, but a devoted fan of music and a senior contributing writer for Spin..Never condescending to his subjects, the author appears to hold a genuine curiosity as to what makes Christian rockers tick, and they in turn welcome his deliberately naive inquiries, making for a refreshingly unbiased view of a subject that many jaded journalists would find easy to mock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the world of Christian rock is connected to anti-religious rock more than the average person, yet the believers see themselves as more pure than those Christians who are religious but listen to ordinary music. What does it mean to situate one’s religion in the raunchiest part of culture? He describes a culture that is indebted to MTV and the internet,  cheers for red meat, and has pop culture references to Hooters, Paris Hilton and  reality TV. Preachers learn their sermon timing from stand –up comediennes like Eddie Murphy. How is this Christian?</p>
<p>The parallel to the Christian rock youth movements are the kiruv organizations that based culturally on videos, songs, pop-culture- offer trips to Great Adventure- offer classes in drumming and karate- and offer much of the same raunchiness.  Torah study and mizvot are not the focus, rather personal states like commitment, belief, and acceptance of Torah as a reedom from doubt.</p>
<p>Andrew Beaujon  in his interview finds that the preachers of rock declare:  “We preach in an un-Christian place,” America is a non-religious country. The youth care about culture, music, TV and “we need to be conversant.”  He finds an implicit dualism &#8211;“the world” is part for one’s religious life and one need to put the world aside. The world is sin and temptation. Second, there is the dualism in each person. People have a sinful nature, so we have to wean them away from it.<br />
How much of kiruv reconnection to Judaism is weaning them away from the evil outside world? And how much is a support group knowing that people sin and need to group support of a shabbaton not to sin? What is the anthropology of outreach? </p>
<p>In addition, is it related to the mainstream? To be technical for a moment,  Durkheim distinguishes between group and grid organization. In group organization, the religious moment is the separation from the non-religious world-the impure. Group identity is formed by excluding things. Grid organization is the hierarchal arrangement based on knowledge and observance. The religious goals for a grid arrangement are the aspirations of making oneself  a scholar or scrupulous within one’s community. If people are lax within a grid community, then one needs for them to re-ascend the grid through Torah study and scrupulousness.  Blaming the outside world would not work for a slid down the grid. In contrast, youth movement kiruv is about group identify and conveying a sense of difference from the outside? For Durkheim,  group activities like discussing pop-culture or enthusiasm does not and cannot lead to grid strictness in observance. </p>
<p>Beaujon points out that personal testimonies are the secret currency of evangelicalism” Should we use hip-hop? Answer &#8212; Can and did it save anyone? One can use anything no matter how raunchy if you think it will lead to commitment. What are the criteria for integrating pop-culture into Kiruv? How do we know hip-hop is good to use? It works.<br />
Christian rock preaches not to curse, but Beaujon notes that some of the successful preachers curse for shock value. The preacher shows he is cool by doing it. It somehow teaches that even though one has rejected pop culture, yet one is still part of it. Needless to say, mainstream preachers neither have to tell their congregants not to swear like a rapper, nor would they even violate it to be cool. Christian Rock is a religiosity situated in the simultaneous acceptance and rejection of pop-culture.</p>
<p>Beaujon  deal with the case of second generation Evangelical kids. They say they have been saved and gained much through Christian rock even though they were already raised in a religious home and have done little tangible in the year to repent or change their ways. They don’t have more of any criteria of observance or attendance. Beaujon claims that since the second generation  does not really want more demands for alteration of behavior, therefore those raised in religious homes have anger and resentment because they cannot get the euphoria and freedom from doubt. (They are lots of Jewish parallels here).</p>
<p>In the world of Christian rock, they preach abstinence by talking about sex often and decrying the immoral sex on TV.  (Compare the endless Jewish sessions on negiah.) When it comes to statistics, those attracted to Evangelical chastity have the highest unwed mother rate (think Bristol Palin).  The lowest rate are those studious types who prefer science fairs and are working to get into competitive programs.  (On the Jewish side, getting someone turned onto serious learning (or math team) changes his life more than decrying secular values.)</p>
<p>Beaujon compares Christian Rock to jam bands. The attraction is not the artistry but the ability to tap into a sense of freedom and adventure. They have a sense of swagger, the fun of winging it,   heartfelt muddled beliefs and the promise of self-guided education. Beaujon thinks that  Americans try on identities and they need maps to navigate the muddledness of life. Christain music offers a chance to try on identities and boundaries. </p>
<p>Bono who is always speaking about his Christian faith  is not the model. Beaujon points out, U2 are banned  because of their &#8220;doubting&#8221; lyrics &#8211; and Bono&#8217;s criticism of grasping American tele-evangelists. Though they will play cover versions of their songs. </p>
<p>The mainstream Evangelical magazine <a href="http:///www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/juneweb-only/124-42.0.html">Christianity Today</a> published a review of the book in which the author wanted not to like Christian rock since it does not adhere to the mainstream straight world of the heartland church. They don’t want believers with spike wristbands. The magazine questions the very religiosity of the bands and these preachers. If you spend all your time in the music world, then you may be more non-Christian than you think. (Think of what a mainstream rabbi would say about a kiruv jam band.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Show me an evangelical between the ages of 15 and 50, and I&#8217;ll show you an evangelical who can tell this story (or something much like it): I used to listen to secular music, then I discarded it all and listened only to Christian music. Then I realized I didn&#8217;t like much Christian music, so I slowly started listening to secular music again<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take Beaujon long to note Christian rock&#8217;s tortured existence. Not only does the audience choose it as an oft-reluctant alternative to mainstream music, but many Christian musicians are themselves forever sorting out their own relationship to the non-Christian artists they esteem, the non-Christian listeners they covet, and the non-Christian labels with whom they&#8217;d like to sign.<br />
At the Pedro show at Cornerstone, the central question—for Beaujon and the thousands of packed-in teenagers, if not for Bazan—is whether Bazan will flaunt the festival&#8217;s unwritten ban against curse words and include his lyrical f-bombs. He does, the audience squeals, and Beaujon marvels at how evangelical kids can love someone who has rejected their culture:<br />
Which raises a question, one that Beaujon&#8217;s project and the entire Christian music industry begs: What makes music Christian? Is it the mission statement of the labels? The theological content of the lyrics? The faith of the musicians or producers? The faith of the listeners? The profit margins devoted to the poor? Surely none of the above, for all exist on a sliding scale&#8230;.<br />
Well—here&#8217;s a fool&#8217;s axiom: Both inside the parallel universe of Christian music and in every other universe, the only one who can make music Christian is Christ</p></blockquote>
<p>Substitute the word Torah in the last sentence. Mission, outreach, faith, dedication, commitment are all second to Torah.</p>
<p>The book also opens up the question of the quality of religious culture. We tend not to have a  frame of reference for judging religious art or thought. We accept kitch and don’t compare them to the broader world. In this Beaujon is indebted to the 1981 classic by Franky Schaffer, <strong>Addicted to Mediocrity: Contemporary Christians and the Art</strong>. In this work, Schaffer asked: we don’t hire builders, accountants, or doctors just because they are Christian, so why do we do this in art and thought? (No shortage of Jewish parallels.)</p>
<p>My interest here is how culture and relgion interact, specifically the rle of pop culture in Judaism. I am not overly interested in discussing kiruv.</p>
<p>Attn Wingnuts: This is not an attack on Kiruv. And there are many different organizations and changes over time, therefore I dont need your story globalized. I did not give Jewish specifics because my emphasis was on Beaujon.</p>

				<p>The prolific author Avi Sagi has an article on prayer. Sagi&#8217;s prior work was to create a pluralistic traditionalism of an open canon, non-metaphysical positions based on Wittgenstein, Leibowitz and Goldman, and more recently to propose a Gadamer reading of the tradition. For our prior discussions on Sagi, see <a href="../../../../2009/10/12/avi-sagi-tradition-vs-traditionalism/index.html">here</a> and <a href="../../../../2009/10/09/gadamer-on-orthodoxy-tradition-as-self-identity/index.html">here.</a><br />
In the last issue of Reshit, Avi Sagi has a long article “Casualties of Worship: Tefilah after the death of God- a Phenomenological Inquiry into Hebrew Literature.” The article is selected pages from a forthcoming book on the topic. <a href="http://reshit.hartman.org.il/Article_View_Heb.asp?Article_Id=24">Html- here</a> and <a href="http://reshit.hartman.org.il/uploads/Articles/10_Reshit2-30082010_1001_10.pdf">pdf &#8211; here</a></p>
<p>Sagi wants to return us to prayer in our post-secular age through a sensitive reading of Israeli poetry- connecting the themes of secular Israeli poets to those of Rav Nahman and Rav Kook. The overall effect is his advocating prayer as a personal act in which people express existential themes. Even though he is footnoted only once, the project seems to continue the work of Eliezer Schweid in seeking to create an Israeli Jewish culture.</p>
<p>Sagi argues that prayer after the death of God and expressing one’s disbelief  is still in front of God; it is still a religious act. It is not atheist or theist, rather a presence and then absence. Sagi rejects those who seek dialogue and connection with God. Buber wanted I-Thou presence as did William James and A J Heschel. Sagi claims that these experiential approaches have no real transcendental available. Prayer in Sagi’s reading is about the self. It is about the human subject.   Sagi offers us the Kierkegaard’s struggle, Camus acceptance of fate, and Feuerbach’s prayer as the alter ego of the person.</p>
<p>From this modernist idealistic and existential base, Sagi analyzes a broad spectrum of Israeli writers most of whom were formed in the early part of the twentieth century including Yizhak Lamdan, Abba Kovnor, Uri Zvi Greenberg, Sim Shalom, Brenner, and Amir Gilboa.  This book will offer the Israeli high school teacher a way of re-tooling for an era when there is less of a religious –secular divide. Everyone is now existential religious. The early poems of Amichai are not read as sardonic or cynical, rather as noble and religious. Amir Gilboa whom once upon a time was considered by critics as too exilic, too Jewish, and too metaphysical, and not secular, rebellious, or expressive enough—is used by Sagi to transition into the very human prayers of Rav Nachman and Rav Kook. Gilboa is associated with the secular in order to show how close they are to the religious.  </p>
<p>Israeli poems of recent vintage are not discussed, even though they would lead to a different direction, for example there is no discussion of the generation of Binyamin Shevili, Ella Bat Zion, or Rifka Miriam. This work rests in classic modernism. The work is also entirely a cognitive discussion, more would have been gained by looking at how contemporary religious poets look at the issues, for example through the important journal <a href="http://imagejournal.org/">IMAGE:Art, Faith and Mystery.</a>  </p>
<p>In the 19th century, Prayer even without God changes a person declared Kierkegaard, prayer as a projection of the ego is the essence of religion decided Feuerbach. Sagi returns to find the pieces of modern Jewish thought on prayer that speak to this approach, such as Franz Rosenzweig’s – expressive and emotive prayer and Wiesel’s prayer at God instead of to God. Sagi manages to even glide Rav Nachman into considering prayer as the modernist action since “ Every blame of grass has a prayer”- so it is not expressive or faith but an action. Sagi finds that the common principle to modern prayer as self-expression and traditional prayer is their depth structure. He proves this by quoting rabbi S R Hirsch that the essence of prayer is self-judgment. So we prove tradition and modernity coincide by showing that a cultured 19th century Wiemar romantic rabbi just so happens to sound like early 20th century Hebrew poets. </p>
<p>Religious moderns used to ask about the efficacy of prayer, and they used to answer using shards of Albo that prayer is a self-fulfilling statement, personal transformation, and acceptance that God’s will be done.  This is true whether they framed prayer as a gift from God or as a human obligation. Philosophy of relgion deal with the coherence of prayer in the modern age but for Sagi the real question is what model of prayer?</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sagi offers us an alternate model that “Prayer is not the inheritance of religion, on the contrary the religious ritual of prayer …is one of the expressions of human existence. We now have a modernist prayer without belief. Prayer is about fate, existence, and the questions of life. God’s death is a moment in our demythologized human narrative.  Sagi has officially crossed the line into liberal theology reminiscent of Bultmann. </p>
<p>From my American perch,  Sagi is attempting to create a minimal deity far from the theism that people cannot believe anymore, akin to discussions of prayer in Arthur Green and Elie Wiesel. Sagi can also be compared to the discussion in <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/books/37749/unorthodox-theology/">Adam Kirsch’s review Unorthodox Theology</a> about “an anthology of liberal Jewish thought evinces a deep unease with traditional conceptions of God.” Kirsch continues his summary: “God, in these pages, is not a being to be described but a process to be experienced. As Kalmanofsky puts it, “Theology is discourse about God. Religion is the human, social response to transcendence; systems of ideas, tales, and behaviors that help us keep faith with our deepest spiritual experiences.”</p>
<p>The weak part of the presentation is that Sagi still does not understand the turn away from self in a post-Heidegger, Levinas, and Derrida world. Yet, he wants to be part of this post-modern discourse. Sagi wants desperately to offer a phenomenology based on Jean Luc Marion in which Sagi&#8217;s modernist prayer of self-expression and in which God does not appear is equated with the God beyond self, a Given, in the Marion sense. However, the given for  Marion &#8220;is famous for the idea of what he calls the “saturated phenomenon,” which is inspired by his study of Christian Neoplatonic mystical theologians&#8230;.[The idea that] there are phenomena of such overwhelming givenness or overflowing fulfillment that the intentional acts aimed at these phenomena are overrun, flooded—or saturated.&#8221; Sagi’s phenomena of prayer never overcomes the self or has a givenness of God that overruns our theological categories.  Sagi should <a href="../../../../2010/09/26/post-modern-religion-the-syllabi-of-john-caputo/index.html">listen to Caputo’s classes</a> or read <a href="../../../../2010/08/26/richard-kearney-anatheism-returning-to-god-after-god/index.html">Richard Kierney, in which God returns after God- a disorientation that we learn to welcome</a>.</p>
<p>Depending how the book is edited, it may become a classic for Israeli high schools and an entrance for Americans into Hebrew poetry as a religious quest. The approach will definitely not excite the new generation of spirituality, meditation, and new age. It probably has drifted too far afield for use in the religious community. But it is still nice to have a humanistic approach to Jewish prayer, that should find many an eager reader. If there is time to still work on the manuscript, I would suggest a greater emphasis on questions than answers and a coda of some of the recent thinking about poetry and religion found in the journal IMAGE.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://imagejournal.org/page/blog/is-poetry-prayer">From IMAGE</a><br />
Garcia Lorca once said, ‘we need four white walls and a silence where the poet’s voice can weep and sing.’ One enters that space with the hope that, through the making of language, the making of poems—poesis, after all, means making—one will be taken away, one will go where one hasn’t been before. We hope to be possessed.”</p>
<p>More recently, writing in Image #49, Robert Cording sounds a similar note. “Both poetry and prayer acknowledge the limits of the ego. In this sense, their origins are rooted in invocation—a calling out to that which cannot be seen or logically understood and which ultimately cannot be put into language. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK- go read the review and come back to discuss.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There is a new book by Robert D. Putnam and David E. Campbell  called <strong>AMERICAN GRACE: How Religion Divides and Unites Us</strong> 673 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $30. The book is not earth shattering but it will be standard work that needs to be footnoted and it will be the accepted starting point for discussions. </p>
<p>Putnam whose prior work  <strong>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</strong> – showed the breakdown of social networks in the United States. We don’t have bowling leagues, Moose lodges, synagogue men’s clubs, or continuous community activities compared to prior decades. (Anyone dealing with the rise of the new online social networks would need to use this as a base.)</p>
<p>In this new book, Putnam together with Campbell argue that we went from the loss of the religion in the 1960’s, the return in the 1980’s, and then the reaction against the repressiveness in the late 1990’s by people claiming to be atheist or post-evangelical. None of this is new to readers of this blog.  </p>
<p>Second, They show that increase in social contact with any group leads to an acceptance into one’s social network. Evangelicals, Catholics, and Jews each now accept each other and assume the others are all going to heaven. </p>
<p>Along the way they gather much of the tidbits about religious life in the US we know from the various surveys. Jews are the most accepted of any group and that most people are both somewhat feminist and religious. (The ADL fleeced American Jewry out of 54 million last year by arguing for the virulent Antisemitism everywhere..) I have included various citations from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Wright-t.html">NYT review </a>and <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=changing_faiths">the review by Peter Steinfels. </a></p>
<p>There are may other reviews out there but I have also included an interview with Putnam by Albert Mohler the conservative Baptist. It is interesting to show how a conservative Evangelical deals with social science data, especially the fact that his own positions have driven people away. This is interesting because Centrist orthodoxy does not usually allow social data to interfere with ideology.</p>
<blockquote><p>America has experienced three seismic shocks, say Robert Putnam and David Campbell. In the 1960s religious observance plummeted.  Then, in the 1970s and 1980s a conservative reaction produced the rise of evangelicalism and the Religious Right.  Since the 1990s, however, young people, turned off by that linkage between faith and conservative politics, have abandoned organized religion entirely.  The result:  growing polarization.</p>
<p>That reaction to &#8220;the long Sixties&#8221; has been extensively analyzed. Less so the second great aftershock, the rise of the &#8220;nones&#8221; after 1990 when young people, in particular, began rejecting identification with any religion, though not necessarily with a variety of religious beliefs and practices. More and more young Americans, according to polls, came to view religion as &#8220;judgmental, homophobic, hypocritical, and too political,&#8221; overly focused on rules rather than spirituality. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Richter rating of this second aftershock is greater than that of the first aftershock and rivals that of the powerful original quake of the Sixties,&#8221; Putnam and Campbell write.<br />
Putnam and Campbell write, “By the 2000s, how religious a person is had become more important as a political dividing line than which denomination he or she belonged to.”</p>
<p>Here the authors explain the observation they started the book with: America’s religious diversity hasn’t generally involved much intolerance. Indeed, believers seem willing to bend basic doctrines in the name of interfaith amity. Most Christians, even most evangelical Christians, ¬believe that non-Christians can go to heaven, notwithstanding the New Testament’s repeated assertions that Christ is the only path to the Kingdom of God. </p>
<p>The authors’ explanation for this bigheartedness is common-sensical: “Most Americans are intimately acquainted with people of other faiths.” Americans have, on average, at least two friends who don’t share their faith, and at least one ¬extended-family member who fits that description. And who wants to tell friends or relatives that they’re going to hell — or even believe that a friend or relative is going to hell? More broadly: getting to know an adherent of an otherwise alien faith tends to humanize the aliens. </p>
<p>They conducted surveys with the same large pool of people in consecutive years and tracked changes in both social milieus and attitudes. They conclude, for instance, that gaining an evangelical friend leads to a warmer assessment of evangelicals — by seven degrees on a “feeling thermometer,” to be exact — and gaining a non¬religious friend brings four degrees of added warmth toward the nonreligious.</p>
<p><strong>“Most Americans today are religious feminists.”<br />
Jews are the most broadly popular religious group in America today.</p>
<p>A whopping 89 percent of Americans believe that heaven is not reserved for those who share their religious faith. </p>
<p>Americans are reluctant to claim that they have a monopoly on truth.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2010/10/18/american-grace-how-religion-divides-and-unites-us-an-interview-with-robert-putnam/">The discussion between Putnam and Mohler</a> is useful for Orthodoxy. If we apply Putnam’s conclusions to orthodox Judaism then the new skeptics, the post-orthodox, and the fault lines in the community are all due to strong political rabbinical control in which rabbis over extending their bounds by banning Slifkin or Avi Weiss. The turn to right wing politics in both American and Israeli politics was not good for keeping people. Putnam argues that this has not been a secularization trend but a break from the conjunction of religion and politics. The young still like relgion just not the political form in which it was presented. Putnam has the data that this change away from the institutional structures will be as great as the 1960&#8217;s losses. (I have been working that assumption with that since this blog started but now I have a footnote.)</p>
<p>Putnam thinks that a successful religious leader is likely to arise who could combine a liberal framework with Evangelical relgion- getting the best of both worlds. Think of combining the Torah and spirituality of Orthodoxy with an open political- social base. The conservative Evangelical Mohler acknowledges that there is wisdom in sociology but then clergy need to learn what to do with the data. Evangelicals should not jump to become judgmental before they have the understanding of what is actually going on in the field.</p>
<p>Mohler askes: if this is true, then what does the future of mission look like? Mohler then hems and haws about what to do with this and states that he is based on the text of the bible and must separate the true message from what may have not been expedient. But he cannot go much further than this.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Putnam:</strong> Well you know it’s interesting, if you just read the raw data you have to say we’re in a period, and have been for the last twenty years, of a sharply increasing secularization mostly because the younger generation, unlike previous younger generations, have just stepped sharply away from organized religion.  And many people, especially many people on the secular side think of this as finally America’s becoming a secular nation.  I actually don’t think that’s quite right. </p>
<p>Many of these young people in their private beliefs have quite conventional religious beliefs.  I think they’ve been very turned off, as I said, by the conjunction of politics and religion.. they’ve essentially said well if that’s all religion is about is just about republican and conservative politics that’s not me, I’m out of here. </p>
<p>And if you ask me, I bet you quite a bit that over the next ten, fifteen, twenty years, some successful religious entrepreneurs, people who want to save a lot more souls will be looking at that pool saying, I think I know the kind of religion that would be attractive to them.  It would be, it might very well have a lot of the accouterments and liturgy and so on of evangelical religion.  </p>
<p><strong>Mohler:</strong> One of the most important acts of intellectual stewardship is to learn how to read a book.  And as I often say to my students we need to read a book for all it’s worth.  And that means putting into context, understanding it’s purpose, being able to judge its credibility, and then considering what kind of intellectual impact it should have on our lives and our thinking&#8230;Now we’re going to be looking at this and inevitably evangelical Christians are going to be reading it with a lens, a focus, that is intensely and unapologetically theological, that’s really important, that’s where we have to begin, and that’s where we have to end.  But we need to read a work of sociology as a work of sociology. So phenomenology attempts not to make a value judgment of whether people are right or wrong, but simply to come to an accurate understanding of what they believe and why it matters.  </p>
<p>I think the genius of this work and where evangelicals are going to find an awful lot of fodder for thought is in the second aftershock</p>
<p>But what Putnam and Campbell come back to demonstrate is that there was another aftershock that began in the 1990’s a response not to the sixties but to that second aftershock.  These were folks who said we don’t like the way that conservative Christians would take this country.  And indeed, we don’t like what we hear.  And he points out some things that evangelicals really need to pay attention to.  For instance, he suggests that the growth in evangelical momentum ended in the 1990’s and thus for a period that could be as long as twenty years, we have been in an era of evangelical retreat.  </p>
<p>How do we communicate our message?  How do we tell people the truth in a way that is hearable and in way that is understandable?  Did you notice when he talks about the religious predictor factor of voting.  </p>
<p>He said something that I never heard said by a scholar in this field of inquiry before.  He said that they determined that when an individual had an incommensurate set of positions with religious beliefs on one hand and political convictions on the other, it was not the case that the religious convictions would drive a change in the political positions.  Instead it turns out that the political positions drive a change in the theological worldview.  Now for evangelical Christians that comes as an explosive bomb.  This is something that needs to get our attention immediately. </p>
<p>A theological lens, we have to look at it with a missiological lens.  We have to look at it first of all as Christians and come to understand that when we look at this kind of data it’s telling us what is, not what ought to be.  We gain out understanding of what ought to be and what ought to be believed first and foremost from the bible.  We’re a people of the book, and so if we’re looking for what to believe we don’t look to this data we indeed look to the word of God.  We also look at it with a theological worldview that given our last conversation of the issue about whether it’s the political position that draws the theological conviction or vice versa , we’re the people who know it better be the theological and biblical conviction that drives all the rest. </p></blockquote>

<p>Beck notes that in the era of cosmopolitanism – liberal tolerance that keeps religion out is not the model anymore. Religion is back, but we want it to be moderate enough not to hurt anyone. Beck notes that many in each faith have to learn to civilize themselves, abjure violence, and commit to mutual tolerance.</p>
<p>Beck notes how the Pope functions as an NGO and that the pope was able to criticize Bush in the name of religion for supporting war and sweatshops. Rabbi Sacks is serving some of the same function on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>Beck offers five models for a more civilized religion. He seems to appreciate all of them and encourages all of them.</p>
<p>1.	The first is based on Thoreau, an acceptance of religious civil disobedience. Social action disagreements as positive because the disagreements overcome depersonalization and denationalization.</p>
<p>2.	His second is the market model, we need to get along to make money.  </p>
<p>3.	Third is Hans Kung’s idea world ethos- we all accept of the Golden Rule and each religion should stress the Golden rule within their relgion. </p>
<p>4.	Fourth, is Gandhi’s religious cosmopolitanism- a combination of syncretism and universal rights and universal reason over ethnicity. </p>
<p>5.	Finally, Jurgen Habermas has argued to let each religion argue in the public sphere based on public discourse. It creates a religiously neutral state in which no religion is enfranchised. </p>
<p>I would add to this that Zygmunt Bauman thinks in an era of “willful ignorance” we need at least a minimum of Levinas’ concern with the other.  We turn our faces from atrocities around the globe or that our products are made in sweatshops. Tzvetan Todorov thinks we need to stress a positive humanism toward others, knowing full well the fragility of it all. And interfaith encounters are on the upswing around the world as a means of moderation and civilization since much of the intolerance is religious based. </p>
<p>One of Beck’s new points is his observation of the rise of reflexive fundamentalism. In the new cosmopolitan age, fundamentalisms clash in violent ways different than the traditional versions. What are the characteristics of the new reflexiveness.</p>
<p>1.	There is a rediscovery of unquestioning  acceptance of relgion. The more religion the less self-reflexive questioning in the classroom. For Beck it functions like a strong brand allegiance.</p>
<p>2.	There is a totalitarian immediacy of God. Believers offer submission to whatever variant is popular in order to gain a direct line. They replace objective world with the subjective world, and use the language of scientific rationality for religious certainty.</p>
<p>3.	There is demonization of believers in other faiths </p>
<p>4.	Finally, globalization allows a transnational network and operation</p>
<p>To Beck, I would add Arjun Appadurai’s observations that now we can be tolerate where we live and project out intolerance on a homeland that we visit regularly. His example is Hindu’s who are tolerant in the US and project intolerance onto Kashmir. Appadurai also notes our ability to have small televised flashpoints like Kashmir or Hebron that allow an unnatural focus. He also notes the breakdown of nationalism has lead to a fear of minorities, in which he observes that the “Fear of small numbers” causes a demonization.</p>
<p>Beck wishes us to replace truth with peace.  (190-194)<br />
1.	Modernity advocated toleration of religion of those I disagree with. They are wrong but I tolerate them. For Beck, this requires a state to enforce it. It needs governmental programs.</p>
<p>2.	  Another option is to return to the double religion of masses and elite. The elite are taught a universalism- like in the older days- and the masses are left alone. Think Plato, Averroes, or Vivekananda.</p>
<p>3.	 We should return to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing parable of the ring from Nathan the Wise.  We avoid all discussion of absolute truth in the name of peace. We live as if there is no true ring.</p>
<p>4.	We should accept God as mediator. To think that God is greater than any one religion, so we cannot totalize our religion. (Rabbi Sacks has this one) Create universalist interfaith leaders.</p>
<p>5.	Advocate grassroots co-operation as a form of religious secularism. Encourage people to separate out good works and making the world a better place from dogma.  Get people to help one another  on economics or climate despite the religious differences. </p>
<p>There will not be a return to people living secular lives in the public sphere.</p>
<p>EJ in his comment on the first post already perceptively noted how hard this will be for Haredim. He also noted the potential reframing for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Someplace in my online classes on the Varieties of Modern Orthodoxy, I mentioned that I would like to give a similar class on the Conservative movement. Well, someone who listened to the series invited me recently to give the talk. So I was looking at some recent Conservative religious thought and here are some thoughts, specifically relating to Orthodox matters. They are not the content of my talk – they are are observations that loop back to things discussed here. These thoughts are impressions of an outsider and maybe over generalized. </p>
<p>For those who want some decent reading of where things are at and going- here are some good links. <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=4&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=623&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=3382&amp;TTL=The_Future_of_Conservative_Jewry">Arnold Eisen’s March 2010 vision for the movement,</a> <a href="http://www.shefanetwork.org/torah_resources">an assortments of current pulpit rabbis giving their important sermons (lots of good stuff in there)</a>, and <a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/11511/">the 2007 short visions for the movement.</a></p>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that the phrase Covenantal approach to Judaism has been gaining traction in the last three years. Covenantal meaning that there is an ongoing relationship with God and hearing God’s word. The traction is not in the name of the movement but in the thinking about applying tradition.There is a subtle shift from “tradition and change” or any legal theory of change to a relationship model. Many of the pulpit rabbis use the phrase to describe the uniqueness of the movement. Eisen speaks of going beyond the sovereign self to the broader commitments of covenant, mizvah, and community. In the debate between emphasizing the head or the heart, the winner seems to be emphasizing people&#8217;s lived narratives.<br />
Orthodox should not be projecting legal theory from prior eras onto contemporary Conservative rabbis. Human dignity and ongoing relationship with God is cited more than Catholic Israel.</p>
<p>Second, I noticed that the big tent is not spoken about anymore.  Rabbi Alan Silverman, one of the short list of candidates to be the new chancellor mentioned the need to going back to being a big tent that embraced the full spectrum of positions. That is distinctly absent from out Arnie Eisen’s rhetoric. Eisen did visit Hesder Yeshivot in his preparation year but did not go that route. I have also noticed a hesitancy about Talmud as a discipline from some of the speeches. Originally, the Conservative movement was focused on peoplehood with influence of Ahad Haam, Dubnow, and others. Someone started calling the movement halakhic in the 1980’s , (I suppose to compete with Centrism’s recent use of the term)That rhetoric has now shifted more to covenantal.  I am speaking about those official statements- those fellow travelers who do not affiliate are more likely to use the term- halakhic.</p>
<p>It is interesting that spirituality is tolerated but not part of anyone’s agenda. The bigger news is that everyone seems to now have caveats on the value of wissenschaft. Pure research in Jewish Studies is left for the university.  Now, scholarship has to be balanced by concern for people’s everyday lives. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, Marshall Sklare was the best analysis of the Conservative movement. It was a practical and pragmatic need to care for the masses of Eastern European immigrants guiding them in their Americanization and then suburbanization. There was nothing overly ideological about the movement. Sklare pointed out the lack of theory, consistency, or roots to Europe. Mordechai Waxman in his <em>Tradition and Change</em> also had a pragmatic understanding of the movement. One of the critiques that Orthodoxy had about the Conservative movement was that it was non-ideological and solely a pragmatic logic. Now, Orthodoxy invests the Conservative movement with an anachronistic heavy ideological mission from the first day. It seems that the debates between Reform and Orthodoxy in the 1840’s have been projected onto the Conservative movement. (I assume everyone has read Sklare and Waxman already).</p>
<p>But just as Reform and Orthodoxy were at their nadirs in 1970, I assume that Conservative movement will regain their traction after retooling. But the biggest question today that keeps coming up in discussions is that the best and brightest, those most committed to Torah study, prayer, and community work are not officially affiliating with the movement. There are many independent minyanim doing well, many political action groups, many dynamic young rabbis, and places like Hadar. Yet, there is a trend not to want to affiliate with the movement. The movement has an image of still too much old time suburban synagogue of the cantor leading everything, responsive reading, no spirit, no learning and still has a post WWII feel.  But there is a new active generation. </p>
<p>When I compare this to Centrist Orthodoxy, the moment of alienation was eclipsed by writing the past off. Back in the early 1980’s, the majority of Orthodox synagogues meant old synagogues in the Bronx, hundreds of small town synagogues in New England and the Midwest, synagogues in declining neighborhoods. Centrist Orthodoxy basically wrote them all off and focused on 10-12 major communities of professionals who send their kids to day schools and have possibly spent a year in Israel. Orthodoxy went from Shapiro’s wine to Cabernet Savignon, from clerks to physicians, and from old time Jews to the new heroic halakhic Jew. Yiddish, nostalgia, and looking backwards were jettisoned. Even synagogues where the former rabbis were important rabbis were ignored if they were in declining neighborhoods. The past was effaced and the word modern was temporarily dropped to be Centrist. No one had a problem doing this because the new generation was frum, learned, and correct in a way the old-timers were not.  No one in the creators of  Centrism had a problem with ignoring the old Jews in the old shuls. (They also ignored most of the West coast, allowing the vacuum to be filled by Chofetz Chayim, Chabad, and Ner Israel- but that is another story.)</p>
<p>To return to what I see, as an outsider, in the Conservative movement. The movement is still holding on to its old haunts and habits in Long island and North East so that the new generation has a disconnect. It still projects Chaim Potok more than contemporary novelists and artists. The movement has everything to gain by embracing all these new dynamic leaders, but they have no need to return to decay of the movement. So things appear less than the sum of the parts. As several of their leaders have noted there is no central organization for seeding and directing social planning. One thing we learned from watching the decline of the mainline churches is that any Church with valuable property like Episcopalians did better than Methodists with their suburban property. Carved Stone buildings in the city are more stable socially than modest wood buildings in the burbs. The movement has inertia.</p>
<p>Finally, the rise of websites like Kosher.com that delivers kosher food to anywhere, allows congregations to exist in communities without kosher butchers, bakeries, or kosher delis and pizza shops. Will that change the observance levels in way out of town communities? </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://http/www.rabbidavidrosen.net/bio.htm">Rabbi David Rosen</a> was the Jewish speaker at this years synod of Bishops, which was dedicated to the situation of Christians in the Middle East. Rosen was the former chief rabbi of Ireland, currently works as the interfaith representative from the AJC, is adviser to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and represents the State of Israel in interfaith dialogue. Rosen may be chosen by the ministry of religion and the chief Rabbinate but his views do not reflect those of the current foreign minister. He also holds a knighthood from the Vatican. Two years ago, the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, Rabbi Shaar Yashuv Cohen spoke at the synod of Bishops. Rabbi Cohen is currently, the de facto rabbinical decider (posek) for matters of interfaith.</p>
<p>In the speech, Rosen first speaks of the changed relationship from teaching of contempt to friendship. Then he speaks about the suffering of Christians in the Middle East (I skipped the political sections because I don’t want to debate politics). Rosen is adamant that  no one should have their dignity and rights taken away. He is glad that Israel has responded to pressure and returned some rights to clergy.  His big plea at the end is that events in middle east and the actions of the Israeli government should not be dampen relations between the faith. He quotes JPII that Judaism is intrinsic to Christianity.</p>
<p>Rabbi Rosen also quotes the Catholic catechism, discussed  here in the comments on the Rabbi Riskin post.  The section he cites is <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> (sect.839) :-&#8220;It is in pondering her own mystery that the Church, the People of God of the New Covenant, discovers her own profound bond with the Jews, who were chosen by the Lord before all others to receive His word.&#8221; Rabbi Rosen cites it from a specific speech of Pope Benedict where Benedict explains this quote as indicating that  &#8220;the Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God&#8217;s revelation&#8221;. This implies that Judaism already contains the Christian revelation but is a different response than the Christian response. The question is whether Judaism is a separate path for Jews or an incomplete version of Christianity. There is also the ambiguity if the mystery of God&#8217;s choosing the Jews is a positive contrast or a negative mystery of contrast. Either way, Christianity has been re-contextualized in Judaism.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http:///www.zenit.org/article-30646?l=english">writeup from Zenit, the News service from Rome.</a> Here is the <a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-30645?l=english">full transcript of the talk.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The  Jewish-Christian relationship and the Middle East<br />
</strong>by Rabbi David Rosen</p>
<p>The relationship today between Christianity and the Jewish people is a blessed transformation in our times &#8211; arguably without historic parallel. In his words in the great synagogue here in Rome last January, H.H. Pope Benedict XVI referred to the teaching of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council as &#8220;a clear landmark to which constant reference is made in our attitude and our relations with the Jewish people, marking a new and significant stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally this striking sea change in the way the Jewish people is viewed and presented , still had and has to contend with the influence of centuries, if not millenia of the &#8220;teaching of contempt&#8221; towards Jews and Judaism, which obviously is not eliminated overnight nor even over forty five years. Accordingly the impact of this transformation in Catholic-Jewish relations varies considerably from one context to another. Arguably the most dramatic internalization has taken place in the United States of America where Jews and Christians live in an open society side by side as vibrant self-confident and civically engaged minorities. As a result the relationship has advanced there to a unique degree involving cooperation and exchanges between the communities and their educational institutions; and today the US boasts literally dozens of academic institutions for Catholic-Jewish studies and relations, while there are perhaps three in the rest of the world. Indeed there is a widespread perception among the Jewish communities in the US of the Catholic Church as a genuine friend with profound values and interests in common.</p>
<p>However there are many countries where the abovementioned social and demographic factors are not present. In most countries where Catholicism is the dominant social force, Jewish communities are small if present at all, and the relationship between the Church and Judaism often gets little notice. I confess to having been surprised to find Catholic clergy and sometimes even hierarchy from some countries, who are not only remarkably ignorant about Judaism, but often even about <em>Nostra Aetate</em> itself and the relevant teachings of the <em>Magisterium</em> concerning Jews and Judaism.</p>
<p>While as indicated, Jewish experience in the US has done much to alleviate negative impressions of the tragic past; there is still widespread ignorance about Christianity in the Jewish world &#8211; especially where there is little or no contact at all with modern Christians.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the plight of Palestinians generally and Palestinian Christians in particular should be of profound concern to Jews both in Israel and the Diaspora.</p>
<p>To begin with, especially as Judaism brought to the world the recognition that every human person is created in the Divine Image; and that accordingly, as the sages of the Talmud teach, any action of disrespect for another person, is an act of disrespect for the Creator himself; we have a special responsibility for our immediate neighbors.<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Below is Rosen&#8217;s well-crafted pitch not to let politics interfere with interfaith relations which is combined with a push to attain greater clarity from the Vatican on the role of Judaism within their theology. Rosen frames the discussion in such a way as to bracket out the more restrictive voices and to push for a stronger theological acceptance of Judaism. He also uses some of the words of JPII to push for an expansive reading of the catechism. The bold was in the version that I received.</p>
<blockquote><p>However the <em>Instrumentum Laboris</em> commenting on <em>Dei Verbum</em> describes the dialogue of  the Church &#8220;with her <em>elder brothers</em>&#8221; as not just necessary, but as &#8220;essential&#8221; (sect.87). Indeed in his visit to the great synagogue in this city this year, Pope Benedict XVI quoted the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> (sect.839) :-<br />
&#8220;It is in pondering her own mystery that the Church, the People of God of the New Covenant, discovers her own profound bond with the Jews, who were chosen by the Lord before all others to receive His word&#8221; ;  and added that &#8220;the Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God&#8217;s revelation&#8221;.<br />
These words echo those of the late Pope John Paul II who in his historic visit to the same central Jewish place of worship in this city in 1986 declared that &#8220;the Jewish religion is not <em>extrinsic </em>to us but in a certain way is <em>intrinsic</em> to our own religion.<br />
With Judaism therefore we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion.&#8221;<br />
Furthermore in his Apostolic Exhortation of June 28<sup>th</sup> 2003 he described <strong>&#8220;dialogue and cooperation with believers of the Jewish religion&#8221;</strong> as being<strong> &#8220;fundamentally important for the self-knowledge of Christians&#8221; in keeping with the Synod&#8217;s call &#8220;for acknowledgment of the common roots linking Christianity and the Jewish people, who are called by God to a covenant which remains irrevocable&#8221;</p>
<p>As I have indicated, I am fully cognizant of the fact that the political realities in the Middle East do not always make it easy for Christians to acknowledge let alone embrace these exhortations. However I pray that the miracle of what John Paul II referred to as </strong>&#8220;the flowering of a <strong>new springtime in mutual relations&#8221; will increasingly become evident in the Middle East, as throughout the world.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/9618">Here is the WJC write-up</a> emphasizing the political.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=191629">Jpost article:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>the Sunni representative, Muhammad al-Sammak, political councilor to the mufti of Lebanon<br />
Asked whether he agreed with Rosen’s statement that Christians could become “blessed peacemakers in the city whose name means peace,” the Lebanese political councilor replied, “I subscribe blindly to anything said by Rabbi David Rosen.”</p></blockquote>

				<p>For my Hebrew readers, there are several recent articles on college that came out this week in Israel. They offer an interesting parallel to the American debates. Dr. Aviad HaCohen defends the academic enterprise against those who blames the ills of society on college such as R. Avraham Wasserman of Yeshivat Ramat Gan. And there is a great interview with Rabbi Shabbtai Rapaport of the Bar-Ilan Kollel on how the college can have both religious and non-religions and that it creates a respect for the Jewish tradition teaching that Judaism is not for the Datiim alone. That he has no problem bringing Academic tools into the study hall. And the section quoted below is a little diatribe against the ignorance of our age.</p>

<p>&#8211;  עם או בלי קשר לידיעה הקודמת, היום <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3967625,00.html">התפרסם  באתר YNET ראיון עם מו&#8221;ר הרב שבתי רפפורט</a>, העומד כיום בראש המכון הגבוה  לתורה (הידוע בכינויו &#8220;הכולל&#8221;) של אוניברסיטת בר-אילן. אני בטוח שלא מעט  מתלמידיו יתקשו להאמין שהוא אמר את המשפט הבא:<br />
זו אוניברסיטה שמנסה לחנך. היא לא פונה רק אל השכל, אלא  גם אל הלב ואל ההכרה וזה האופי המיוחד שלה. המסר שעובר כל הזמן הוא  חשיבותה של המורשת היהודית. וכל הזמן , תוך כדי, לא דוחים אף אחד. לא  אומרים לאף אחד בגלל זה אתה לא יכול ללמוד כאן, אלא אומרים אנחנו  אוניברסיטה שהתורה עניין מרכזי בה, בוא ותראה. בבר אילן את התפיסה הזו  נושמים באויר.<br />
(לשם ההגינות אבהיר שאני לא זוכר אי פעם שהרב שבתי  התבטא כנגד לימודים בבר-אילן או בכל מוסד אקדמאי אחר)<br />
הראיון מסתיים  במשפט שהוא מאד מאד משקף את האיש:<br />
אני חושב שהחיסרון הגדול של דורנו זו הבורות שנובעת מחוסר חשיפה  לתורה. זו אינה בורות של חוסר ידיעה, אלא מתוך הכרה שזה יהיה לי קשה. אני  חושב ששונאי ישראל האשימו אותנו בהרבה דברים, אבל אף פעם לא בטיפשות. עם  ישראל הוא עם חכם. אני חושב שצריך לפתח את תחום התורה והאמונה והמורשת ולא  רק ללמוד אותם. יש לנו מחויבות להוריש לדור הבא משהו עשיר יותר ממה  שקיבלנו.</p></blockquote>
