				<p>Last month, I posted <a href="../../../../2011/12/27/daniel-boyarin-and-orthodoxy-an-interview/index.html">an interview with Daniel Boyarin.</a> To which, I received an email from Kellner shocked that I would interview a non-Zionist who supports enemies of Israel and whose rhetoric was putting his family in danger (see below). To which I answered, that Boyarin is currently the doktorvater of several of my most academically successful students. But, how about an interview for your many readers? He agreed. </p>
<p>Menachem Kellner, Professor of Jewish Thought at the University of Haifa, and Senior Fellow at Merkaz Shalem in Jerusalem, studied philosophy and Jewish philosophy at Washington University (St. Louis) in 1973. Kellner&#8217;s Ph.D. dissertation, written under the direction of the late Steven S. Schwarzschild, was on &#8221; Civil Disobedience in Democracy: A Philosophical Justification.&#8221; He also studied at the Hebrew Theological College in Skokie, IL and at Yeshivat Merkaz Ha-Rav Kook in Jerusalem in the early 60&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Kellner’s works include <em>Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation With Mysticism.</em> (London: 2006 Revised paperback edition: 2010.) <em>Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought</em> (Oxford 1986; Hebrew translation, Jerusalem, 1991), <em>Maimonides on Human Perfection</em> (Atlanta, 1990), <em>Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People</em> (Albany, 1992; Serbian translation, Belgrade, 2000), <em>Maimonides on the “Decline of the Generations” </em>and the <em>Nature of Rabbinic Authority</em> (Albany, 1996), Must A Jew Believe Anything? (London, 1999 &#8212; a Koret Jewish Book Award finalist; 2nd, expanded edition, 2006); the editor of <em>Contemporary Jewish Ethics</em> (New York, 1978), <em>The Pursuit of the Ideal: Jewish Writings of Steven Schwarzschild</em> (Albany, 1990).</p>
<p>Much of the debate around Kellner’s work focuses on his mistitled <em>Must a Jew Believe Anything?</em> It seems from the interview and the new Afterword that the goal of the book was to create greater acceptance of the non-orthodox by  removing dogma from the equation.  But I am not sure that the strategy worked. Kellner’s response to Daniel Statman in the Afterword shows that the book he wanted to write would have looked like this.</p>
<p>1.	Commitment to the peoplehood of Israel (klal yisrael), strong enough to overlook differences.<br />
2.	 A theory of non- Orthodox peoplehood to account for the traditional mesorati, the masses, and the populous. It would have looked to formulate a democratic Judaism like Rabbi Hirchenson or a view like Rav Amsalam.<br />
3.	A vision of peoplehood without ontic status or metaphysical difference, one that can connect with the Jewish past and future.<br />
4.	Keeping mizvot as the basis of peoplehood to follow God’s command, and produce a stable and structured society. Mizvot without preconditions of belief or authority. “If they were to forsake me, I should forgive them, for they may yet keep my Torah.  For if they should  forsake me but keep my Torah, the leaven that is in the Torah will bring them close to me.”<br />
5.	Kellner wants a Jewish peoplehood stronger than Torah, personal religious experience, or individual fulfillment. He would have to deflect the claims of those who do not put peoplehood before Torah or individual commitment such as Rav Soloveitchk, Levinas, Rav Nahman, or the Kotzker.<br />
6.	For Kellner, Modern Jewry is fractured due to challenge of modernity. The Orthodox leadership has been poor and allowed and encouraged the fracture.<br />
7.	Therefore, the use of the Mishnah of Sanhedrin to exclude those who don’t believe is unwise and self-destructive to Jewish peoplehood, even though our modern leaders used it. We should not use categories created to combat against Karaites and Sadducees today to combat Reform and Conservative Jews. We need to reject Rabbinic sectarian thinking.<br />
8.	Finally, he has to convince his readers that pluralism is wrong and relativistic. And that his standard is not patronizing to Reform, Conservative, Renewal, traditional, non-zionist, and other Jews who favor pluralism. </p>
<p>It seems that Kellner was motivated by points 1, 6, and 7&#8212; and that he thought that if he removed dogma then we have enough to substantiate 2, 4, 5, and 7. Statman pinned it down.</p>
<blockquote><p>Menachem comments: To reply to these points would involve rewriting the book; it is easily available for people to read and judge for themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Kellner’s motivation was to stop exclusion of Reform and Conservative Jews, then he seems to have bypassed the actual texts that create the exclusions. All the documents were legal and not dogmatic: from the Hatam Sofer calling Reformers Karaites to Rav Moshe Feinstein calling them minim, halakhic sectarians to Rav Soloveitchik saying that they are outside the halakhic legal tradition.The Hazon Ish was speaking about their lacks of halakhic observance not their lack of dogma. In each case it is the halakhah that decides. If Kellner wanted to be inclusive, then say “God or Torah accepts the mizvot of all Jews.&#8221;  In email correspondence with Kellner, he stated that all of these cases were motivated by dogma, it was the heresy of Reform or Conservative, not the halakhah. Since the halakhic authors all relied on the precedents against Sadducees and Karaites then they are about dogma. I double checked Rav Moshe for a start and read it as legal not dogmatic. For Kellner, since an ordinary Jew who drives to shul can get an aliyah but a Reform Rabbi cannot makes it about dogma.</p>
<p>My own personal opinion is to side with Saadyah and Bahye on the existence of Duties of the Heart and beyond that my views can be can be gleaned from my long questions such as numbers three, four, six, seven, eight and eleven.   I also do find disputes over dogma in Judaism. A social historian may reduce them to politics, paedeia, purity, and power, but that would work just as well regarding Christian heresy hunting. And the leading copied book of Thomas Aquinas’ Summa Theologia was “the book of sales and acquisitions.” I would also recommend historic discussions of what was a sectarian such as Aharon Shemesh. Maimonides has kalam, falasifa, and sufi arguments about dogma which were blurred. </p>
<p>I do not find that <a href="http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/berghahn/0155977x/v52n1/s2.pdf?expires=1329200015&amp;id=67190722&amp;titleid=75002119&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=928CF66CEF8B387EFAB38A70B36AE45F">belief and dogma were sufficiently defined.</a> I could exclude most Christian texts. And all the followers of &#8220;dogmatists&#8221; such as Karl Rahner or even Avery Dulles would find the rigid definition foreign. Most academics who follow in the lines of Bourdieu, or Certeau follow Pascal’s statement as understood by Althusser: &#8220;kneel and pray, and then you will believe&#8221;. For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. What is ultimately important for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the &#8220;minds&#8221; of human individuals, but rather the material institutions, rituals, and discourses that produce these beliefs. More importantly, today I was reading a volume about the transition from Evangelicals to Emergents and the author stressed, seriously stressed, that it is invalid to ask “What do Evangelicals Believe? And that the only valid question is: :”What beliefs and practices are the focus of Evangelical interest, whether they agree or not.” Belief or not – you are still of the same discussion. </p>
<p>Finally, Kellner thinks that Boyarin has written himself out of the Jewish community by giving sympathy to the Palestinian cause and drawing an analogy in the loss of faith between the Holocaust and the Occupation. Much as some Christians said that their religion died at Auschwitz, Boyarin fears that “Judaism may be dying at Nablus.” Steven S. Schwarzschild, Kellner adviser was a liberal anti-Zionist of the Reform- ethical variety. However, Kellner rejects Boyarin for, in his words, going beyond mere anti-Zionism by twisting facts, supporting murders and those driven to destroy Israel, as well as his rejection of attacking Hamas. &#8220;Daniel Boyarin and the Herd of Independent Minds,&#8221; in Edward Alexander and Paul Bogdanor (eds.), The Jewish Divide Over Israel: Accusers and Defenders  (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2006): 167-176.) and here are some online links of Kellner&#8217;s politics:<br />

<p><strong>1. Your dissertation was on ethics and human rights, what happened to that early interest and writings? Do you recognize the immense role your volume on Jewish ethics had in shifting the field to halakhic ethics?<br />
</strong><br />
My dissertation, completed in 1973, was on &#8220;Civil Disobedience in Democracy – A Philosophical Justification,&#8221; written under the direction of the late Steven S. Schwarzschild at Washington University in St Louis, MO (one of three major influences on my life, the other two being my father, Rabbi Abraham Kellner, z&#8221;l, u-tibbadel le-hayyim arukhim ve-tovim, my wife, Jolene S. Kellner). The book you mention, Contemporary Jewish Ethics, grew out of my interest in ethical matters (don&#8217;t forget, I am a child of the sixties), out of my teaching religious ethics at the University of Virginia and in consultation with my friend, David M L Olivestone, then editor of the Hebrew Publishing Company. I had no idea that the book had any role, let alone an &#8220;immense&#8221; one, in shifting the field to halakhic ethics, but I will be sure to tell my wife.</p>
<p><strong>2. What motivated you to write <em>Must a Jew Believe Anything?</em> </strong></p>
<p>Actually, to the best of my recollection, it was<br />
(a) annoyance with the ads the Chief Rabbinate would put in newspapers here in Israel every year before the yamim noraim, warning people not to attend services in Conservative or Reform synagogues. It seemed to me then (and seems to me now) that the Rabbinate would prefer to see secular Israelis spend Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur at the beach or on picnics than in non-Orthodox synagogues.<br />
(b) growing concern over the way in which Orthodoxy, by drawing ever sharper lines of demarcation, pushes Jews away from Torah instead of bringing them closer.<br />
(c) a number of experiences made me realize that the &#8220;tinok she-nishba&#8221; solution, while well-meaning is deeply patronizing, as well as making very little sense in today&#8217;s world.</p>
<p><strong>3. Solomon Schechter and others wrote that Judaism does indeed have theology and dogmas but we have no Council of Nicea for fixed dogma, no dogmatic works, and no inquisition or magisterium. But we do have doctrine. In your afterword, in replying to your critics, you seem to have the same position as Schechter but you label it as “We don’t have to believe rather than “we have dogmas without dogmatisim” Why?</strong></p>
<p>Dogma is a device for determining who is &#8220;out&#8221;. I think that the demand of the hour is finding ways of keeping Jews &#8220;in&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>4. You Maimonides is not Ibn Sina and al Farabi. You seen not to use the intellectualist Neo-Platonism of the <em>Guide of the Perplexed. </em> And both Halevi and Maimonides are reliant on al-Ghazzali and ibn Sina. You seem to have a philosopher’s typology of rational and irrational, natural and supernatural, action or belief that does not correspond to the complexity of the historical data. Are you reading Maimonides thought through the dogmatic lenses of your early work in dogmas in the 14th and 15th century?</strong></p>
<p>Look, you may be right, but you must admit that Rambam invites us to read him in that way. Let me rephrase that. I am writing a book in Hebrew right now, proving (to my complete satisfaction, and, I hope, the satisfaction of my readers) that for Rambam there is no metaphysical, ontological, upfront, innate, etc. difference between Jew and Gentile (as my friend Danny Lasker likes to say, the difference for Rambam is all in the software, not in the hardware). I have been publishing on this for many years; in this new book I address the issue through a very close reading the first,  middle, and last halakhot of the Mishneh Torah. The first sentence of the book is: &#8220;Maimonides did not know that he was a universalist.&#8221; It is obviously the case that we ask questions of Rambam that he may not have asked himself, and we try to follow the implications of his thought to places he may have had no need or interest in getting to (for example: his &#8220;proto-feminism&#8221;). We are not living in the twelfth century.</p>
<p><strong>5. Does everything boil down to  “mymonides” and “yourmonides?”</strong></p>
<p>Hardly; some interpretations make more sense that others, and some are simply ridiculous (for an example, see the discussion in Hakirah 11). I am quite taken with a method proposed by the philosopher Susan Haack (in the context of an argument against epistemological relativism); I see Maimonides&#8217; writings as a kind of crossword puzzle. At any given point in filling out a crossword puzzle, a number of different solutions might satisfy any given hint. But that does not make all solutions equally reasonable. As Haack notes, &#8220;How reasonable a crossword entry is depends on how well it is supported by its clue and any already completed entries; how reasonable these other entries are, independent of the entry in question; and how much of the crossword has been completed.&#8221; Reading Maimonides as a particularist, for example, demands the revision of a great many already completed entries in the Maimonidean crossword.</p>
<p><strong>6. Rabbinic texts are filled with theological material as read by Schechter, Heschel, and Idel, and the texts of Tanhuma, Pesikta, and Kallir are filled with theological statements. It seems that you are using a 20th century halakhic definition of the rabbis. </strong></p>
<p>Of course there is theological MATERIAL in rabbinic literature ( how could there not be?), but there is no SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY in two sense of the term: (a) an attempt to get clear on the meaning of theological terms (such as &#8220;soul&#8221;; &#8220;free will&#8221;; &#8220;creation&#8221;; &#8220;reward and punishment&#8221;; &#8220;election&#8221;) and<br />
(b) there is no attempt to put these (largely inchoate) ideas into any relationship with each other, thus allowing for out and out contradictions, which bother no one. In sum, theology is an answer to questions which did not trouble Hazal one bit.</p>
<p><strong>7. You seem to accept the Buberian distinction between belief and trust and his rejection of dogma, even though you protest that you are not. You accept the rejection of the medieval tradition. I cannot find significant differences between your position and Buber except for the halakhah.  Furthermore, you repeat your heavy dependence on Buber in the Irreconcilable Differences? volume, in that case distorting Christianity.</strong></p>
<p>My understanding is that Buber&#8217;s distinction is too sharp: Christians also prize trust in God, and Jews do not adopt an &#8220;anything goes approach&#8221; in matters of belief. But, overall, he is right: emunah means &#8220;trust&#8221; more than it means &#8220;intellectual acquiescence&#8221;. </p>
<p><strong>8. You seem heavily dependent on the historical premise that the pressures of modernity causes an intolerance, yet there are lots of 13-18 centuries debates and exclusions over dogma. There were two centuries of Maimonidean debates and then recurrences in 16th- 18th centuries in Poland and Italy. For example, the Gra excommunicated Hasidim because of theology and successfully kept them out of Lita!</strong></p>
<p>It is simply not the case that there &#8220;are lots of 13-18 century debates and exclusions over dogma.&#8221; As I point out in my book on dogma, Rambam &#8220;published&#8221; his principles in roughly in 1168 and before 1391 there were next to no &#8220;debates and exclusions over dogma.&#8221; So, it is hardly surprising that I asked myself why this was the case. Ditto for the lack of &#8220;debates and exclusions over dogma&#8221; between 1492 and the beginning of the 19th century. As to the Gr&#8221;a, you know better than me, but was theology really the main issue between him and the Ba&#8217;al ha-Tanya?</p>
<p><strong>9. Are there any  orthodox leaders, writers, or thinkers who you follow or inspire you?</strong></p>
<p>Rabbis Marc Angel, Yehudah Amital (z&#8221;l), Haim Amsalem, David Bigman, Yuval Cherlow, Edward M. Davis, Ronen Lubitch, Haim Navon, Jonathan Sacks and many others. I am sure that there are others and apologize to those whom I have inadvertently left out.</p>
<p><strong>10. Why have you taken up the case against <em>Torat Hamelekh?</em></strong></p>
<p>Because:<br />
(a) it is a disgusting book<br />
(b) it adds insult to injury by implying that Rambam would agree with them<br />
(c) it is dangerous, giving rabbinic imprimatur to murderous tendencies</p>
<p><strong>11. It seems that you want your cake and to eat it too, you want to be a universalist but through particularistic texts. You avoid pluralism or non- Jewish texts about universalism for a Jewish universalism in which non-Jews will eventually see their universalism through Judaism.  You seem to have a very particularistic universalism?</strong></p>
<p>The following is not a direct answer to your question, but it is a good way to end anyway. It is the closing paragraph of an article of mine in a festschrift coming out in honor of Rabbi Jonathan Sacks:</p>
<p>While not giving up on the idea that revelation (be it Jewish, Christian, or Muslim) teaches truth in some hard, exclusivist sense, putative addressees of revelation ought to be modest about how much of it they understand, and restrained in the claims they make on behalf of revelation and about adherents of other religions. </p>
<p>Admittedly, it may be easier for a Jew to advance this position than for a Christian or a Muslim. This is so for several reasons. First, until the Middle Ages, at least, Jews sought to understand how God instructs them to inject sanctity into their lives, and paid very little attention to the question of how God expects them to think. Given the notion that the Torah contains many level of meanings, and the profound differences among Jewish thinkers about the nature and content of those meanings, a stance of theological modesty ought to be easier for Jews to maintain than for adherents of more clearly theologically based religions. </p>
<p>Second, given the nature of Jewish-Gentile relations over the last two millennia, Jews had very little reason to look to Gentiles for spiritual enrichment. We, however, live in a different world, and I thank God for that.</p>
<p>Last, Jews, not thinking that one must be Jewish in order to achieve a share in the world to come, have traditionally paid little attention to the beliefs and practices of others. But, having left the ghetto and the mellah, we live in a world very different from that of our forbears and, looking around, discover admirable Gentiles from whom we can learn much. We are no longer alone.</p>
<p>The Lord of all the Universe is not too great to have revealed the Torah to us, but is certainly too great to be captured by our puny understanding of Torah. To claim otherwise is to be guilty of cosmic hubris, and to close ourselves off to the possibility of being enlarged by meetings with others who also seek God and whom God does not ignore.</p>

				<p>This is continued from <a href="../../../../2012/01/30/aryeh-kaplan-a-lost-homily-from-his-d-c-pulpit-and-outreach-at-suny-albany/index.html">my perilous post on Aryeh Kaplan</a>. I may combine both posts into one longer post for posterity. </p>
<p>When Rabbi Leonard Kaplan first showed up to the pulpit in Mason City Iowa, he gave a talk to the sisterhood on the process of his receiving ordination in Israel. I wonder how awkward this was, especially with the head of the sisterhood leading the opening prayer and despite his immense learning, his having to shepherd girl scouts and teach once a week Hebrew school.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx-img=108886469.html">Ordination of a  “Rabbi  in Israel&#8221; </a> was the  topic discussed by  Rabbi  Leonard  Kaplan  at the  joint  meeting  of  Adas  Israel Sisterhood  and  Hadassah in  the  synagogue  Thursday. Rabbi Kaplan received his theological training at Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, New York and Mirrer Yeshiva in New York and in Jerusalem. He was ordained in Israel with ordination both at the seminary and by  the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel.</p>
<p>The Opening prayer was given by Mrs. L. IT. Wolf</p>
<p>The girl scout Sabbath was announced at the March services </p>
<p>A purim cantata.. . wil be presented Sunday evening. At 7:30 PM<br />
Mrs.  Kaplan was welcomed as a  new  member.</p></blockquote>
<p> Rabbi Kaplan was quite active in interfaith events, our reader David Zinner <a href="http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=108889709">already pointed to one of them.</a>  In a church interfaith meeting and potluck meal, which followed a vote by the Episcopalians allowing women to the vestry, Kaplan addressed them with a universal message. Each relgion speaks for God and we should not limit God to our own faith. Back to his mathematical model, knowing only one religion is flat and one dimensional, to truly know God we need the multi-dimensional view. All religions are one part of the infinite depth of God.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=108889709">Mason City Globe Gazette</a> – • January 17, 1966 – • Page 15<br />
St. John&#8217;s Episcopal Church Sunday night became the first Episcopal Church in the state reported as electing two women to its vestry. Elected to the local congregation&#8217;s administrative body…</p>
<p>In the general annual meeting which followed a potluck meal, the group heard Rabbi Leonard M Kaplan of Adas Israel Synagogue say:</p>
<p>“ We often spend much effort in making a god out of our particular religion. Shouldn’t we spend just as much effort in making our religion a religion of God?” Rabbi Kaplan called for efforts to appreciate strange and often exotic religions, understanding that each one speaks for God and may even have a message for us.</p>
<p>For many of the world’s people, Rabbi Kaplan said, religion is the most important thing in their lives and understanding them calls for understanding their view of God.</p>
<p>“In a sense, every religion is an open eye upon God, giving us its own flat, one-dimensional view, He said. It is only the totality of them all that can give us a multidimensional view of the Divine and a panorama of infinite depth.…”</p>
<p>Rabbi Kaplan said that many scholars are finding they must study mankind as “a single gigantic organism… spread over the face of the earth.</p>
<p>“If it were God’s purpose in creating this creature that is mankind, to create a being that perceive the divine, then is it not logical that He should have given it many senses?”</p>
<p>“The eye does not hate the ear for not seeing. The ear does not despise the nose for not hearing. The many religions perceive God, each in a different way. But as long as they all look toward God, they are one.“</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, <a href="http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=108889112">in this article,</a> he welcomes Sister Mary Josita and her Bible students to the synagogue and explains the Sefer Torah to them.<br />
After explain the Shofar, he quips that the shofar  &#8216;will probably not be the type to be blown by Gabriel at the second  coming.&#8221;  &#8221; G a b r i el would never put the Beatles out of business.” He seems to have done quite a few wedding jointly with Reform and Conservative clergy- <a href="news.google.com/newspapers-nid=1917&amp;dat=19700601&amp;id=EmxGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2582,78419.html">here</a> and <a href="news.google.com/newspapers-nid=1917&amp;dat=19690715&amp;id=DNhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1egMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=574,2976494.html">here.</a> Among his activities, he took the time to write to <a href="http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201966.pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201966%20-%203681.PDF">Dear Abby about cherubs.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>DEAR &#8216;ABBY: You are not  likely to find any girl cherubs  (or cherubim) since the Hebrew word &#8220;cherub&#8221; is a noun of masculine gender. According to the Hebrew grammar,  a girl cherub would not be a  cherub at all, but a &#8220;chewbah.&#8221; And the plural of &#8220;cherubah&#8221; is &#8220;cheruboth&#8221;—  not &#8220;cherubim,&#8221;—which is the plural of &#8220;cherub^&#8217;<br />
RABBI LEONARD M. KAPLAN , MASON CITY. IA.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that he did not entirely switch to from Leonard to Aryeh in 72-73. As a Rabbinic consultant for the movie Yentl in 1980, he still used the name Leonard <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=M1MnT8O-OKHz0gHZybykAg&amp;id=HB5PAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=rabbi+leonard+kaplan+cast+on+ritual&amp;q=rabbi+leonard+kaplan+cast+on+ritual#search_anchor">in the stories and byline.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Rabbi Leonard Kaplan,&#8221; the writer reports, “enjoyed advising the cast on ritual and its meaning. He showed them how to sway and bend while they pray, explained what it means to study the Talmud and in general helped the cast understand the outlook of a religious Jew<br />
Rabbi Kaplan was not upset by his association with a  play which contains nudity as well as a woman dressed as a man &#8216;It is an abomination,'&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;&#8216;But so what? </p></blockquote>
<p>For those looking for a good introduction to Aryeh Kaplan during the years 73-83, when Kaplan lived and struggled in Kensington, I recommend <strong>Perle Besserman, Pilgrimage : adventures of a wandering Jew<br />
Boston : Houghton Mifflin, 1979.</strong> Perle describes her journeys to India and Israel interspersed with two in-depth visits to Aryeh Kaplan’s living room world. The underemployed Kaplan gave classes in his home on Shabbat and during the week on the deep inner meaning to reality to a variety of seekers including the variety of modern orthodox psychologists listed in the introduction to Jewish meditation, Jews on return from India, those who also hung around Reb Shlomo Carelbach and Reb Zalman, and those who just crashed on his couch. She called Kaplan’s teachings a form of karma yoga, a path of deeds and the deeds that you do cause a perfection of your soul. The book also contains a rare 1970’s interview with Rabbi Zvi Yehudah Kook. (h/t for Pilgrimage- R. Yosef Blau  circa 1991).</p>

				<p>Over at H-Judaica, there is a hunt for Aryeh Kaplan’s physics MA or any evidence to document his work in the field.  They did turn up that the Memphis raised southerner went under his birth name Leonard M Kaplan to University of Maryland and had two co-authored articles in <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/c10k8822x575141l/">1965</a> and <a href="http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v8/i11/p2194_s1?isAuthorized=no">1966. </a>Between 1965 and his burst into NCSY tracts and Chassidism in translation in 1973, he did many activities that are usually not discussed such as elementary school teacher in Louisville Kentucky, Conservative rabbi, and abstract artist. By 1965, he had already relinquished physics graduate school and was a rabbi in Mason City Iowa, a congregation that only had a late Friday night service. <a href="http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=108889109">Here is a lost homily</a> of his that was syndicated as part of a clergy column where he sees modern science including the synthesis of life in a test tube as pointing to God’s greatness. True scientists marvel at the secret of life. </p>
<blockquote><p>•&#8221;Lift lift your eyes on high, and see: Who hath created these? He that bringeth on their host by number, He calleth them all by name (Isaiah 40:26)</p>
<p>Rabbi Leonard M. Kaplan<br />
Adas  Israel Synagogue<br />
7th N.W. &amp; Adams</p>
<p>From the day that man  first appeared on this planet, he has looked on high at the stars and the world around him, and he has stood in awe before the great mystery of creation. He would try to reach up to the stars, and he would climb the highest mountain peaks, but still they would appear far away, blinking steadily in their continued silence, mocking the puny man who would presume to fathom their origin, their nature, and their destiny. But man was not easily discouraged. He continued to climb and probe the mystery of the stars, the riddle of the atom, and even the  secret of life itself. Today, mankind finds himself on the threshold of creating life. By duplicating conditions of a primeval earth, scientists have already succeeded in bringing forth the most primitive form of  pre &#8211; life. This has lead many psuedo-scientists of narrow mental gauge to proclaim that man no longer needs to believe in God, and that science has done away with all mystery and miracle. </p>
<p>But the true thinking scientist knows that the  exact opposite is true — that science has enormously increased man&#8217;s sense of mystery, and that all of nature is nothing but a huge miracle.</p>
<p>When  astronomers explore galaxies billions of light years away, they find that they are made of the same matter as the stuff beneath our  feet. Only one kind of matter is found to   exi st throughout the entire universe. Yet, this unique material has one exceptional property — it can support life, and under proper conditions, it can even give rise to life. The  fact that inert matter carries the potential of life cannot be considered a mere random accident. It can be nothing less than the work of a purposeful Creator. How then can we imagine something as simple as the electron carrying within  itself the potential of the human brain, had not humanity been anticipated by the Designer of all creation? Even the Bible does not tell us that God created life, but rather that He said, &#8220;Let the earth bring forth living creatures.&#8221; (Genesis 1:24). God created matter — the dust of the earth — with the potential of al! life. If scientists are successful in creating true life, our belief in God should be all the stronger, for who else but an omniscient- God could have created the elementary particles of matter with all the inherent potentialities of the human spirit? The handwriting of God is clear — not on the wall — but in the very heart of nature.<br />

<p>Here we have a JTA bulitein about Kaplan in his role as rabbi of Ohav Shalom, a Conservative synagogue in Albany where he also serves as as Jewish student adviser at SUNY at Albany. He is working to provide kosher food and is involved in outreach.  Notice in the language of the announcement the language of the 1960’s “free university” and  “eschews formal leadership.” Aryeh Kaplan’s describes his classes as follows: &#8220;Many college students turn to drugs and the Eastern religions searching for a mystic and deeply spiritual experience,&#8221; the prospectus said. &#8220;Most of these are not at all aware of Judaism&#8217;s great mystic and spiritual tradition. Especially relevant to this quest is Hassidism, which stands unique as the world&#8217;s only popular mystic movement.&#8221; Three years later, he starts publishing his Hasidism as popular mysticism and having everything that Eastern mysticism contains. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="archive.jta.org/article/1970/07/07/2953988/project-to-rediscover-jewish-values-launched-by-students-at-state-university-of-ny.html">Project to Rediscover Jewish Values Launched by Students at State University of N.Y.</a><br />
ALBANY, N.Y., Jul. 6 (JTA) –<br />
A group of students at the State University of New York at Albany (SUNYA) is planning to launch a &#8220;Jewish Rediscovery Project&#8221; on the campus next fall. Its motivation is &#8220;a common desire to rediscover Jewish values relevant to current problems and to act upon such problems as a Jewish group,&#8221; according to a prospectus released here. The youngsters are working with Rabbi Leonard M. Kaplan of Congregation Obav Sholom, the Jewish religious advisor at SUNYA. They estimate the Jewish student population at 2,370 or 19.5 percent of the 12,125 total, and the Jewish faculty at 200 members, 9.2 percent of the total. According to Rabbi Kaplan, Jewish student activists are already largely responsible for the creation of the first full Judaica department in the entire New York State University system, which will open in September under the chairmanship of Prof. Jerome Eckstein. They are also responsible for a Free University of Judaica, offering courses that would not normally come under the Judaica Department; a kosher food plan provided by the University, and a special Passover food plan administered by the University, Rabbi Kaplan reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jewish Rediscovery Project&#8221; is the tentative name for a series of programs expected to attract large numbers of students who find traditional Jewish organizational hierarchies and programs repellant and irrelevant to their interests and their intellectual and spiritual needs. The series eschews formal leadership structure in favor of what the students call sub-cooperatives without chairman and officers, in which leadership is expected to rise spontaneously according to the project&#8217;s needs. The student most responsible for the program, according to Rabbi Kaplan, is Tobi Goldstein a sophomore. The prospectus calls for four sub-cooperatives&#8211;a Study Cooperative, an Information Cooperative, an Action Cooperative and a Religion Cooperative. In the latter, students will explore Hassidism as an avenue to mystical experience. &#8220;Many college students turn to drugs and the Eastern religions searching for a mystic and deeply spiritual experience,&#8221; the prospectus said. &#8220;Most of these are not at all aware of Judaism&#8217;s great mystic and spiritual tradition. Especially relevant to this quest is Hassidism, which stands unique as the world&#8217;s only popular mystic movement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>We owe Rabbi David Etengoff a thank you for recently placing many of the <a href="http://www.box.com/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/2/129360005/1003195725/1#/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/1/129360005">public lectures of Rav Soloveitchik online in cleaned</a>-up mp3 format. </p>
<p>On the list was one public discourse that I had not heard or read called <a href="http://www.box.com/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/1/129360005#/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/2/129360005/1003195725/1">“5122 KNESSETH TISROEL &#8211; DIALOGUE 04/25/78.”</a> It was a real winner. It was a discussion with Orthodox mental health professionals and it discussed several hot topics including the meaning of Lonely Man of Faith, Israeli politics, abortion, homosexuality, Chabad, BT’s, and the role of the social worker. </p>
<p>More importantly, it shows how people related to Rav Soloveitchik and his replies to inquiries. Especially in the last 15 minutes of the tape one can see (1) how Rav Soloveitchik gave his students great latitude to solve problems themselves, (2) how he trusted professionals, (3) how did not think that everything needed halakhic or rabbinic answers (4) and how he took his answers to be his own personal formulation, not some binding or definitive understanding. The tape also show Rav Soloveitchik in several moods from impatient to jovial and it especially showed how Rav Soloveitchik dealt with ideas and not with the bottom line.</p>
<p>If you have never heard a full shiur from Rav Soloveitchik or have not heard one in many years or even if you have forgotten why people where once upset about the current revisionism of the Rav, then please listen to this lecture (or at least the last 15 minutes). It has good audio quality. This lecture will remind you why people were attracted to Rav Soloveitchik. I do not intend to mediate your direct encounter with his shiur, and that is why <a href="http://www.box.com/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/1/129360005#/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/2/129360005/1003195725/1">this one</a> is such a good choice.</p>
<p>The setting is 1978, Annie is the wholesome smash hit on Broadway and Billy Joel’s The Stranger is on the pop radio stations. Picture the younger professionals wearing big tortoise-shell eyeglass frames and long side-burns. Deeply colored sweaters and sports jackets were in style that year, colors like wine, cranberry, and olive- on the tape you will hear people referred to by their clothes color. The Rav himself tended to wear light colored sports jackets to events like this. </p>
<p>It was a decade after his Lonely Man of Faith lecture done originally as a mental health lecture and less than a year after a follow-up lecture in Boston 1977 covering much of the same material. The setting this time is NY and the gathering is of Orthodox mental health professionals, mainly MSW’s and psychologists including Paul Kahn, Rivka Danzig, Lester Kaufman, Carmi Schwartz, and Rabbi Avrach, the Director of Community Services Division. In the 1970’s, psychology, therapy, and existential therapy reigned supreme. The Yeshivish answer was still to ban majoring in psychology. It also produced books like  <em>Avraham Amsel’s Rational Irational Man – Torah Psychology </em>(1976), which denigrated psychology as not the Torah’s way since the emotions need to be suppressed into a rational and volitional life. Several people in the room whom I did not mention, were graduates of Chaim Berlin or Torah ve Daas who a few years earlier switched from suits to turtlenecks and under the influence of the early 1970’s discovered the humanistic path of psychology based on not repressing emotions; gestalt, transaction, and existential therapies replaced repression. People were reading Erik Erikson, Irwin Yalom, R. D. Laing, and Fritz Perls. The Bob Newhart show about therapy had just ended its six year run that month. In the 1960’s and 1970’s the seeming only Rosh Yeshiva to field the new questions was Rav Soloveitchik. At the same time notice how philosophic and abstract were his answers.</p>
<p>A mere decade later Rabbi Twerski will make the liberalism of self-esteem humanistic psychology and twelve step as a seminal start of the new Yeshivish self-help books and in contrast some of YU’s graduates will start reading the more conservative works by authors like Dobson. There is a switch to asking what causes the individual to be deviant, rather than creating a role for the individual.Now, thirty years later every Rosh Yeshiva and pulpit rabbi is an expert on psychology and social work without the need for professional trained guidance.  But in 1978, the burning question is how do we balance the individualism and lack of repression in therapy with commitment to the group, the halakhah community. In the discussion, notice the lack of a role for evil inclination, or any mussar advice to restrain or repress oneself. </p>
<p>When you listen to the tape notice how often Rav Soloveitchik says “ I created” “personal experience” and  “my formulation.” Also notice his joke that he took tranquilizers and they didn’t help him as much as Talmud study helped him.</p>
<p>He discusses the Jewish commitment to the Israel. His politics is old time Likkud. We did indeed dislocate the Arabs but that does not matter. We were the ones who started the trouble in Hebron- why did we did it? Because Israel and our connection to it is our insanity.  We are willing to go against the whole world. We are willing to defy common sense because of our connection.  Defiance and redemptive go together.</p>
<p>In this discussion, he uses the word mesorah to refer to the continuity of the Jewish people and to the chain of scholars of the mesorah. He does not use it as a body of knowledge or a specific teaching. The Mesorah community extends from Avraham to messiah and offers a sense of calming sense of eternity that transcends the individual. Being part of the mesorah offers a deeper reality that unites past and future. We are joined as part of a covenantal community of every Jew who was in the past and those who have yet to appear. Respect for the elders and our antecendents and a commitment for educating future generations.(similar to LMF)</p>
<p>The Rav says that only when his parents died did he find the malakh hamaves confronting him “My Cartesian awareness included a sense of my parents.”</p>
<p>Can we help a homosexual alleviate guilt? “I am not a social worker.” But the goal is not to tell him “sin and be happy.” People have freedom and people can change. There is no need to reject any case. We believe people have the ability to do teshuvah. Don’t encourage sin but there is always hope. But, you may not encourage homosexual practices. (Notice what the discussion looked like before the culture wars- neither condemnation not acceptance, just what is the social worker’s responsibility? Notice how Rav Soloveithcik is mainly concerned with what the observant therapist should do and does not make big statements about society or public policy.) </p>
<p>Can one go against respecting one’s parents kibud av ve am as part of the process of therapy. He answers that the goal is to follow the right way but process may be far from it. So temporary violation is OK as part of a bigger process.</p>
<p>What about college women who are sexually active but not using birth control, therapist cannot pasken birth control questions but it may lead to an abortion? Answer- You are not responsible for events in the future.<br />
What about people having an abortion- it is forbidden but what you should do? Answer- Abortion is completely prohibited as murder, we just do not consider it libel for punishment&#8230; What to do? I don’t know. </p>
<p>How do we apply these guidelines when the social worker is orthodox and client is not religious.<br />
Rav Soloveitchik- “It is up to the social worker – I cannot advice – it is hard.” This is the Rav Soloveitchik that many remember who left applications in the hands of professionals. </p>
<p>He praises Chabad and its success because they temporarily display tolerance. They show understanding and lend a helping hand.<br />
One cannot condemn client right away. And to earn respect means professional respect as a skilled and understanding professional. (not respect for sticking to one’s opinions.)</p>
<p>He tells the story of certain girl who became a BT but was not ready for taryag mizvot, all the mizvot. First she went to a known gadol –rosh yeshiva, who said it was an all or nothing package either keep Shabbos or else. She wet to another rabbi who said accept one mizvah with the complete letter of the law. She did and eventually became completely observant.  (What lesson do you think his listeners drew from the story?)</p>
<p>In the last five  minutes, the Rav was asked “is that [the Rav’s approach in LMF] the only method or the [definitive]  halakhic method? Is this the necessary approach toward Keneset Yisrael or is there another method?</p>
<p>The Rav answers that his loneliness is his creative experience and his binding himself to the group cures his loneliness. Being part of the group of keneset yisrael is not his creative time. Rather, his individual loneliness which is an “Awareness of self- not mere introversion or introspection.” But, “Community man is not creative. We have a dialectic back and forth. (Notice he did not consider his approach definitive.)</p>
<p>Certain times I don’t want to give or teach. They say  I am a good teacher. A good teacher forms a community in his class. Not technical teaching but to discuss and debate problems &#8211; and sometimes they are right and  I admit it.  One needs to be sincere and consistent. Sometimes the students know as much as I do and  I have nothing to teach so I retreat. The need to give is called hesed- to teach is a very volatile activity. (Notice that he defines his teaching an shiur not as offering fixed answers but as discussion and debate. Also notice how impatient Rav Solovetichik was in giving over his prepared précis of LMF, and how relaxed he is in fielding questions.)</p>
<p>Final words on being a social worker. “There is no difference between a social worker or a rabbi concerning their duties as a Jew In fact, a social worker can accomplish more. A social worker is perceived as neutral and objective- and can be more effective. </p>
<p>As a closing comment, the moderator said “Rav Soloveitchik does fancy footwork- he wants idea and we want to drag him down.” (Notice they did not see the Rav as practical guidance or halakhah, rather as ideas and big guidelines. This led to each listener interpreting it for themselves. Unless someone violated the guideline in a major way, they were not reigned in).</p>
<p>[I only listened to the tape once, so if I made any mistakes they were inadvertent, and I will be glad to change what I wrote.]  If you cannot find time to <a href="http://www.box.com/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/1/129360005#/shared/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/2/129360005/1003195725/1">listen to the entire tape </a>then just listen to the last 15 minutes to get a taste of his personality.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In the past I linked to Prof. M.G Piety&#8217;s blog on Kierkegaard and her coverage of the controversy over Kierkegaard&#8217;s antisemitism and it got picked up by JID. So, I assumed that people would keep track of her translation work without my prompting, but it seems from her self-posted hit count numbers that other have not linked to her. But she keeps posting good material. She has recently started translating the preface to Peter Tudvad&#8217;s book and his discovery of the Nazi use of Kierkegaard. Here are some selections.</p>
<blockquote><p>I ran across a couple of articles on Søren Kierkegaard from the beginning of the 1940s while doing research for a book about a Danish nurse in the German Red Cross during the Second World War. To stumble on article on Kierkegaard was in itself not surprising. What was surprising was that they were in National Socialisten [the National Socialist] and Jul i Norden [Jul in the North], two strongly anti-Semitic publications associated with the Nazi party in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>“Søren Kierkegaard is without question the greatest genius the Danish nation has produced” began one of the articles. Moreover, continues the author, “his writings contain the best instructions for the liberation of the Danish people from the spirit of Judaism which has come increasingly to dominate Denmark and which he saw himself as called by providence to fight. One could thus to this extent be justified in asserting that Søren Kierkegaard was the first Danish National Socialist.”</p>
<p>The author would not have been able to support such a claim, even if he had done extensive research, given that Kierkegaard was vehemently opposed to every form of both nationalism and socialism. On the other hand, there is something to the claim that Kierkegaard wanted to free the Danish people–or preferably all of Christendom–from “the Jewish spirit” which he, like the Nazis, viewed as materialistic, and which he increasingly portrayed as essentially in opposition to Christianity.</p>
<p>I realized to my own shame, after reading these two articles, that I had also been all too willing to ignore, or to explain away, Kierkegaard’s anti-Semitism. I thus wrote an article on this topic for the magazine of Jewish culture, Guldberg. I cited Kierkegaard’s references, just as had Geill, to a Jewish editor as a “Jøde Dreng” [Jew-boy] and to “en trællesindet Jøde øvende Herskermagt” [a servile Jew exercising power] as well as his observation concerning this same editor and the distribution of his paper that  “only a Jew could be fitted for this most equivocal of all tyrannies, even more equivocal than that of a usurer (to which the Jew, however, is best suited).”<br />
He says first that ‘Kierkegaard’s references to the Jews were much harsher than those of other intellectuals of the period, but then that it is believed that he identified himself with Jews whom he thought were fundamentally unhappy.”  He observes later that Kierkegaard emphasized “Judaism was the enemy of Christianity, but most of what he objected to in Judaism was precisely what he criticized contemporary Christianity for.”</p>
<p>Once again, the reader is instructed to appreciate that despite Kierkegaard’s apparent anti-Semitism, he was not anti-Semitic in that his overarching purpose was an attack on the Christianity of his day rather an attack on Judaism, and it is in this light that one must understand his possible identification of himself with Jews as an unhappy people.</p>
<p>So far as I know, no one until now has answered these questions, despite the fact that a Danish scholar touched on aspects of the reciprocal relationship between Judaism and Christianity in Kierkegaard’s authorship in 1999. <a href="http://pietyonkierkegaard.com/2011/12/26/part-i-of-the-preface-to-tudvads-book-stadier-paa-antisemitismens-vej/">Read the Rest Here.</a></p></blockquote>

				<p>I just discovered that the Soncino Talmud has been reformatted by Reuven Brauner as a usable pdf, <a href="http://www.halakhah.com/">available here.</a>  h/t-<a href="http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2012/01/newly-formatted-soncino-talmud-freely.html"> On the Main Line. </a></p>
<p>I took a few moments to look at several of the pages and <a href="http://www.halakhah.com/talmud/nezikin_h.html">the introduction by Chief Rabbi Hertz</a> caught my eye.  He treats the Talmud as a record of the discussions fo the Rabbis that captured everything they said, good and bad, learned and unlearned, noble and degrading. He is willing to say about parts of the Talmud: “some of the customs depicted or obiter dicta reported, are repugnant to Western taste need not be denied. “ And he concludes that the legends, discussions, science, and folkways “consists of mere individual utterances that possess no general and binding authority.”</p>
<p>Hertz’s approach to the Talmud is similar to that of Shadal who in his letters deals with difficult Talmudic texts by declaring that they are just person opinion. WE lack an article on Western European Orthodox rabbinical attitudes to the Talmud. From Shadal to Steinsaltz; they tended to share Hertz view. In contrast, in Eastern Europe every line of the Talmud was sacrosanct.  The Mahara”tz Chayes dealt with the folklore, demons, and unwisdom by declaring that it was not to be taken literally, rather it contained hidden didactic messages. It had to be allegory or hyperbole.  But Hertz does not look for allegory and treats these texts in a straight forward manner as objectionable personal opinion and therefore rejects them</p>
<blockquote><p>But the Gemara is more than a mere commentary. In it are sedulously gathered, without any reference to their connection with the Mishnah, whatever utterances had for centuries dropped from the lips of the Masters; whatever Tradition preserved concerning them or their actions; whatever bears directly, or even distantly, upon the great subjects of religion, life, and conduct. In addition, therefore, to legal discussions and enactments on every aspect of Jewish duty, whether it be ceremonial, civic, or moral, it contains homiletical exegesis of Scripture; moral maxims, popular proverbs, prayers, parables, fables, tales; accounts of manners and customs, Jewish and non-Jewish; facts and fancies of science by the learned; Jewish and heathen folklore, and all the wisdom and unwisdom of the unlearned. This vast and complex material occurs throughout the Gemara, as the name of an author, a casual quotation from Scripture, or some other accident in thought or style started a new association in ideas.</p>
<p>HALACHAH AND HAGGADAH<br />
The Talmud itself classifies its component elements either as Halachah or Haggadah. <a href="http://http/www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5140-deutsch-emanuel-oscar-menahem">Emanuel Deutsch</a> describes the one as emanating from the brain, the other from the heart; the one prose, the other poetry; the one carrying with it all those mental faculties that manifest themselves in arguing, investigating, comparing, developing: the other springing from the realms of fancy, of imagination, feeling, humour:</p>
<p>Beautiful old stories,<br />
Tales of angels, fairy legends,<br />
Stilly histories of martyrs,<br />
Festal songs and words of wisdom;<br />
Hyperboles, most quaint it may be,<br />
Yet replete with strength and fire<br />
And faith-how they gleam,<br />
And glow and glitter!<br />
as Heine has it.</p>
<p>We have dogmatical Haggadah, treating of God’s attributes and providence, creation, revelation, Messianic times, and the Hereafter. The historical Haggadah brings traditions and legends concerning the heroes and events in national or universal history, from Adam to Alexander of Macedon, Titus and Hadrian. It is legend pure and simple. Its aim is not so much to give the facts concerning the righteous and unrighteous makers of history, as the moral that may be pointed from the tales that adorn their honour or dishonour. </p>
<p>That some of the folklore element in the Haggadah, some of the customs depicted or obiter dicta reported, are repugnant to Western taste need not be denied. ‘The greatest fault to be found with those who wrote down such passages. says Schechter, ‘is that they did not observe the wise rule of Dr Johnson who said to Boswell on a certain occasion, “Let us get serious, for there conies a fool”. And the fools unfortunately did come, in the shape of certain Jewish commentators and Christian controversialists, who took as serious things which were only the expression of a momentary impulse. or represented the opinion of sonic isolated individual, or were meant simply as a piece of humorous by-play, calculated to enliven the interest of a languid audience.’ In spite of the fact that the Haggadah contains parables of infinite beauty and enshrines sayings of eternal worth, it must be remembered that the Haggadah consists of mere individual utterances that possess no general and binding authority.<br />

				<p>Many of my readers tell me that they like when I only post one good long post rather than many short ones because they don’t have time for many short posts. Some readers have told me that they flag the posts that they like for later with programs such as read-it-later or they forward it to their e-readers. It worked for me this past season because I spent much of the last three months editing my manuscript and then the proofs. However, I am still weighing how much I should post short notes and clippings. </p>
<p>I still have many un-posted pieces since July. The Oliver Roy post took me half a year to get to it.</p>
<p>Those academics and clergy that want an interview about your books or a guest post, then please let me know. I would be glad to oblige qualified people.  Please don’t be shy. Everyone has enjoyed the process. </p>
<p>From the analytics available:<br />
My readership is in the places that one would expect: Boston, Baltimore, Evanston, SF, D.C., LA, Miami, Philadelphia, San Diego, Cleveland, Hartford and Atlanta. I have a strong and consistent readership with an IP # in <strong>Council Bluffs, IA.</strong> If you are from that area and a regular reader, then can you please tell me what Jewish or Christian groups are my readers in IA?  I have regular readers in Dallas-Plano, a town that I have not visited the Jewish community and don’t have any personal friends there. Also a solid contingent in Omaha.</p>
<p>I have more readers with Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan IP addresses than Jerusalem. </p>
<p>According to the analytics, my readership for the first two years was mainly people with graduate degrees and good incomes. In the late Fall, I have gained a demographic without degrees. Hmm.</p>
<p>I gained many new readers with the Carr interview. Welcome.</p>
<p>I just got this week a Samsung Tablet- if anyone knows any good apps to download tell me. </p>
<p>I lost the most readers, feed readers, and subscribers with my review of two works of scholarship on <a href="../../../../2011/11/28/the-hasidic-tale-revisited/index.html">Hasidic Tales</a>. I am surprised that about that. Of all the things that I covered, that Hasidic Tales are not real was a breaking point!?</p>
<p>If you are planning on buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judaism-World-Religions-Encountering-Christianity/dp/0230103693/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">my next book <em>Judaism and World Religions</em> </a>, it will be printed in about 4-5 weeks and officially published mid-March. The price will drop greatly for the pre-publication version, but you have price-guarantee from Amazon.</p>
