				<div class="entry-content">
				<p> After the second intifada, I was in Israel for a round of conferences, and as usual I buy the various local Hebrew papers for Shabbat. In one of the papers, there was a write up of a young poet Eliaz Cohen (b. 1972) of Kibbutz Kfar Etzion, a student of Rav Druckman, who wrote poetry. The article emphasized his then <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hear,+O+Lord+%28Prayer+for+the+Days+of+Awe%29.-a0205465050">new poem Shema Adonai,</a> which is a lament and proclamation to God that He is bound to the people Israel even as its blood is shed in the bombings. The article noted how the poem was read in some synagogues that year because it captured the mood of the intifada, that God should remember the committment of his people. The article also mentioned his early work <em>Nigi&#8217;ot Rishonot</em> (2000) on the tension, desire and distance of observing the laws of Niddah. I was hooked and started collecting his works, learning about the unavailability of contemporary Israeli poetry in America, and which select Israeli book stores carry new poetry. So, I was delighted when I received notice that a volume of his poems translated into English was about to appear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hear-Lord-Poems-Disturbances-2000-2009/dp/1592643132/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293126329&amp;sr=8-1">Hear O Lord: Poems from the Disturbances of 2000-2009  (Toby Press, 2011).</a></p>
<p>Eliaz Cohen is part of a new generation of religious poetry writers. When the New Religious Zionists turned in the 1990&#8217;s toward individualism and the self they emphasized creative writing, poetry, and film. Think of the products of the Maaleh film school. Creative writing is considered a religious activity for the religious Zionists since poetry comes from the Jewish soul. This romantic individualism is even acceptable in many Charedi Leumi circles and among settlement hilltop youth. Rav Shagar z”l includes among his disciples several poets. However, self-expression in the back of beis medrash is not the same as good poetry. Eliaz Cohen has honed his skills to excellence against Yehuda Amichai and Mahmoud Darwish, Uri Zvi Greenberg and unnamed collections of American free verse. He is an editor of the &#8220;Mashiv Haru&#8217;ach&#8221; journal of poetry and author of four published collections of poetry.Cohen was the recipient of the &#8220;Prime Minister&#8221;s Award&#8221; for literature in 2006  </p>
<p>Cohen is a second generation settler and committed to Jews living in the entire Biblical land. But wants to do it, seemingly integrated into bi-national landscape. He has an entire cycle of poems on the pain of the disengagement from Azza and imagines his own Kfar Etzion being evacuated. He dreams about reserve duty and the Utopian or apocalyptic life in the settlements, consisting of Palestinian refugee camps, suicide bombers, dangerous missions, and an elusive hope for peace. He stresses his knowledge of Arabic and interconnections with Palestinians</p>
<p>Cohen uses the language of Biblical verses, midrash, and the liturgy stretching them to new contemporary usages. Cohen emphasizes the commonplace tragedy amidst the cycle of life. He sees the transitory nature of things that seem permanent and which the transitory nature is itself permanent.  He has a series actually called <em>“Poems written in Sand”</em> capturing  the ephemeral quality of life in Israel. He rewrites classic Israeli songs like <em>Bashanah Haba&#8217;ah</em>  and <em>Eli, Eli she-lo yiga-mer le&#8217;-olam</em> into meditations on the transitory nature of things. The Hebrew poems are well served by the translator,Larry Barak, especially the addition of the adjectival richness of English. </p>
<p>Here are three stanzas of a three page poem about the pain and loss of army duty in Lebanon</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>With Me From Lebanon</strong><br />
(a memorial poem)</p>
<p>Every one has his own Lebanon<br />
a handsome dead soldier carried on my shoulders<br />
I brought<br />
with me from Lebanon.<br />
His names mumble to me I do not want to remember<br />
his face</p>
<p>why has your face darkened Lebanon the dawn does not rise caught<br />
in the fog lowering a curtain on memory, a heretic flash.<br />
Yossi.<br />
Sitting in a patrol jeep long flexible legs gathered to<br />
the deer-like body of a good Ashdod boy.<br />
Doing a radio check with God.<br />
God come in, over.<br />
After havdalah he makes me coffee. Infantry instant.<br />
The difference an instant makes?!<br />
Yossi.</p>
<p>All night the fire burned consuming the cedars of Lebanon<br />
identifying Danoch by the white teeth of his smile</p></blockquote>
<p>This one came out the day of the bombing of a Passover Seder in 2002 and became emblematic of the event.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A Palestinian Passover</strong><br />
Until when will the evil not pass over our homes<br />
look, we have already anointed the entrance with blood<br />
each man enwrapped in his ancestral home, we cried out<br />
in human silence</p>
<p>look, our four cups are filled<br />
with flushed boiling wine<br />
our tongues have become tongues of fire<br />
like a slaughtered lamb</p>
<p>if our head is also bowed – and sadness surrounds us<br />
let us flare up:<br />
lush Jews burn well<br />
and what will remain of us until the morning?<br />
An empty chair. In the courtyard of the church of the dead messiah<br />
waits for the Rais to be released<br />
to come and redeem<br />
I see him as before, Ishmael mocking<br />
on that night<br />
there is no house in the holy land where there is not<br />
now he adds another measure<br />
to the bowl of blood<br />
soon will be baked the bread of great affliction<br />
of both nations</p>
<p>This poem appeared in the holiday supplement of the newspaper “Makor Rishon” which came out on Passover Eve 2002. On that night the horrendous Seder night terrorist attack at the Park Hotel in Netanya took place. Less than 48 hours later I was on a  tank preparing for battle in Nablus.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this one, as in many of his other poems, we see Cohen wanting to be like his role model Amichai capturing the tension between the natural and the historical memory. A bloody universalism bespeaking religious symbolism tussling with the beauty of life. </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Snow</strong><br />
Snow on bleeding Jerusalem<br />
as though bandaging her wounds<br />
all rests in tranquility now<br />
filling the cracks of yearning in the Wall<br />
children in your streets, Jerusalem<br />
the sons of Isaac and Ishmael<br />
are staging white wars<br />
(and their blows are soft)<br />
even the pigeons are hurrying today<br />
cooing because they have found new footprints<br />
on the way leading up to the Gate of Mercy</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure that I need him to be Amichai since I already have Amichai. Instead,  I need him to expand the language of religious Jews. To open up new religious insights via Midrash or human experience. I did not include excerpts from his long Midrashic poems, which would not work well in this terse blog format. But here is his rereading of Abraham covenant of the pieces with God. These are the exquisite pieces that easily translate into class discussion of modern midrash.</p>
<blockquote><p>Among the fragments of the bus and your burnt<br />
Jews I make a covenant with you saying:<br />
to your seed you gave, your seed who shall be counted and numbered<br />
according to the multitude of suffering and wrath<br />
like stars ignited before their fall<br />
(O who will be able to bear the wish)<br />
to your seed now an old man forgetting his glasses<br />
(which are on his chest or his forehead)<br />
and unable to return to the agreement or to<br />
those words of the play<br />
Among the fragments of the bus I make a covenant with you saying:<br />
do not slaughter the bird</p></blockquote>
<p>This next poem Ultrasound is closer to his poems from <em>Negiot Rishonot</em>, Cohen uses the Biblical imagery from Exodus to apply to a very personal situation. I think he captures well the way religious imagery actually enters the minds of young couples fresh from Yeshiva when starting life.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ultrasound</strong><br />
“And all the people saw the sounds”<br />
look, we do too: a tiny heart dancing in red and blue<br />
the spine a pearl necklace<br />
(or sun rays)<br />
five fingers searching<br />
and five more<br />
the sex organ is hidden<br />
(in any case we didn’t want to know)<br />
something is trembling inside us<br />
wanting but unable to touch</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, the sort of poems where he becomes personal about life, love, and poetry.</p>
<blockquote><p>And at night<br />
I hide poems in the secret parts of your body<br />
(like notes in the Wall)<br />
a breeze caresses us healing limbs weary<br />
from labor and pregnancy.<br />
Soon it will be morning<br />
the children will come in under the covers<br />
and find the poems</p></blockquote>
<p>From<a href="http://http/www.jafi.org.il/NR/exeres/7EEA7E09-976F-4A40-8A02-8B48B18A581B"> an Haaretz interview,</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Eliaz Cohen was 7 years old when his family moved from Petah Tikva to Elkana in western Samaria. He later studied at the Or Etzion hesder yeshiva under Rabbi Haim Druckman. For nine years, he has been leading creative writing workshops in Gush Etzion and for the past four years has also been working as a social worker in various institutions. His first books of poetry caused an uproar. &#8220;Mehumashim&#8221; (&#8220;Pentagons&#8221;), published by Tammuz, was essentially constructed as an encounter between his personal biography and the weekly Torah portions.</p>
<p>His second book, &#8220;Negi&#8217;ot Rishonot&#8221; (&#8220;First Touches&#8221;), contained an erotic tension that some of the religious public found difficult to digest, while his most recent book, &#8220;Shema Adonai &#8211; Poems from the Events of 5761-5764,&#8221; has been interpreted in part as an alternative prayer to the traditional prayers. For example, Cohen offers a version of the familiar &#8220;Travelers&#8217; Prayer&#8221; written in the singular instead of the plural. In this book, Cohen also holds a kind of dialogue with God, a dialogue that contains a broad spectrum of emotions, including, at times, defiance and anger. After the book was published, Cohen lost his job as a social worker in one of the well-known ultra-Orthodox boarding schools in Jerusalem&#8217;s Geula neighborhood.</p>
<p>From the start, Eliaz Cohen and his colleagues were banned from some of the yeshivas, but their pioneering work paved the way for others who wished to express themselves in this manner. Cohen was moved to write &#8220;Hazmana Lebekhi&#8221; (&#8220;Invitation to Cry&#8221;) out of &#8220;existential anxiety,&#8221; he says. Some of his relatives personally experienced the fall of Gush Etzion in 1948. He says that, in light of the anticipated evacuation, this poem and other such poems by him and his colleagues are filling a fundamental void in Israeli culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a pathology in this culture, that turns its back on everything that is supposed to be derived from the Jewish fate,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It has directed all of this repressed pain toward identification with the other, with the Palestinian who is perceived as a victim, who is a product of our story. I also see the direct relation between our independence and their nakba. The question is how much you allow yourself to undermine your narrative. I long for the day when the ruling elite in our culture will show the same openness toward us as we have shown toward it, both in the last issue of Meshiv Haruah about the disengagement, and in previous issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, playwrights, poets and cultural people have scolded us: `You&#8217;re settlers! How dare you write poetry after you&#8217;ve devoured two Palestinians for dinner?'&#8221; Cohen says. &#8220;As they see it, there couldn&#8217;t possibly be any art coming from the right, since we&#8217;re busy killing Palestinians all day long. I&#8217;m purposely exaggerating, but this is definitely the feeling that has been blowing our way for years. As I see it, when my friends and I write about a settler who is experiencing existential distress, whose friends are being killed, who loses almost his whole family and is now about to be evacuated, it&#8217;s more authentic than a famous poet who tosses a sock filled with money and medicines over the separation fence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<p>Since everyone was more interested in חֲנֻכָּה‎, than Halakhah or Kabbalah, here is the chart. I started with all 13 possible spelling and kept the ones that moved off the bottom axis. Here we have two major contenders since the 1930&#8217;s. No major change from the EJ in the 1970&#8217;s. The question is what happened in 1930 to change the preferred spelling from Ch to H. And what happened to make Channukah with two n&#8217;s the preferred spelling of the 1940&#8217;s. Click on Chart to enlarge.</p>

				<p>Here is a history of how to spell קבלה. Notice the changes of the spelling and recent vintage of our current spelling of kabbalah. Most spell checks still use cabala. It seems that the publication of the Encyclopedia Judaica in 1971-2 changed the spelling to kabbalah. What other words did the EJ change? Qabbalah has still not caught on and cabbala has declined. Also notice the interest in the esotericism of the cabbala as a subject between 1810-1840. Click on the chart to enlarge.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/sichot71/12-71vayechi-asara.htm">VBM just translated</a> one of the important interviews with Rav Amital. The Hebrew original was done in 2007 for Yad Vashem.</p>
<p>Here are some selections,<a href="http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/sichot71/12-71vayechi-asara.htm"> the full version is here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Religious Life During the Holocaust and After: An Interview with Rabbi Yehuda Amital</strong></p>
<p>On Yom Kippur eve we received orders to go back..<br />
 Meanwhile the shooting was intensifying, to the point where the German soldiers guarding us ran away, because they were afraid that the Russians would capture them. And so we remained behind, and we got to the Jewish Community building, to the building where I had lived with my parents. We entered the cellar on Yom Kippur eve. We prayed on Yom Kippur in the dark. We had one machzor with us; one person read the prayers aloud, and thus we prayed with a minyan.</p>
<p><strong> My whole concept of prayer comes from there. </strong>I saw people – fathers of children, men who had wives – they were alone, knowing that their families had been taken, but they didn’t know to where. And I said to myself, “How is it possible to pray?” We knew before then that the foundation of prayer is gratitude towards God. I said, “What gratitude? People are sitting here without parents, without children.” So I reached the conclusion – which I published later on – that service of God cannot be based on gratitude; there is something beyond that. “Though He slays me, I shall trust in Him” (Iyov 13:15). That is a higher level. That understanding was strongly imprinted in me then.<br />
<strong><br />
Did you have religious crisis points?</strong><br />
 I can’t speak of crisis points. One lives in crises all the time. For me, every festival is problematic. On Simchat Torah, for example, I would speak at the yeshiva about the Holocaust [because it was the day of my liberation]; I couldn’t let Simchat Torah go by without mentioning the Holocaust. I spoke about it all the time. Every eve of Tish’a be-Av I spoke about it at the yeshiva; the subject occupied me.</p>
<p><strong>Did it also affect your attitude towards prayer?</strong><br />
On the contrary – as Rabbi Yehuda ha-Levi said, “I flee from You – to You.” I have no other option. I need God; without that I’m not able to exist at all. Without this faith I lose everything. But it’s not as people think, that when a Jew is religious then all the problems are solved. There’s no such thing. But I need His closeness. Just as a person cannot be alone, he seeks some intimacy, some anchor. For me, faith in God is that strong anchor.<br />
<strong><br />
What, as you see it, is the place of the Holocaust in our religious world today?</strong><br />
Sometimes I encounter strange phenomena. They interview a religious person who says, “Why were some children killed there in a traffic accident? Because they didn’t observe Shabbat.” I said to him, “Okay, so you have an explanation for that, but why were millions of Jewish children killed? For that you have no explanation. So why are you trying to give a religious explanation? Be quiet.” It upsets me, but what can I do? Sometimes I keep silent.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe that we have more of a moral obligation than other nations, in the wake of the Holocaust?</strong><br />
I believe that it demands of us greater morality, greater attention to others.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>One of the most important books of Jewish thought in 2008 was <strong>Benjamin Lazier. God Interrupted: Heresy and the European Imagination between the World Wars. Princeton University Press, </strong> (I unfortunately have had it out from the library since early 2009 and they are finally recalling it. This core of this post was actually written ages ago).  It deals with how three Jewish thinkers- Scholem, Jonas, Strauss- dealt with the loss of tradition. They wanted to avoid relativism and instead choose human value through pantheism, gnosticism, neo-platonism, and neo-aristotelianiism.</p>
<p>Why is this high brow book relevant? Why read this long blog post? The reason is the tension between physis and nomos and between relativism and ethical meaning. In 1975, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein wrote his classic &#8220;Is there an ethic outside of halakhah.&#8221; Many have not paid enough attention to the opening second paragraph where Lichtenstein reclaims the tradition by claiming that we care about nomos, not physis, law not the natural order. In turn, the Reform theologian Rabbi Eugene Borowitz complained about the counter-cultural centurions at the door and wrote that Reform needs its own ethical moment within nomos. Most of the recent discussions, therefore, in all three movements have been about nomos, for example medical ethics is done as a legal question.</p>
<p>Now, this year the hot book is Arthur Green&#8217;s <em>Radical Judaism</em> with its defense of pantheism. Most of the criticism of the book has been sociological or the invoking of nomos against Green&#8217;s physis. However, if there is going to be a serious response, then it must directly tackle the current quest for physis. The response must directly deal with the issues of those who feel that nomos is not the answer. One can either find a new defense of nomos for the next generation or find a more traditional form of physis. Saadyah, Bahye, Cordovero and Rav Kook among many others are all physis in that their Judaism is part of the natural order. Should one use one of those for a theology? Alternately, one of the followers of Hans Jonas is Jewish thinker Leon Kass, who rejects stem cell research as an affront to the natural order. Are people looking to become natural in that the law has turned out to not offer ethics? or should one respond to Green with Neo-Aristotelianism, or with Levinas? People want to look into their hearts, not to nomos, where the &#8220;deepest depths&#8221; are to be treated as the holiest. </p>
<p>I did not post Lazier to discuss the implications for Green, rather because it offers one of the best expositions and casuistry of the current issues about formulating theology today. My Catholic colleagues are all gaga about the work of the <a href="http://theology.nd.edu/people/all/oregan-cyril/index.shtml">Notra Dame theologian Cyril O&#8217; Regan,</a> one of the leading theologians in the US today, who is writing a massive many volume exposition of modern gnosticism, heresy, and pantheism- in order to come out with a committed Catholic theology at the end. (I already have a draft of a future post on O&#8217;Regan.)Lazier&#8217;s book provides one of the basic interfaces between the Jewish heresies and the potential for a response. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=24106">The Paradoxes of Secular Heresy</a> by Anna Yeatman<br />
In this wonderful, erudite, and beautifully written book, Benjamin Lazier suggests that the legitimation problem of human artifice assumed a particular urgency and topography in the period between the world wars.  His focus is especially on how three Jewish thinkers&#8211;<strong>Hans Jonas, Leo Strauss, and Gershom Scholem</strong>&#8211;responded to what their contemporary Arendt recognized as the context for Walter Benjamin’s work, <strong>the irreparable loss of authority for tradition,</strong> None of these thinkers wanted to reinstate orthodox Judaism; they could not avoid the modern freedom for human artifice, but they rejected a nihilist-existentialist celebration of the will&#8211;in the absence of God, the human subject is free to will its own being.  They rejected this conclusion because it affirms an utter contingency or arbitrariness.  Such freedom is without any normative orientation or restraint.  It is as though the human subject arrogates to itself a divine creative power without the infinity or universality that is the divine. </p>
<p>In his own way, each of these thinkers insisted that it is vital that the human freedom for artifice not be mistaken as a freedom for self-creation.  To make this insistence, each had to engage and learn from the two heresies of Gnosticism and pantheism that attend the development of the idea of a freedom for human artifice.  These heresies are not new, but in the modern context they acquire the force of being the only possible intellectually cogent narratives of the divine.  In Gnosticism, as already indicated, the divine is invoked in its absence from the world that humans have made, a world of destruction and sin.  In pantheism, the divine is invoked as it inheres within worldly being.  The problem with both heresies is that they are antagonistic to the world&#8211;Gnosticism by indicating the world as derelict in relation to the divine, and pantheism by conflating the divine with the world, thus robbing the world of its own distinctive being.  Jonas offered a philosophical biology, a neo-Aristotelian account of the world as a living organism, as purposive nature.  In so doing, he deliberately presented an alternative to the will to power, a normative reference point in ecology.  Strauss offered a different conception of nature as a normative reference point for human artifice&#8211;this is a neo-Platonic conception of natural right, a conception of justice that precedes human artifice.  Of the three, Scholem was most attracted to a nihilist celebration of a Jewish Zarathustra, a worldly messianism that, like pantheism, conflates human and divine creation.  </p>
<p>However, he argued that “Nietzsche’s famous cry ‘God is dead,’ should have gone up first in a Kabbalistic text warning against the making of a Golem and linking the death of God to the realization of the idea of the Golem” (p. 194).  The myth of the Golem, of course, is a story of the human arrogation of the divine power to create turning into a force for destruction of human beings and their world.  Scholem recognized in Zionist messianism a contemporary Golem, and he argued against it, the tragedy as is now so clear of modern Israel.  </p>
<p>For Lazier, God cannot disappear, for the modern sensibility continues to dwell with and in God, albeit heretically.<br />

<p><strong><br />
Here is another great review</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/exegesis/the-heretical-imperative">The Heretical Imperative by James Chappel</a></p>
<p> “Church Going,” a 1955 poem by Philip Larkin, describes the mix of awkwardness and reverence many of us feel when faced with the monuments of our religious past. The narrator, having removed his cycle clips to visit an old church, asks himself why he continues these debased pilgrimages, which “always end at a loss like this, wondering what to look for.” Larkin’s tourist is unwilling to embrace the rigidities of strict atheism or strict orthodoxy, and lives somewhere in the murky space between the two.</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem is the one diagnosed by Hannah Arendt: the collapse of orthodox religion has not caused us to turn towards the world with the piety and love once accorded God. Benjamin Lazier, in his inspiring and beautifully-written God, Interrupted: Heresy and the European Imagination Between the World Wars (Princeton, 2009), suggests that there can be no simple path between these two forms of reverence. A detour through the long tradition of heresy might be required in order to overcome religion without losing our faith. Through a study of the surprising influence of heretical thought on Hans Jonas, Leo Strauss, and Gershom Scholem—three of the most influential Jewish intellectuals of the twentieth century—Lazier attempts to resuscitate the lost art of heresy, with all its possibilities and danger.</p>
<p>Although European societies were obsessed for centuries with the identification and persecution of heretics, Gnosticism and pantheism refused to die (however many actual heretics were forced to)&#8230;In the tumult of interwar Europe, many attempted to reclaim this absent God through heresy: both Gnosticism and pantheism, the twin rivals of a discredited orthodoxy, reappeared and flourished. Jonas, Strauss, and Scholem, all of whom came to maturity in this postwar period, were indelibly marked by this revival. </p>
<p>Both Jonas and Strauss argued that the horrors of modernity stemmed from God’s disappearance. Against the Gnostics and pantheists, whom they relentlessly attacked, the two German Jews held that the world left behind could be reinvested with the transcendent value that used to be God’s alone. Modernity, in other words, could only be redeemed by filling the God-shaped hole in our society with nature. <strong>In Aristotelian terms, they see physis as an antidote to nomos.</strong> We need, that is, to understand nature differently: not merely as “that which surrounds us,” but as a metaphysical and ethical order that sets limits to human activity—limits that we are manifestly incapable of setting for ourselves.</p>
<p>For Jonas, the modern worldview was tainted with Gnosticism: we treat the earth, and one another, with such consummate lack of care because, in the absence of God, living things appear to us as mere matter to be used and abused at our convenience. Once we stop seeing nature as a stage for God’s creation, and God’s order, everything is permitted (to quote another famous heretic). From this insight he developed a robust philosophical biology and environmental ethics, premised on the final overcoming of the Gnostic heresy. </p>
<p>When we encounter the world, Scholem suggests, we are not faced with the bare nothing of the Gnostics or the flaccid everything of the pantheists; instead, we are faced with a unique something that is autonomous from God yet shot through with traces of its divine origin. Only a gap between God and world allows us the space to develop autonomously as ethical subjects, but this gap is not absolute: from our all-too-human standpoint, we can still sense God, and we can still glimpse redemption.</p>
<p>it shows us an alternative to strict orthodoxy that does not take the form of shrugging ecumenism. Lazier, it should be clear, is not attempting to found a new orthodoxy. Instead he is unearthing a style of thought and reasoning&#8230;  <strong>This mode of engagement with the religious past replaces confused half-belief with exacting analysis, shaping the shards of exploded traditions into something new instead of leaving them in a mess on the floor</strong>. If the God of orthodoxy has lost his plausibility for many of us—for two-thirds of us, apparently—heretical reasoning allows us a path to piety that does not circle back to a bankrupted past.</p>
<p>To adopt Lazier’s title, the modern predicament is one in which God’s call is “interrupted.” The orthodox solution to this dilemma is to act as though she can still hear the word of God with complete clarity, while the atheist’s solution is to clap her ears against the ever-quieter echoes of past revelation. <strong>The Jewish intellectuals discussed by Lazier present us with a third option: to open our ears to nature, and to one another. The skeptic would argue that a circuitous route through heresy is hardly necessary to arrive at such a banal conclusion; in response, Lazier’s modern heretics would wonder why such a simple resolution was ignored in the tragedies of the twentieth century.</strong> As Scholem put it in a devastating formulation, whose simplicity belies the heretical complexity required to truly defend it: “Develop peacefully, and don’t destroy the world.” <a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/exegesis/the-heretical-imperative">Read the rest here.</a></p></blockquote>

				<p>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888), the important German rabbi, during his time officiating as Chief Rabbi of Oldenberg he published <em>Horeb </em>in 1838, his catechism and definition of Judaism. Help me think through the quote below from Hirsch. Any Rabbinic sources come to mind? I know he wrote statements in Frankfort that differ with these views, but right now I want to help analyze this passage. Anything sound familiar? Anyone develop it further? Thoughts? </p>
<p>Rabbi Hirsch defines idolatry as considering the natural world as separate than God. The world is filled with natural forces and the forces within man, some seen some unseen. One should appreciate that there is a Divine law of nature and God’s providence for human destiny. Human’s are given moral freedom, which can triumph over the tyranny of ruthless power or the bondage to the passions.  Your moral freedom as a gift of God and one must use to it to subordinate to God’s laws for humanity. </p>
<p>The quests for wealth, power, and knowledge are all forms of idolatry in that one does not subject one’s forces to a higher purpose. Idolatry, the treating of anything besides God as absolute, consists of a loss of human dignity not an intellectual mistake. One must beware the idolatrous human bondage of sensuality. Polytheism is thinking you do not have to follow God’s duty and instead one can follow the passions For Rabbi Hirsch, seeing the world as many forces or gods is polytheism, which is avodah zarah.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Rabbi Hirsch portrays the idolatry of Egypt as sensuality, as slavery without freedom, and as the power of mammon and the state. Roman is portrayed as the idolatrous brutality of the state and militarism. </p>
<p>Originally, idolatry meant a false god or a representation of God or gods. From the 17th century onward idolatry moved from its original reference to icons to false attitudes toward life. Most of time, the major forms of polytheism were materialism,  the world of commerce, and sexuality. Henry Moore, the Cambridge Neoplatonist defined idolatry as  polytheism, the multiplicity of sensuality and materialism. According to Voltaire idolatry never happened but there is the polytheism of superstition.  </p>
<p>In the 19th century Wiemar Classicism, polytheism was the worship of nature or man himself and not the higher duties. Schiller&#8217;s <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em> (1795) warns against imagination and sensuality. Man should use his freedom and take charge of his destiny. Already in Schiller’s early <em>Mission of Moses</em> (1789) was “Reason’s victory over those coarser errors assured, and the ideas about the Supreme Being necessarily ennobled. The idea of a universal connection among things must lead necessarily to the conception of a single, Supreme Understanding.”</p>
<p>Here is the definition from Horeb.</p>
<p><em>Both minuth and zenuth lead to idolatry – riotous enjoyment leads to it directly; denial and misrepresentation of God usually over the bridge of pleasure.<br />
And if then, in the embrace of sensuality, you have stripped yourself of everything spiritual, no longer retaining any feeling for the Divine, you will yourself become aware in your impulses of your feebleness, your instability, your inconstancy in pleasure, and you will fall prostrate before every creature that provides you with enjoyment and itself seems to you so noble and so everlasting in its enjoyment.<br />
You can also reach idolatry, or rather polytheism, directly through the eye and the understanding of the senses, if Torah does not reveal to you the One and Only God; for with your physical eye and understanding you behold only particular beings and activities, but not the Invisible One with his dominating law. You see only gods, not God. This is avodah zarah.  </p>
<p>You see on every side active forces and their carriers in Nature, elements and carriers of elements like the sun and the earth and the sea and the air; in the life of peoples, you see Nature, soil, rivers, mountains, and so forth; you see Nature, under the hands of man, raised to a power, and you see men with their wisdom and foolishness, power and weakness, passion and folly, fashioning, destroying and influencing the fate and the life of peoples; and an unseen force that holds sway over destiny and life. And in your own life you see the spiritual and the animal in you; you see yourself as a creative force, bestowing a blessing or a curse on everything around you.  </p>
<p>But nothing of all this exists or acts by its own power or its own will. Nothing of all this is a god; all of it is created, the servant of the One all-ruling and omnipresent God. In Nature you see God’s law hold sway; in the life of peoples God’s providence supreme; in yourself a strength sent from God. You yourself, as far as your body in concerned, are subject to the laws of Nature. You enjoy your moral freedom only as a free and loving gift of the Omnipotent, and with that freedom of will you are called upon to subordinate yourself to the universal law as God’s first servant. That much you have learnt. </p>
<p>What you have learnt, however…you must recognize nothing as God apart from this universal sway of God: ‘you shall have nothing alongside his omnipresent and all-pervading dominion.’.</p>
<p>Beware lest, instead of building your material life of God alone, you base it on wealth or power or knowledge or cunning or the like. If you do any of these things, you sin against the law: ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.’ </p>
<p>Nor is this idolatry merely an error, a mistaking of falsehood for truth. In that case, it would be simply an intellectual mistake, a delusion, deplorable indeed, but, even at the worst, not the worst that might happen….But this is not the case. As soon as you set anything else beside God as God, and still more as your God, forthwith human dignity, purity and uprightness fall to the ground, the fabric of your life goes to pieces.  </em></p>
<p>The only people who still speak like this are those influenced by Marxism: Erich Fromm (he was also a Hirschian) Herbert Marcuse, or Cornell West. Old time Christian Fundamentalists and left wing Muslim Marxists also speak like Rabbi Hirsch. Centrist Orthodoxy seemingly accepts the many gods of mammon, hedonism, militarism, degrees, self-fulfillment, and the professional drive to succeed.   </p>

				<p>After John Lennon was killed in 1980, there was a massive public mourning in Central Park. All Tuesday and Wednesday there was an immense gathering in the park of people crying, wailing and flailing over Lennon’s death. </p>
<p>That Wednesday night, Rav Soloveitchik gave a weekly parashah shiur in Furst 501.  The topic was the deaths of Jacob and Joseph in Egypt.<br />
Rav Soloveitchik set up the Biblical verses to discuss the topic of the mourning laws, in which he emphasized how the Egyptian mourning practices of embalming and the encrypting process was not permitted according to teachings of the halakhah. </p>
<p>He then said: “This [the Egyptian practice] is a case of going to extreme in mourning just like the people are now doing for John Lennon.” In the audience, this elicited an outburst of chuckles, murmuring, and moving chairs closer. When everything quieted down, he continued:</p>
<p>“How do I know from Lennon? You are surprised I know from Lennon. Well, I know Lenin- no one can forget Vladimir Lenin, he was a real troublemaker.[last two words slightly garbled from the murmuring crowd]  So I know about Lennon.”</p>
<p>Rav Soloveitchik followed this by using Jackie Onassis [Kennedy] as the model of the opposite extreme of callousness when after Kennedy was shot she shopped for a hat to wear during mourning .</p>
<p>Chabad and Paul McCartney<br />
Since we are speaking about Beatles: The surprise guest at last night’s fundraiser for Rutgers Chabad in New Brunswick was Sir Paul McCartney, who’s apparently dating the daughter of the one of the honorees. h/t <a href="http://njjewishnews.com/justASC/2010/12/08/ladies-and-shluchim-the-beatles/">JustASC</a> and <a href="http://njjewishnews.com/justASC/2010/12/08/i-cant-beleive-it-paul-mccartney/">more details here.</a></p>
