				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>At the turn of the twentieth century, the 19 year old <a href="http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Langer_Jiri">Jiri Langer</a> scandalized his liberal parents by becoming a baal teshuvah to Belz Chassidus. Langer eventually left the Hasidc world to become observant and halakhic but modern Jew. He was a poet, psychologist, Zionist, and Hebraist- as well as a close friend of Kafka. He wrote a superb account of the life of the Hasidic court called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nine-Gates-Jiri-Langer/dp/0227675525/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305745994&amp;sr=8-1">Nine Gates to the Chassidic Mysteries</a></em>; it remains one of the most successful narratives of authentic Chassidic experience. Go read it.</p>
<p>In the new issue of JQR, there is an article called <strong>Coming Out of the Hasidic Closet: Jirˇı´Mordechai Langer (1894–1943) and the Fashioning of Homosexual-Jewish Identity</strong> written by <a href="http://www.lgbtran.org/Papers/HistoryAwardPRHalper.pdf">Shaun Jacob Halper</a> in JQR, Vol. 101, No. 2 (Spring 2011) 189–231. The author who is a Berkeley PHD and graduate of Yeshiva of Flatbush and Yeshivat Har Etzion is attempting to queer Jiri Langer and Hasidism, but the questions asked in the article make the article a queering of Modern Orthodoxy and modern Yeshiva life. The article has extensive notes on many topics. I am not sure of my thoughts on the article yet. It just came out.</p>
<p>Halper notes the break between Jiri and his parents was part of a pattern for that age. But Jiri chose not just poetry and Zionism rejecting their liberal and middle class lives, he also chose Orthodoxy. Langer found immense happiness in the Yeshiva. Later he becomes a Zionist leader and author. Later in his life, he wrote Die Erotik der Kabbala, a work ignored by scholars even though he dealt with the current erotic trends of the kabblah many decades before the current authors.</p>
<p>Langer defends halakhah as based on the need for Jews to bind their overwhelming passions. He offer reasons for the commandments , delineated in the full article, that treat as obvious that women are excluded from the homoerotics of time bound mizvot. Orthodox family life serves to bind passions, however tragic the results.<br />
[Halper is in italics, Jiri Langer himself is in bold]</p>
<blockquote><p>Jirˇı´ Langer’s generation of German-speaking Jews came of age experiencing acute cultural and political disinheritance. During this cultural upheaval they experienced the triple marginalization of their parents (as<br />
German speakers, as Jews, and as liberals), leaving them caught between a declining German liberal culture and the ascendant presence of German vo¨lkisch ideology and Czech nationalism.</p>
<p>Jirˇı´ had come out to his family: he was now a Hasid who, among other things, kept strictly kosher and refused to speak with or look directly at women. Brod described how Jirˇı´’s conversion brushed up against the limits of Prague- Jewish sensibilities; Take his depiction of Hasidic yeshivah students from Die Erotik der Kabbala:</p>
<p><strong><em>As soon as he arrives and it is determined that he is serious, he is greeted with open arms by the ‘‘Chevre’’ [social group]. Soon he finds himself in the middle of a circle of friends, who ‘‘draw near’’ to him through various tenderness and it doesn’t take long to find an older student who has ‘‘the same soul’’ to study with, which he accepts with great joy. How blessed he feels.</em></strong></p>
<p>In this description of homoerotic attachment to the Rebbe, Langer evokes his own autobiographical account of leaving Prague for Belz in the first chapter of his Nine Gates to the Hasidic Mysteries. There he tells that while he later found his years among the Hasidim to be the happiest in his life.</p>
<p>At the time, Langer thought to remain at home for good, frustrated with his unbearable loneliness among the Hasidim, but he was visited one night in the family kitchen by the Belze Rebbe, Yisashar Dov Rokeah, through a prophetic vision, which inspired his return. These autobiographical links explain why Langer spends such a substantial portion of Die Erotik der Kabbala explicating the homoeroticism of the Hasidic world (he devotes an entire chapter to the subject). The following is even more explicit:</p>
<p><strong><em>To understand what kind of love dwelled between the ‘‘yoshvim’’ [talmudic scholars; literally: ‘‘those who sit’’], one only has to step into the beis ha-midrash (house of study), where they are enveloped with their studies. Here sit two young men, with beards just beginning to cover their chins, ‘‘studying’’ assiduously over thick Talmud-folios. The one holds the other byhis beard, looks deep into his eyes, and in this manner explains a complicated Talmud passage. And there, two friends (yedidim) pace around the hall deep in conversation, while embracing one another . (During meals one can see that they always dine out of the same bowl). In the dark corner stand a pair. The younger of the two rests his back against the wall, the elder has the entire frontal part of his body literally pressed against him; they look lovingly in each other’s eyes, but keep still. What could be playing out within their pure souls? They themselves don’t even know.</em></strong></p>
<p>That he experienced (or reimagined his experience) in the Hasidic world as homoerotic is undeniable. Hasidism, as he pictured it, was an incubator of homosexual desire.</p>
<p>Langer’s next metamorphosis into a Zionist activist. Langer became a co-organizer of the first hakhshara (preparation) training program for Zionist emigrants at Mukacheve</p>
<p>How did Langer, a homosexual man affiliated with halakhic Judaism until his death, address the issue of corporeal consummation (i.e., sex) in his work?</p>
<p>In Die Erotik der Kabbala, Langer engages with dominant cultural, psychoanalytic, and sexological discourses on homosexuality, but most directly with the work of Hans Bluher, the major theoretician of the German Wandervogelbewegung … Langer’s intellectual debt to Bluher is profound.</p>
<p>Bluher’s assertion that Jews were historically incapable of homosexuality; legal/religious commitments stunted homosexual expression by channeling Jewish drives exclusively around the interests of the family.</p>
<p>Langer’s commitment to Jewish law undoubtedly ran deep. During one digression (the text is loaded with these), Langer vigorously defends Halakhah against, what was by the 1920s, an oft-repeated attack repeated by Zionists, Haskalah writers, and Jews of many other stripes for decades that Jewish law was oppressive, ascetic, and caused spiritual decay:</p>
<p><strong><em>When the modern Hebrew poet Saul Tschernichovski mocks his people for ‘‘tying up the divine in tefillin’’ he in a way touched on the deep secrets of the commandments. But his jeers are misplaced . The power of tefillin to ‘‘tie up’’ the divine is worthy of the highest admiration. Wrongly, one believes that an unrestrained life, driven extremely in one direction, is a sign of inner strength. On the contrary, every extreme, passionate way of life or ideology is, tragically actually a symptom of spiritual uncertainty or else inner weakness. Finding a happy compromise, as long as one’s energies are not lost, is actually the hardest thing to accomplish. It is always a work of especial spiritual depth and unflinching will to live. Therefore, only the noblest men and races can accomplish it.</em></strong></p>
<p>In defending the law, Langer asserts the capacity of Halakhah to balance extreme passions with a healthy dose of restraint: Halakhah forms a ‘‘happy compromise’’ between compulsive drives and civilizing responsibilities.<br />
But what about the expression of homosexual desire? Is the homosexual offered a ‘‘happy compromise’’ as well in the denial of his emotional and physical satisfaction through sex? Indeed, the problem of homosexuality and Jewish law stretches Langer’s faith to its limits:</p>
<p><strong><em>The official position that emerges works coercively on individuals, in that it requires each individual who seeks to comply with the law to suppress his sexual tendencies and bring himself into harmony with ideas about the preservation of society. The tragedy that this inflicts upon each individual is proportional to his sexual drive.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

				<p>In the nineteen forties and fifties were a great age of interfaith, specifically the creation of the idea of tri-faith America and the idea of a Judeo-Christian synthesis. These ideas let Jews and Catholics enter white America and Protestant America. It also allowed a united stand against bigotry and created an anti-evangelical mission by preaching tolerance door to door. Interfaith dialogue was not about theology but about tolerance. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tri-Faith-America-Catholics-Postwar-Protestant/dp/0195331761/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305730411&amp;sr=1-2">Tri-Faith America by Kevin Schultz</a> shows how postwar Catholics and Jews used the new image to force the country to confront the challenges of pluralism. Should Protestant bibles be allowed on public school grounds? Should Catholic and Jewish fraternities be allowed to exclude Protestants? Should the government be allowed to count Americans by religion? Challenging the image of the conformist 1950s, Schultz describes how Americans were vigorously debating the merits of recognizing pluralism, paving the way for the civil rights movement and leaving an enduring mark on American culture. This book is important for all those trying to understand the interfaith issues of the 1960&#8217;s. (There is much nonsense on the topic on the web and gross misunderstandings).</p>
<blockquote><p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt put it bluntly, if privately, in 1942-the United States was &#8220;a Protestant country,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the Catholics and Jews are here under sufferance.&#8221;<br />
In Tri-Faith America, Kevin Schultz explains how the United States left behind this idea that it was &#8220;a Protestant nation&#8221; and replaced it with a new national image, one premised on the notion that the country was composed of three separate, equally American faiths-Protestants, Catholics, and Jews. Tracing the origins of the tri-faith idea to the early twentieth century, when Catholic and Jewish immigration forced Protestant Social Gospelers to combine forces with Catholic and Jewish relief agencies, Tri-Faith America shows how the tri-faith idea gathered momentum after World War I, promoted by public relations campaigns, interfaith organizations, and the government, to the point where, by the end of World War II and into the early years of the Cold War, the idea was becoming widely accepted, particularly in the armed forces, fraternities, neighborhoods, social organizations, and schools.</p></blockquote>
<p>This book should makes us think about the current interfaith alliances.  When Orthodox Rabbis are friendly with Evangelicals, Mormons, Catholic clergy, and Anglicans, then what does that alliance say about contemporary social needs? It is not theology at stake but a united social front. What is the social front trying to accomplish? Who is it allowing to enter the mainstream? What do they talk about? Not the issues of the 1950&#8217;s rather the issues of our decade such as maintaining faith in a projected secular world, and the need for religious values in the public sphere. What is gained by saying Orthodox Jew, Mormon, and Catholic clergy in one tri-faith breath?</p>
<p>And what is lost? <a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2011/05/tri-faith-america.html">Below is a book review</a> of Kevin Schultz&#8217;s book by Northwestern Professor Chris Beneke who points out the loss of ideas such as distinction and prophecy. When the OU sees itself as one with Mormons and Evangelicals, what is lost from Judaism?</p>
<blockquote><p>Judeo-Catholic-Protestant America&#8212;-Chris Beneke</p>
<p>Kevin Schultz’s Tri-Faith America begins with the story of a priest, a rabbi and two Protestant ministers. It might be the first line of a joke, but it&#8217;s deadly serious. The four chaplains were aboard the U.S.S. Dorchester when it was sunk by a German torpedo in February 1943. They all went down with the ship, prayerfully, arm-in-arm after having given their life jackets to sailors who lacked them.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of the Four Chaplains represented something of a landmark in the history of American religious comity. These men were &#8220;celebrated &#8230; as emblems of the new tri-faith nation.&#8221; Yet, as Schultz shows, Americans were already prepared to appreciate the larger significance of their heroism because of the ecumenical groundwork that had been laid over the previous decade by the anti-prejudice proselytizing of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ), which confronted a revitalized Ku Klux Klan and a swelling, virulent strain of Western antisemitism in the 1920s and 30s.</p>
<p>Schultz&#8217;s assiduous research demonstrates that the NCCJ wasn&#8217;tmerely engaged in a half-ass exercise of holier-than-thou idealism. During WWII alone, the organization sponsored traveling &#8220;tolerance trios&#8221;&#8211;consisting of a rotating roster of priests, rabbis, and Protestant ministers&#8211;who visited nearly 800 military installations and addressed 9 million Americans. This was missionary work on a par with the massive evangelizing and Bible distribution efforts undertaken by American Protestants during the Civil War.</p>
<p>In the early postwar period, such everyday features of American culture as films, manners, and educational programming were shaped by the tri-faith model that the NCCJ had so carefully cultivated. Postwar liberalism was in turn infused with the mostly tolerant and religiously derived moral imperative that went by the name of the &#8220;Judeo-Christian tradition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this somewhat narrow foundation, postwar Americans would adopt broader conceptions of tolerance that included a larger range of religious groups. Religious bigotry and discrimination certainly didn&#8217;t disappear, but they were largely driven from public life by the early 1960s. Though groups such as the NCCJ proved slow to promote civil rights for African Americans, the trope of inclusion that they popularized resonated throughout the 1960s. Meanwhile, before the Judeo-Christian tradition was appropriated by the Religious Right in the 1970s, it was employed by Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders to discredit racist institutions and policies in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>There were deep, intangible costs accompanying the triumph of the tri-faith ideal, which Schultz details. Among them was the loss of communal identity by Jews, Catholics, and Protestants. Also endangered were some of the vibrant, distinctive traditions within each of these larger faith categories. Prophecy withered as ecumenism bloomed.</p>
<p>Still, Schultz provides us with an unapologetically progressive account. He makes clear how profoundly important religious differences were to early twentieth-century Americans and how tirelessly some worked to transcend, or at least mediate, them. Tri-Faith America gives religious tolerance its due as a crucial component of postwar liberalism. In this, it represents a sharp rebuke to the fashionable idea that American religious freedom and religious tolerance have been little more than subtle exercises in coercion</p></blockquote>

				<p>Three weeks ago I posted an interview with Mark Paredes at <a href="../../../../2011/04/27/mormons-and-orthodox-judaism-part-ii/index.html">Mormons and Orthodox Judaism Part II</a>. In turn, Mark posted selections from my post <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/jews_and_mormons/item/interview_with_a_rabbi_on_lds-orthodox_dialogue_39110430/#comments">at his blog, which elicited comments. </a> I am now posted a short interchange from his comments because of an analysis of what the Book of Mormon says about Jews and how contemporary Mormons explains their texts. </p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Paredes, you really are to be commended for promoting positive dialogue between Jews and our Latter Day Saint neighbors. </p>
<p>But Latter Day Saint scripture leaves no room for ambiguity on this topic, making the relationship between Mormonism and the Jewish People unique indeed:<br />
Second Book of Nephi, Chapter 10, Verse 3: “Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ—for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name—should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him—for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.”</p>
<p>Here we read in plain (Latter Day Saint) scripture that the Jews were the “more wicked part of the world” and that they had the unmitigated chutzpah to “crucify their God”! [exclamation point added] The scary thing is that I seriously doubt the general level of morality of Jews in Jesus’ time was any different than that of Jews today—we’re remarkably consistent—thus potentially keeping us among the more wicked part of the world. The only consolation I find is that (thank G-d) the Christian world has not incorporated Latter Day Saint scripture into its official canon. Otherwise, there would have been absolute carte blanche to do to the Jews what they will. You can’t kill G-d, and hope to get away with it.<br />

<p>Gavriel:<br />
Thanks so much for your comment and for your readership. I believe that the following passage of scripture from the Book of Mormon is both better known and more representative of LDS feelings towards Jews, whom they have always respected and honored. Remember that Nephi lived around the time of Jeremiah, who had plenty to say about the Jews’ immorality and wickedness in his time. I have never heard the passage you cited used in any way to defame Jews.<br />
2 Nephi 29:3-14: And because my words shall hiss forth—many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.<br />
4But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?<br />
5O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.<br />
6Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews? [7-11 edited out for posting]</p>
<p>12For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.<br />
13And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.<br />
14And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.<br />
Comment by Mark Paredes on 5/03/11 at 4:07 pm </p>
<p>Mark:<br />
It was nice to read your thoughtful response to my comment. I can affirm that I have never heard a Latter Day Saint use any scriptural source – be it LDS-derived, or otherwise, to disparage Jews. The Latter Day Saints that I have encountered in my lifetime are among the most Philo-semitic people I’ve ever known. I completed my undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and my experience there as a Jew in the midst of a predominantly LDS population was 99.9% positive. </p>
<p>I find the way that Latter Day Saints live their religion to be a marvel, especially when one considers that LDS scripture contains such unique precepts as G-d meting out dark skin color as a form of punishment (for native peoples of the Western Hemisphere), or His withholding of earthly spiritual opportunities as punishment for errors committed prior to being born (in the case of black Africans). In the hands of a people less inclined toward genuine kindness and hospitality, these precepts could become the seeds of terrible hatred.</p>
<p>What actually prompted me to comment on this blog entry, and the response to Question No. 6 in particular, was the statement made regarding the Talmud. I found what was said to be unfairly dismissive (though I don’t believe you intended to come across as disrespectful of something so fundamental to Judaism). My initial comment didn’t address the Talmud statement because I was reaching back further, searching for some underlying motive for making a statement such as this. Perhaps a people considered to be so wicked as to have killed G-d Himself, would also be considered more inclined to quarrel pointlessly about scriptural interpretation?  </p>
<p>I’m about as unqualified as they come when it comes to Talmud scholarship, so here’s my take as a regular Yid: without the combination of the written Torah, and the Oral Torah (with its exhaustive exploration, or “quarreling” as you call it) recorded in the Talmud, I doubt we’d be having this exchange – the Jewish People would have vanished a thousand years ago, through conversion and complete assimilation.<br />
Personally, I think a Rabbi from the Orthodox community would be better prepared to go into the Talmud with you in greater depth.<br />
Comment by Gavriel Abrams on 5/03/11 at 7:47 pm </p>
<p>Gavriel &#8211; In a few instances in the Book of Mormon, when people collectively sinned against God, He cursed them with estrangement from Him. In order to prevent righteous people living at that time from mingling with them, He caused them to have dark skins. Does this mean that Mormons believe that people with dark skin are cursed? No, it does not. It means that for those peoples in those specific time periods living in a specific place, there needed to be a separation between people who were cursed and people who were not. However, once again, the curse was not dark skin, but estrangement from God.  </p>
<p>Blacks were not denied the priesthood because of some residual issues from the pre-earth life. This is not an official teaching of the LDS Church. We don’t know why this happened, but I suspect that it was the same reason that the priesthood was denied anciently to everyone but Aaron’s direct male descendants. The reason? Because that’s the way God wanted it to be for reasons known to Him. Mormons believe that everyone living on earth is a child of God, and that we all sided with Him and chose to come to earth and live together. </p>
<p>My comment on the Talmud had nothing to do with killing God, and everything to do with authority. I would welcome the opportunity to continue this dialogue offline.<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Rabbi Arthur Green, Ph.D., Irving Brudnick Professor of Jewish Philosophy and Religion and Rector of the Rabbinical School at Hebrew College, <a href="http://www.huc.edu/newspubs/pressroom/article.php?pressroomid=1795">presented the Graduation address</a> at HUC-JIR/New York&#8217;s Graduation Ceremonies.</p>
<p>Some interesting points from his talk. First, Green gives his sense of nationalism.</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we see ourselves as leaders of the Jewish people.  We believe in ‘am yisra’el, a historic community that proudly bears an ancient national identity, one expressed in culture, language, memory, and attachment to an ancient and now-renewed homeland.  Claims current in some post-Zionist circles that Jewish national identity is a nineteenth-century invention are as inaccurate as they are pernicious.  Anyone who has ever opened a Jewish prayerbook (and indeed that may exclude some who assert these claims) will realize that we have seen ourselves as yisra’el ‘amekha, “Your people Israel,” for a great many centuries.  Reform Judaism did well to rescind its demurral from that consensus many decades ago.  We bear a deep connection to Jews around the world, including the State of Israel, as we do to Jews of past and future generations.</p>
<p>This means that we want to survive as a distinct ethnic as well as religious community.  That will be an uphill struggle in this country, where non-racially defined minorities are unrecognized, where the price of white skin (that most of us still bear, though that is happily changing) has been an expectation of assimilation.  We are an open religious and ethnic community, gladly embracing converts, welcoming them and their children to share fully in our collective national identity.  This means language, text, culture, history, and all the rest, along with religion, the sacred calendar, and the Jewish life-cycle.  To this end I believe that every synagogue needs to become an active bet midrash, house of study, where basic Hebrew, Jewish texts in translation, and great Jewish books, films, and works of art are actively taught, shared, and discussed.  As a Jew deeply committed to prayer, I will nevertheless rejoice when the American synagogue comes to be known first as an active, bustling center of learning, where prayer services are also held on Shabbat, rather than as a temple for prayers on Shabbat, mostly closed on weekdays.  Think about this when you lie down and when you rise up, when you design buildings and when you hire staff.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second after discussing the role of rabbi as pastor, teacher, and halakhic rav, Green discusses the need to be a rebbe and inflame the community with spirituality of what he calls &#8220;the essence of a universalized Hasidic teaching.&#8221; It is quite a relevant list (1) mindfulness of God&#8217;s presence (2) Serve God in all your ways (3) Joy and wholeness-not guilt and bondage (4) The need for an inner life (5) The need to work on oneself.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a neo-Hasidic Jew.  It is the teachings of Hasidism that have kept me at home, choosing to cultivate our Jewish spiritual garden rather than turning elsewhere for sustenance, like so many others of my generation.  Hasidism is a revival movement within Judaism, as distinct from a movement for religious reform.  Revivalists generally are not interested in changing the forms of religion.  It’s just that the spark has gone out of them and needs to be re-lit.  Jews are like knishes, Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav is quoted as saying.  The ingredients are all the same, but I prefer the hot ones.  Since you are New Yorkers, even the non-Jews among you know what a cold knish might taste like.  Reform movements dabbled with changing the forms – let’s start with organ music and sermons in proper German or English, for example.  Let’s all turn to page 23 and rise together.  But somewhere the fire began to go out.  Now we reformers and post-reformers are struggling toward revival.  Fortunately we have the legacy of Hasidism to help us.  I want to summarize <strong>the essence of a universalized Hasidic teaching</strong> as I would adapt it for today, using a few phrases taken directly from the sources, with just brief comment.</p>
<p>1)  Galut ve-ge’ulat ha-da’at.  The true exile is that of the mind.  Mindfulness, making ourselves aware of God’s presence within us and around us is the beginning of redemption.</p>
<p>2) ‘Avodat ha-shem be-khol ha-ofanim.  God needs to be served in every way.  Everything we do, see, encounter in life is an opportunity for serving God.  Do not restrict your Judaism to the synagogue or times of prayer and study.  Live in intimacy with nature, with family, with others you love.  Seek out work in which you find fulfillment; a life, not just a livelihood.  Help others to do the same. In all of these, see the divine presence flowing through and uniting them.  Raise up sparks through all you do.</p>
<p>3)     ‘Ivdu et ha-shem be-simhah. Serve God in joy.  The spiritual life requires wholeness, self-acceptance, freedom.  It must not become a burden or a source of oppression.  Avoid religion based on guilt.  Use spiritual awareness to help people become more free, to be liberated from their own inner forms of bondage.   Y-H-W-H  brought you forth from Egypt to become your God.  That process of becoming never ends, so you have to keep coming out of Egypt.  Make sure your faith is helping you do that, not holding you back from it.</p>
<p>4)     Dirshu et ha-nekudah ha-penimit. Seek out the innermost point.  Religion’s message is that every person can have an inner life.  This requires cultivation, toward which we use the tradition.  Shabbat, prayer, meditation, mitsvot, spiritual friendship and direction, are all tools toward this end.  There is more to life than our profane and over-commercialized surroundings tell us.  The addiction to “success,” the most prevalent drug within our community, can leave you as empty as any other addiction.  Get a life.  The mishkan or dwelling-place of God is there within your heart.  Just take the time and have the courage to open that door.  Always look deeper, beyond the surface – in yourself, in others, in the world, and in the Torah.</p>
<p>5)     Arbetn oif zikh. To be a hasid is to work on yourself.  We are imperfect beings.  That is the way we were made.  God was not happy just being praised by a chorus of angels.  Real flesh-and-blood humans, struggling with temptation, doubt, with the daily struggle to survive, with mortality and all the pain and loss along the way – if these creatures could sing to God, that would really be something!  It’s a beautiful goal, but not an easy one.  It requires work, including honest struggle, every day.  It demands tikkun ha-middot, improving all those qualities that make us human, the same ones that make us potentially God’s image on earth.  Each day we work on doing it a little better – or least not worse.</p>
<p>These are the teachings.  I say to you as I say to myself: Don’t be so afraid of being a rebbe that you avoid sharing them with those around you.  They need to hear them, and they need you to be their bearer.<a href="http://www.huc.edu/newspubs/pressroom/article.php?pressroomid=1795"> Read Full Version Here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a much clearer document than his Radical Judaism and conveys a broader picture of his thought than the book. Any thoughts? Where would someone Centrist Orthodox go for Arbetn oif zikh? Could one have the hectic upper-middle class professional life required by Centrist Orthodoxy and still seek mindfulness of God&#8217;s presence (without resorting to emotionalism and aestheticism)?</p>

				<p>I am back from Poland. Next week I hope to get around to posting some observations about the trip and maybe some pictures. I always mistakenly think that I will be able to continue blogging overseas. I still have to return and finish the discussion of Richard Miller. I am home and working at my computer the upcoming weeks, so expect a larger than usual number of blog posts.</p>
<p>Someone who spent Passover in Crete with the <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2011/04/my-big-fat-greek-pesach.html">many other people who were there</a>, went during Chol HaMoad to visit the cave that is ascribed as the <a href="http://lykaionexcavation.org/about/excavating-at-the-birthplace-of-zeus">mythic birthplace of Zeus.</a></p>
<p>When the person returned to the hotel, one of the Brooklyn Jews asked: <strong>&#8220;Who is Zeus?</strong></p>
<p>What is the cultural literacy of the community. Old time Orthodoxy knew in a nerdy factoid way lots and lots of cultural knowledge and could compete in any college bowl type competition. Has Orthodox cultural literacy changed?  Has it changed the nature of the community? People frame the study of secular studies in terms of value for an adult life and for thought, but what about basic elementary school cultural literacy? E.D. Hirsch, in his 1987 bestseller <em>Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know</em> claimed that cultural literacy is the ability to converse fluently in the idioms, allusions, and informal content that creates and constitutes a dominant culture.  Is Orthodoxy outside of dominant culture and unable to answer basic questions? Does it put them in the same rubric as Snooki of Jersey Shore who cannot answer these basics?<br />
What should be the role of cultural literacy?</p>

				<p>In the winter, we were discussing Rawls and the need for rational universals. <a href="../../../../2010/12/25/ej-and-rawls/index.html">Here is the major post on the topic.</a> Back on January 31, I posted:</p>
<blockquote><p>To continue the discussion of Rawls and the creation of a fair Judaism that does not deny the humanity of others, I will do some posts on Richard B. Miller, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Religion-Liberal-Thought-Columbia-Politics/dp/0231150989"><em>Terror, Religion, and Liberal Thought</em></a> (Columbia UP 2010). So AS and EJ you can have a chance to read it before I post.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I am finally getting to it.  I hope they had a chance to read it.  For advanced warning, I will be discussing later this summer <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holy-Ignorance-Religion-Culture-Columbia/dp/0231701268">Oliver Roy, Holy Ignorance: When Religion and Culture Part Ways </a></em></p>
<p>Miller’s agenda is how not to get caught up in multicultural relativism even as we argue for respect for relgions.  How can we give room for religious beliefs and not justify killing, lying or stealing  as condoned by a certain interpretation of religious law.</p>
<p>This topic is also important for all the events making the newspapers in our community. How should we tell someone in our community that theft from gentiles or cheating to make a living is inappropriate when there are minority voices allowing it. Or how to reject statements  about not selling apartments to gentiles in Israel . Doesn’t multiculturalism mean that I cannot critique their religious view?</p>
<p>I am not interested in the gossip and scandal elements of the crimes and inappropriate statements. I am not looking for the hock or to necessarily criticize anyone.  </p>
<p>I am interested in how to set up the ethical equation.  My question is: How do we express an ethical position without having to give into the rampant religious relativism by those most religious?  If someone says that a position that involves stealing or killing is the true halakhah, then how can we answer their claim that there is no outside  vantage point to judge? Can we formulate halakhic responses to positions that have a moral force? </p>
<p>Miller’s basic answer is that there must always be a fundamental intuitionism as the core of any religious position.  One must have a fundamental acceptance of “Do not kill” and “do not steal” as an intuition or natural starting point. What Saadiah called the rational laws (mizvot sikhliot). If one accepts do not steal as an axiom then no amount of casuistry can overturn it. What Rav Kook called natural morality. Or as Rav Aharon has said repeatedly: “Gezel hagoy (stealing from gentles) should not come down to two opinions in tosfot.” There needs to be a fundamental universal of “Do not steal” as a norm within the system. It takes Miller until chapter three to get to this point. So hold off questions. I am only presenting here the first chapter and parts of the second.</p>
<p>The seven chapters of the book deal with why that fundamental intuition is necessary and sufficient. And in the last four chapters he explains why we do not need all the big guns and many premises and expectations of Rawls, Rorty, Macintyre, Habermas, Taylor and Waltzer.<br />
This will take about three posts to finish, so be patient. </p>
<p><strong>Chapter One &#8211; Indignation</strong><br />
The first chapter expresses the problem of multicultural relativism as a culture of excuse and apology. This approach to culture will not defeat the evil or offer moral standards . (Michael Waltzer) There is a need for feeling of indignation when injustice occurs. </p>
<p>If we value human dignity and respect, if we want a society of justice and equality  then how do we affirm it against multicultural pluralism?</p>
<p>Miller’s first point is that we have to take extreme statements seriously. They become part of our culture and poison the atmosphere. If Bin Laden and his followers are in favor of murder then we have to take it seriously. What we should not do is say that Bin Laden is not really Islamic, so we don’t have to take it seriously.  We should not create false liberal images of Islam or Judaism and then tell people to disregard the extremes, the unethical, and immoral. People follow these extreme positions even if they are not the best textual reading.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we should also not create a firewall between faith and ethics. We should not say whatever religion says is good and that universal ethics like stealing and killing have no place in the discussion. We cannot tell someone to listen faithfully to the shaariah or halakhah and ignore the moral imperatives.</p>
<p>We should not say that stealing and embezzlement is OK because a specific posak said it was OK. </p>
<p>We can acknowledge that Islam and Judaism have civil, economic, and political aspects and we should follow the arbitration and judgment of those systems but when is a position just plain aggressive or immoral?<br />
Miller feels that we are stuck between the rock and hard place of offering a favorable judgment on demand to every religious group based on multicultural tolerance and the liberal ethnocentrism of not allowing religion into the discussion.</p>
<p>Miller ends the chapter by asking: What does it mean to respect others and to offer a universal baseline ethic?  We need both the acceptance of religious systems and offering them the benefit of the doubt as well as a baseline ethic.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2 – Contextualization </strong><br />
In the second chapter Miller is bothered by how contextualizion is used to justify any moral wrong found in a system.  If one goes back to any religious text, one can offer legal, historical, economic, and social explanations for what that immoral sentence was written but it is still on the books. You can justify killing heretics or stealing from gentiles based on a variety of contextualizations but if you then bring up the immoral law with a justification for it in conversation it is relativist or if you justify it for other people it is relativist. </p>
<p>(1) The first form of contextualization that Miller finds fault with is the use of  historical arguments  based on legal and doctrinal precedents to reject the immoral opinion.<br />
For example, a historical approach to the law can claim that Bin laden is not Islamic based on prior sources. He made up new fatwa and makes assumptions not found in earlier sources. So he is not Islamic. Or you can declare the immoral approaches to halakhah as not really Jewish and not really halakhic. </p>
<p>But Miller cries out in his exasperation that telling me that Bin laden is a misuse of Muslim tradition does not deal with moral indignation and resentment of those who suffered an injustice. </p>
<p>Yes we now know from this act of contextualization that extremists have a narrow view of the tradition and ignore the richness of the tradition. <strong>But it makes the extremists guilty of reductionism of tradition rather than a moral crime.</strong><br />
Miller puts his finger directly on the problem. When Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein&#8217;s Responded to the Letter Banning Sale of Homes to Gentiles,<a href="http://kolharav.blogspot.com/2010/12/rabbi-aharon-lichtensteins-response-to.html"> he writes </a></p>
<blockquote><p>This pain stems from the shortcomings that the document manifests in precisely those areas that should have been its strong point. The document speaks in the name Halakha, and its signatories see themselves as its envoys and propagators.</p>
<p>But therein lies the problem; the prohibition of selling homes to gentiles is presented as the exclusive halakhic position in the manner at hand, and the voice that bursts forth from the throats of the signatories is made to sound like the single unequivocal word of God, that is, halakha. Here one asks, is that indeed so? Without a doubt, the position expressed in the letter is based on rabbinic sources and a long halakhic tradition. Yet taken as a whole, the document leaves one with the impression that its conclusions are based on presumptions that characterize a particular—but not exclusive—halakhic approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Miller thinks that Rav Aharon <strong>should not turn this into a problem of reductionism of tradition but he should directly invoke the ethical principles.</strong> There needs to indignation not just regret. Rav Aharon ended his letter “I conclude with what should be self-evident. At stake are key questions that involve meta-halakhic considerations.”  Miller thinks the self-evident should be front and center. (Dont take as a critique of Rav Aharon in any way, rather take this as an example of Miller knowing how these protests sound and wanting the rhetoric to be more direct.)</p>
<p>Why does Miller think this?<br />
First, because laments of reductionism of tradition are not indignation.<br />
Second, it does not place the rejected opinion as off limits. It is not strict and does not offer sufficient limits.<br />
Third, it is much too vague about the moral judgment at core.</p>
<p>2] The second form of misplaced contextualization are economic arguments in which the offending opinion is considered as due to economics and material concerns. They are only doing it out of desperation or need, or social hopelessness, or it was the way they acted in the old country, or they don’t recognize America is a different country. </p>
<p>Miller does not like placing economics over faith especially when they themselves are claiming that their decisions are direct due to religion.  Miller also finds that many amoral religious do not have any social or economic desperation. Many of the criminal Jews are already wealthy.  Economic accounts do not take them at their word.</p>
<p>To be continued in at least two more parts.  Help me think this one through. Is he setting up the problem correctly? I will edit this first part as I gain clarity. Could Rav Aharon have directly and head-on dealt with the ethical and meta-halakhic issues? How is this multicultural relativism moving to  occupy a default position within Orthodoxy?</p>
<p>After the three parts, we can go back to the classic essays like &#8220;Is there an Ethic Outside of Halakha? to see if we have gained any clarity against 21st century multiculturalism.</p>
