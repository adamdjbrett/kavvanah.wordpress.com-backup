					<description><![CDATA[What is says about Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneeerson&#039;s leadership of Chabad is astounding. The way you portray the book makes it more readily understandable how the Rebbe worked and succeeded. I would assume that centrist orthodxy followed his lead albeit maybe by accident. .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ll confine my comments to the question why in Modern Orthodoxy the left and the liberals failed, while the right became a large majority. Reform and secular Jews arrived on average earlier in America than the Orthodox who remained Orthodox. There was a background of mass socialism and labor movement organizing in the period 1870 to 1920, communism in its Stalinist and Trostskyite variations in the 30s and 40s, and anti anti-communism in the 50s, all of  which gave  a progressive slant to the non-Orthodox Jewish community, much less so  with the Orthodox. The same can be said for the Yiddish culture of the left. Not very important. What did count were  the benefits of the New Deal and the welfare state, which in time became accepted as a given. Orthodox Jews voted for Stevenson over Eisenhower not because of a passion for the liberal sensibility, but because Jews were Democrats. So going into the  1967 War there was no strong leftist or liberal-civil rights tradition in MO that could provide a counter force to the right wing politics of the occupation, the Gush and in time the Likud. The darkei noam ways of the Mizrachi movement divorced from any strong attachment to European social democrats disappeared, to be replaced by the Gush and the religious zionists of the Mercaz Harav Kook type. MO Jews who originally had embraced a tepid non-threatening version of Zionism now felt obligated to defend the occupation, which led to a preference for neo-Conservative solutions over more balanced approaches, whether those of Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton. The post 1967  generation went to hesder yeshivas, where even the most liberal were far more to the right  than the American Jewish community at large. Jews were no longer union members, had as you emphasize moved to the suburbs, and distanced themselves from their generally poorer charedi counterparts. Being on the right in foreign policy and in a position to benefit from Republican domestic policies, the transition to becoming an enthusiatic right winger was not difficult. I have some problems with thinking of the American friends of Chevron as the heirs to the hippie movement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.I wonder how going from hippie to right winger works genetically .I read that liberal or conservative tendencies are very much genetically influenced.What you are actually inferring if I understand correctly is that these former hippies have at core remained hippies and just found a different outlet for those urges.
2.What percentage actually moved from left to right?If I had to guess I would say that most liberal Jews remained liberal and a good portion actually radicalized their liberal tendencies.
3.If people in your surrounding can&#039;t fathom Reishit Hochma ,gra,Tanya or the likes that is very sad.It is a spiritual handicap which leads to harsh questions about the spiritual capabilities  of  American Orthodox Jews.]]></description>
