					<description><![CDATA[Note please that in none of these fine old texts is there a woman&#039;s voice discussing how women might be treated, or indeed desire to be treated. Just varieties of how I am supposed to live and define myself with reference to duties to God, husband, father, and sons. As for their part, there&#039;s a set of boundaries as to how horribly they might treat me -- if she does this, do that, but never go so far as the other. 

Between this, the liturgical obsessions with war and fealty to the boss, and the American community&#039;s genuinely miserable response to our own poor -- fear of our recognizing own poor, if you ask me -- I found that even though I had wanted to bring my daughter up going to shul on Shabbos, going to services, I just couldn&#039;t do it. I couldn&#039;t stand next to her and say these words. So we show up late and just hang around with people at the kiddush, just to be with Jews (there aren&#039;t many around here). 

Alan, I&#039;ve been reading this blog with interest, but today I went and searched on the word &quot;women&quot;. And while many posts come up, so far I have not hit one whose main subject is a careful look at why women, specifically, leave Orthodoxy. I&#039;ve already told my own story: the absence of respect for and authority of was obvious and palpable even to a 12-year-old. It&#039;s right there in the design of the shul. (If anyone wants to argue with that, switch: find you a lady rabbi, put the women in the middle on the floor, men, you can go behind the mechitza and in the galleries, and hush you; and the ladies will run things as they will. The very idea makes you crazy, no? And stop sticking your fingers through the holes and distracting the women with orders about what to do. Go home and make lunch, why don&#039;t you.) I expect, though, that women leave for other reasons too, and it would be interesting to hear about that. Nearly all the voices on this blog are male.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan: I am disapointed  that R. Linzer who is a fine and sophisticated  Talmid Hakham is so shockingly slovenly in dealing with Christian belief.

One caveat: The most studied part of Aquinas in the 14th  c.   may have been  his Book  on Sales, but Aquinas&#039; authority derived frnom his position as a theologian, while that of Maimonides, say, derived from his position as a halakhist.]]></description>

R. Cherlow wrote that like a politician (&quot;I&#039;m not joining the fray this time...&quot;) and beats up a straw man - Likud has 7 Religious Zionist MKs, more than Bayit Yehudi and NU together. R. Cherlow knows better than to suggest that Piron joining a secular party is a chiddush, which makes me think that he&#039;s doing little more than campaigning for his buddy.

Back to Piron&#039;s vort, I think he misreads Rufus as asking a question of theodicy (he, after all, assumes Rufus to be some sort of philosopher) - he paraphrases Rufus as saying &quot;how can God allow there to be poor people?&quot; It seems more likely, as you pointed out above, that Rufus&#039;s theological question has a more practical dimension that does not question God&#039;s judgment: if God does not feed these people, it would undermine God&#039;s will to do so.

Fascinating genealogy of the identification of Gehenna with individualist capitalism. I wonder how many Yesh Atid voters know that Piron is a Socialist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re willing to foray across the pond, I&#039;m curious to hear what you think about Shai Piron&#039;s reading of Rufus&#039;s position in BB 10a (and other sources).

Monks? too much medieval history!
A Catholic seminary education in the 21st century is similar to a Jewish seminary education.
First year- Bible, Intro to Theology, Church History, How to perform the sacraments
Year Two- More Bible, Canon Law, Homiletics, Liturgy, Pastoral Psych 
Year Three- More Bible, Ecceisiology, Christian Ethics, Liturgy, Marriage
Year Four -electives, modern theology- lots of practical skills
You usually get to major in one field. If one does not major in theology then usually what Jews think Catholic do as theology is about 2 classes.
The majority of seminarians now come from overseas and do not have the English or general education to major in theology. The Americans come with a background in business or computers. 
According to Fr Boyle, the Vatican librarian In the 14th century, the part of Aquinas that was most studied was the &quot;book of sales and contracts&quot;]]></description>
