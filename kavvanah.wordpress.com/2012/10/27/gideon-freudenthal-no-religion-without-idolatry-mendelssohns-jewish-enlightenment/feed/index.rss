					<description><![CDATA[
&quot;since religion is about symbols that are not immediately reducible to reason, then there can never be a religion without idolatry&quot;

I think the assumption is here that people have a striving which relates to a physical symbol and hence this will always be given to misinterpretation of the immediate symbol.

If the striving is for something which is only one step away from the &#039;world&#039; of the person at hand then maybe this would be a problem. If the striving is for something which is completely outside of the person at hand, however, then I don&#039;t see that this has to be a problem, because the object at hand is taken as a sweetener and clarifier.

The question is, are we locked down to relating to something which is only one step away from what we know, or are we prepared to relate to something before we understand it at all.

Maybe you could relate this to naaseh before nishma.]]></description>

I reviewed Leora&#039;s Idolatry and Representation: The Philosophy of Franz Rosenzweig Reconsidered in AJS Review, 27:1, 165-7, but I can&#039;t recall at all what I said and am not sure if I said anything about aesthetics. About common sense, I think it&#039;s the other way around. Common sense is deeply rooted in aesthetics, as is Mendelssohn&#039;s model of reason (remember, that&#039;s what makes him pre-critical, and pre-Kantian). About aesthetics, I don&#039;t think Mendelssohn was at all cautious or reserved. I wrote about this in the Paul Mendes-Flohr festschrift, a copy of which you can find under the Publications tag at www.jewishphilosophyplace.wordpress.com.

Great point. There seems to be a connection between the rationalist common sense and the caution toward the aesthetic. You ignore the term, but Batnitzky made it a core term in her study of FR. Do you have a critical review of Batnitzky somewhere?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m looking forward to reading Feudenthal&#039;s book and enjoyed Ben&#039;s review. I can&#039;t help but think that the reduction of aesthetics to &quot;idolatry,&quot; whatever that is supposed to mean, is a sad and tired philosophical cliche that we have yet to surpass. In my own writings on aesthetics, in both Mendelssohn and Buber-Rosenzweig, I&#039;ve found it pretty easy and very profitable to ignore the concept of idolatry all together. I mean, I know it&#039;s supposed to make the thought sound &quot;Jewish,&quot; but I&#039;m just not sure.]]></description>
