					<description><![CDATA[First thoughts... (I  would like to get to the full translation when time permits) ...Heinemann strikes me as naive, well-meaning, and constrained by the vicissitudes of his times.  
I think Torah and Talmud, particularly as illuminated by and integrated with Chassidut (primarily Chabad), has a far more nuanced perspective on the perennial challenges of balancing the needs and rights of yachid and klal than Heinemann&#039;s simple conclusions suggest.  I&#039;ll add that he appears to make the same mistake as most neo-classical economists in failing to distinguish between the three factors that produce wealth: (a) land and natural resources (which is what the Biblical verse he cites refers to - &#039;ki Li ha&#039;aretz&#039;) - which do indeed belong by rights to the community and should not be monopolized by individuals; (b) labor, the fruits of which rightly belong to labor; and (c) capital, the fruits (or risks, or losses) of which are rightfully claimed by the capitalist. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reblogged this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewishphilosophyplace.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/2981/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;jewish philosophy place&lt;/a&gt; and commented: 
I really liked this post by Alan about Torah and Socialism. The text by Joseph Heinemann is from 1944, so it has that classical feel to it. As a special treat, Alan linked the entire piece in translation further down under &quot;Read the Rest Here- Heinemann- Torah and Social Order.&quot; I may include it as part of my course this fall on Israel and Israeli Judaism. It&#039;s a nice reminder that religion, Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism do not necessarily have to be reactionary. Or is that just whistling in the wind?

					<description><![CDATA[AIWAC…As is well known the protesters did what they could to stay away from politics and initially refused to provide any suggestions how to solve the housing problems. Netanyahu in response to the protests announced a new housing plan, including significant incentives for contractors who build student, rent controlled or smaller apartments. The plan would allow contractors to purchase land from the state up to 50% cheaper,  would then be obligated to rent out half of their apartments at 30% of their current value, but would be allowed to sell the other half of apartments at a market price. I personally have invested in such type deals when they were available from the FHA, and they ended up wildly profitable. Where we differ is what constitutes socialism. A demand for a welfare net  is not socialism. I wouldn’t call rent control, which admittedly is a last ditch measure, socialist. Nor is public housing. You might argue they are distortions of the outcomes of a perfectly competitive market, but so is the mortgage deduction, accelerated depreciation, differential taxation rates for capital gains and the endless  twists and contortions in legal codes that favor  capital over wages. Socialism is either state ownership of industry or common ownership as in some of the kibbutzim, not spending tax dollars to alleviate some failure of the marketplace.  The problem is that to my knowledge these plans have not been implemented, and today in the current 2012 atmosphere the government feels free to crush the demonstrations before they begin. I am hardly an expert on the inner working of the protest movement, but a cursory look at their web page led me to the following article, http://j14.org.il/articles/32885. Any movement that is happy emulating Northern Europe and the US under Obama are hardly left wing radicals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this. Its worth noting that the prayer book begins with a long meditation on Tzibbur and Yachid thats inflected with German idealism. It also claims that tefillah is egalitarian because we go from Kohanim to a democratized world where we can all pray.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The demonstrations last summer didn’t demand the state nationalize the basic industries or impose even greater taxes for the rich. The demonstrators wanted the state to break up these concentrations of wealth, and use its power to improve the standard of living of the middle class by lowering import duties, selling state land, etc&quot;

ej, I seem to remember the demonstrators arguing for standard socialist solutions (more public housing and rent control, for instance). Many of the pamphlets written by ideologues close to the movement were also very old-school socialist in tone. 

Perhaps you could tell me where and when they said otherwise?

&quot;But Heinemann’s heart is in the right place, and for this alone it is good to be reminded that there was a moment in Orthodoxy where Jews took such issues seriously&quot;

We do, but more and more Orthodox Jews (and non-religious Israeli Jews) have become advocates of the freer markets, breaking monopolies and customs barriers as a better solution for problems. Nevertheless, you&#039;ll still find many Orthodox Jews who support &#039;social justice&#039; such as R. Benny Lau.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heinemann’s remarks have an antiquated feel about them, and in this respect Michael Makovi  has a point. Heinemann doesn’t explain  how a Jewish version of socialism would be more successful than in Russia or Cuba etc.. But Heinemann’s heart is in the right place, and for this alone it is good to be reminded that there was a moment in Orthodoxy where Jews took such issues seriously. There is greater concentration of wealth in Israel today than in the US, the ideological center of wild west- winner take all capitalism. Four families or forty families, depending on who you read, own/control 30%-70% of the basic industries, banks and utilities. These oligarchs use their crony relationships with the banks to leverage their equity many times over. They have  created a system where heads they win, tails the subsidiary declares bankruptcy, and the loss is shifted  elsewhere.  (Take a look at a chart of the  TA stock market, the ETF symbol being EIS, and it becomes apparent something not right is going on.)What happened in Russia happened in Israel, but with much less publicity. The demonstrations last summer  didn’t demand  the state nationalize the basic industries or impose even  greater taxes for the rich. The demonstrators wanted the state to break up these concentrations of wealth, and use its power to improve the standard of living of the middle class by lowering import duties, selling state land, etc. This is not socialism but  creating a better chance for free competition and equal opportunity to flourish. So far the status quo cronyism remains firmly in place, Olmert is still a free man, except for one interesting case, the cellular phone business. May it be the first of many.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I might further note that Rabbis Epstein and Heinemann, as well as Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, display a tendency which we see in non-Jewish moral philosophers as well:

They presume to speak of the morality of markets and economics without actually knowing any economics! John Rawls, for example, is a prime example. See economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe discussing Rawls (Hoppe makes similar remarks in his introduction to Murray Rothbard&#039;s The Ethics of Liberty): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doNpgfxsW14]]></description>
