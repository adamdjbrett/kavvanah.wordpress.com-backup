I dunno about Christian bait - but I agree - significant problems arise when we say something like &quot;Judaism is about the body&quot; because, such as in Boyarin&#039;s writings, it&#039;s a very specific &quot;rabbinic Judaism&quot; - meaning pre-Aristotelian and neo-platonic forms (Halevi, Ibn Rush, Maimonides, Gersonides,  etc.)   To say Judaism disregards the soul ignores post-philosophic thought.  You don&#039;t find that line so tightly drawn in Soloveitchik&#039;s other writings (especially Halakhic man).  There is often a very dualistic sense that relies on medieval Jewish philosophy.]]></description>

It is a great question. His ethical thinking has Hermann Cohen directly in front. He uses the same language and categories. Cohen was anti-Zionist. Two years prior, his Five Addresses used the Religious Zionist Reines. He does not use Reines&#039; ethic which goes back to Seforno and medieval/renaissance categories. He clearly wants a post-Kantian ethic of individuality and responsibility. He had a dialectic between the political and the ethical. Does it work? We know that by the time these lectures became LMF, the political elements are removed. Several scholars have noted that the Rav was a great Zionist leader but not a Zionist thinker, the eternal overrides the temporal. Listening to destiny, to heed the political call of the hour, is located in the self. Buber comes up occasionally in these discussions, but this lecture has large chunks of Cohen.]]></description>

I meant the line about Judaism holding the body more sacred then the soul not the line about the past 2000 yrs. He&#039;s taking the Christian bait there and embracing the body. I wonder what he means by body and how it plays out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If the state does not live up to our values then the entire past 2000 years, the entirety of Jewish history will be reinterpreted in a different light. It will prove to the world that Jews are not better and only did not act wickedly because they did not have a chance.&quot;  - you&#039;re right, great comment, but its drawn directly from Halevi&#039;s Kuzari.

About comment above - you&#039;ll find that Boyarin didn&#039;t simply &#039;do it&#039; but that that theme has lingered in unarticulated forms through many Jewish and non-Jewish discourses.  Boyarin only tried to show that it develops in a sort of back-and-forth with Christian discourse surrounded the body and the spirit.]]></description>

Leibowitz would disagree with most of this. Leibowitz thought that we follow ethics because of Kant and secular ethics- not because of Torah. For him, Torah has no ethic or social theory. For Rav Soloveitchik, the goal was to develop a Torah ethic. This lecture is just one side of the Rav, the next one may be on the parochial and sanctity elements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This excellent post opens so many topics. One thing it doesn&#039;t make explicit, though, is the filiation of the Rav&#039;s version of &quot;What is Man?&#039;  Clearly, the Rav is riffing off of his Neokantian interlocutors. It&#039;d be instructive to compare the Rav to Kristeller, Cassirer and Trinkaus on the innate dignity of man. From AB&#039;s summary it seems like man is valued for his spontaneity and autonomy (Kant), for his adherence to the moral law (Kant) or his status as an ensouled animal (Neokantians reading Ficino). 

A side note: What&#039;s with the reclaiming of carnal israel 40 years before Boyarin did it (&quot;sanctity in Judaism is of the body&quot;)? Jews are all about the body and lets bite the bullet on Paul. That&#039;s a remarkable thought.]]></description>
