					<description><![CDATA[For whatever it&#039;s worth, my father had very warm relations with Oesterreicher - for all I know that may have largely been because of the latter&#039;s being supportive, as I recall, of Israel and Zionism. Oesterreicher co-edited a volume on Jerusalem under the auspices of the now-defunct American Professors for Peace in the Middle East, in which my father was very involved.
(While we&#039;re at it, it&#039;s sometimes occurred to me that there may be an interesting paper or part of an MA thesis to be done on APPME as an admittedly minor but perhaps illustrative way-station en route to the ideological fissures of today.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Larry, that is correct. He was suspect and critiqued by the Jewish community, in the press, and by Jewish thinkers. Connelly&#039;s point is that nevertheless he was using Theme&#039;s words.  The book was based on his writings in Paris 47-52. He arrived in the US in 52. His 1953 writings already sound different. He never wrote like that again but he never really regained anyone&#039;s trust. The Forward did not ask me what I thought of the book but how people will relate to these &quot;new&quot; revelations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oesterreicher&#039;s book of 1952,Walls Are Crumbling: Seven Jewish Philosophers Discover Christ  was clearly conversionary. Note the date, however. It was the subject to  an extremely  harsh review by Trude Weiss Rosmarin&#039;s in her journal The Jewish Spectator-- I don&#039;t remember when. (A very interesting journal, by the way. It would be  good subject for a thesis.) Oesterreicher wrote a reply and Weiss Rosmarin an even sharper response. It still resonates in my memory.]]></description>
