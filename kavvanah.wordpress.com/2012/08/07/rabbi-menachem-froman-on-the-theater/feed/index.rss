					<description><![CDATA[I think Nachum&#039;s last sentence is close to truth.  When I was a young man in yeshiva, Rav Froman would give shiurim on Rav Kook.  Orot Hateshuvah, Orot, other writings.  He was always able to flesh out the already apparent transcendence in the Rav&#039;s writings.  From afar, it appears to me that tendency for both transcendence but also embracing or encompassing a larger reality became more and more his inclination and direction.  This is, of course, part of why he went to Tekoah to be the rav of a mixed community and to try and create a more encompassing reality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems that for R. Froman the power of the theater lies in its power to convey universal truths about the human condition. Completely absent is the focus on individual expression that is so in vogue in the daati world today. There seems to be no emphasis on individual creativity as there is in say Rav Shagar&#039;s thought. 
I don&#039;t know have much a background in R. Froman&#039;s ideas so perhaps I am stating the obvious but as I read the rest of the interview, I was struck by the apparent influence of Rav Ashlag&#039;s thought. Perhaps R. Froman represents the radicalism of a previous generation.]]></description>
