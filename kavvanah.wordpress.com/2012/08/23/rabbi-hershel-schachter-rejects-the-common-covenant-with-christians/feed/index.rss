					<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Schachter explicitly allows Jews to teach large parts of Torah to non-Jews (eg anything based on logic or justice) and says explicitly you can teach almost all of Nezikin to non-Jews since its mostly סברא. That would be &quot;a lot of room&quot; for engaging with non-Jews on the seven mitzvoth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Rav was really not a moderate when it came to his views on Christianity and Israel. In his recorded shiurim and in his essays published posthumously, he made no secret about what he felt their motives were with regards to the State. Nor did he think that replacement theology had permanently gone away, but he felt that after &#039;48 and &#039;67 it was quietly dropped for the time being out of necessity. And he did say that it was avoda zara gamor. In this specific case, I would say Rav Schachter nailed the Rav&#039;s view.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The interesting (though not surprising) thing here is the way he cites the Rov&#039;s position, leaving no room - in substance or from the tenor of his rhetoric - for the Rov&#039;s affirmation of non-theological dialogue on matters of social concern etc. (Let alone the Rov&#039;s subtle but unmistakable theological engagements with Christianity, and you have written really well on that.) Presumably he would regard that as engaging with Christiians in their version of sheva mitzvos, but he&#039;s not leaving a whole lot of room for that either.  As for his not really addressing the social-political realities underlying Jewish-Christian engagements, let alone their common concern as adherents to traditional religious commitments facing deep challenges in contemporary society and culture - those seem of a piece with Rav Schechter&#039;s generally viewing things through what for lack of a better or more useful word we could call a moderate Haredi prism.]]></description>
