				<p>Continued <a href="../../02/rav-soloveitchik-religious-definitions-of-man-and-his-social-institutions-1959-part-3-of-7/index.html">from part 3- here.</a><br />
This lecture is the emergence, if not the origin, of the <em>Lonely Man of Faith</em> essay.  We have his oblique thoughts on Biblical criticism fleshed out in that he used Cassutto, we have him as a “being for himself” who wants to flee his students, and his definitions of the isolated self of the inner life. He has some pessimistic ideas of human relations and we even have some interesting Holocaust reflections at the end.</p>
<p>This lecture allows me to start a first draft of an academic article on the history of <em>The Lonely Man of Faith</em> lecture (1957-1978). So <a href="http://www.box.com/s/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/4/129360005/1004276061/1#/s/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/4/129360005/1004287271/1">please listen to it </a>and let me know: what are the other differences from the printed 1965 version?  Where do I have errors in my transcription/summary? </p>
<p>Man is defined as a “being for himself” with its Heidegger and Sartre overtones. In this version there is no cognitive or religious man.  There is man as “being for himself” and man as having a religious kerygmatic message for the community.</p>
<p>The biggest difference from the printed version is the reversal of the inner self and the community. In these lectures the isolated lonely self has primacy and the community and its message is a distancing from the self. In the printed version, the community is primary and the individual is the deeper level. This version has the inability of the self to express itself or find articulation, the community reflecting just a pale shadow of the self. In later versions, the self finds fuller articulation in the community or the halakhah. The two sides of man in this version are closer to the distinctions of action and thought (maaseh and kiyyum). In this version dialogue is the social Adam, and incommunicable is the lonely Adam.  Help me flesh out more differences. </p>
<p>Rav Soloveitchik relies on the pessimism of relationships as found in Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekov; later he dropped some of his gloomy views of marriage and family life. </p>
<p>His single line in Lonely Man of Faith about “not being bothered about Biblical criticism” is returned to its fuller oral version. Rav Soloveitchik, following Lessing and Hermann Cohen, chooses philosophy over history as a hermeneutical method. In addition, he has read and was influenced by Umberto Cassuto. Of greater novelty, is that he refers to the stories of Adam and Eve as metaphor and symbols. Adam “fell to sleep” metaphorically means that the creation of Eve was not his choice. The phrase “took a rib” means that fellowship and community is part of man’s nature.</p>
<p>As an organizational matter, this recording is actually #3 and should be listened to before the one mistakenly labeled as #3, which is actually #4. The beginning of #3 that had no context is actually the end of this lecture.<br />
Finally, the site seems to be the Catholic seminary in Brighton MA, the same location as the delivery of Lonely Man of Faith. (You can hear bits of Mass before and after 1:16 as if through a window down a corridor.) So it seems the entire series was delivered there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.box.com/s/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/4/129360005/1004276061/1#/s/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/4/129360005/1004287271/1"><strong>The Self and Crisis – lecture #3 – labeled as #4</strong></a><br />
The self always remains lonely. However, we are more aware of it in our times of crisis, then we mention it. During crisis we have disengagement; we lose our interests, even interests in our family. There is a gradual extinction of interest in others. When doomed we retreat into self and solitary self. </p>
<p>Does the child know how much the parent loves him? No, because it is incommunicable. There is no experience, no existential experience.  <strong>Even man and wife each remain solitary figures.</strong> He cannot exist with her but as a partner- but it is an illusion that they are not separable. The self is not entitled to marriage</p>
<p>My own experience: My father was very devoted He took sick and died quickly. My reaction was mental numbness, hysteria. But then I began to see life without father.  I began to rearrange my life without my father even while he was alive. We see that here is no merger or communication between individuals, human existences do not merge. Am I really bound up with my father? [no!] there is an unbridgeable gulf.  Only surface existence relates to other people. The human core does not. So too husbands and wives are not really bound together. </p>
<p>In the Bible man was created alone (Genesis 1:27) in his own image – male and female. However- in chapter two (Genesis 2:18) it is not good for the man to be alone, he needs a help-mate. In the first version, there was no communication between male and female because he was in the image of God. In chapter 2- where there is no image of God &#8211; he tries to step out of his loneliness. </p>
<p>There are two types of man: one with a kerygmatic message and one who is a lonely man engaged in recoil – these two types are in all of us. One is social and seeks to rejoice and share with others. And the other that intrinsically cannot share, has a limit for words, and feels the suffering of creation. He must look for sharing and communication.</p>
<p>Women are not created from Adam’s heart because then there would be togetherness and mutuality. Rather there is the bond of kerygma by dialogue and message. Adam and Eve loved each other but just a dialogue existence. <strong>Man remains alone, and in crisis he returns to being alone.</strong> </p>

<p>Two years ago my daughter [Atara] had her first child, Moshe. She said “you are my own.” But it is a mistake, he is not your own. To think that all is his as human accomplishment is done by kerygmatic Adam, but he forgets the permanent crisis and distress of Adam.</p>
<p>intercession questions not caught on tape.<br />
After break – better audio</p>
<p><strong>The uniqueness of man not in his intellect, as it was for Maimonides, but in his being for himself.<br />
There are two forms of existence [external] action and hidden within, man is not what he does in action; man is his hidden within.</strong>  [kiyyum and maasah]</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Criticism </strong><br />
The Bible is my book of knowledge. I read Genesis in order to understand social institutions and one must understand this dialectic between action and hidden. “Let us make man- singular, then “let them” –plural.</p>
<p>As you know Bible critics already pointed out these two accounts as differing. The Bible critics always claim two sources. The Bible critics, they make one mistake they don’t try to solve the problem philosophically.<br />
[Umberto] Casutto says they substituted source criticism for philosophic ideas. [AB- Cassuto, Genesis, before second account of creation.)</p>
<p><strong>I tell you this not because I am a rabbi and am dedicated to this text, and not because of fundamentalism. I like to understand the text.</strong></p>
<p>The text is about how from estrangement we came to communication, and how fellowship came into being. The text expresses it as metaphor and symbolically as “taking a rib” and “sleep” to express these two aspects of loneliness and fellowship.<br />
The basic Judaic fellowship is between man and women- introduced this dialectic into basic relation.</p>
<p>Even if you want to accept the Bible critics, but I am not interested in the source, rather the literary structure for the two accounts. The story is not something arbitrary. The story of bringing Eve was intended to show that one account is not sufficient. </p>
<p>The two theses are contradictory and Judaism accepts both-man created alone and together. There are two theories about society- the individual and the communal – Robinson Crusoe and the Hegel corporal state.</p>
<p>God is not a marriage broker – “he was asleep” means that the removal was not a consultation with Adam, rather the original intention of creation; nature itself has the contradiction of alone and together.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage and loneliness </strong><br />
<strong>If we analyze our own experience: we want to escape people and become a hermit – I want to flee my students.</strong> On the other hand we crave fellowship and share experience, which is basic in our experience. We are in crisis because of the tension of loneliness and togetherness, the tension of the solitary Adam and a communicative Adam who wants to share with Eve. Having to give to others is a giving up of solitary self. </p>
<p>What of the sacrament of marriage? Catholics speak of a sacrament. But for Judaism divorce would be the natural state, for Jews marriage is a contractual idea. When I read in Israel about the [debates on] civil and religious marriage, I don’t understand it because all marriage is contractual. Marriage is sacred because all contracts are sacred. Contracts are not sacramental. Therefor divorce is basic institution; no marriage can ever attain perfection. <strong>Adam never totally committed himself to Eve. If Adam moves to the pole of recoil and solitude then the marriage is no longer valid. It is only valid as long as Adam upholds it.</strong> All commitments and contracts are relative, only the relationship to God is absolute-it is here God communicates His loneliness. </p>
<p>The numinous Adam is not involved in any commitment, the kerygmatic Adam seeks commitment. (AB- There is no numinous without the kerygmatic is a repeated phrase from Rudolph Otto to Karl Barth.) Human vocabulary is limited, certain experiences cannot be expressed at all. Language and metaphor are objective and intellectual, they do not convey the inner meanings. </p>
<p>Love is an inner experience, but passed on as expressed in language. I am not talking about introvert and extrovert, Judaism does not believe in [personality] types. It is dialectic of metaphysical experience in every person. The rebellion against fixed religion and state is the numinous and inner life, therefore it is not introversion. And writing, printing, and communication is kerygmatic, so not extroversion. </p>
<p><strong>We treat even our mother and father as objects – we have no insight into them, we want to believe this lack of understanding is rooted in the numinous, but I don’t know. All human commitments are just relative. The numinous aspects of a person can never be passed on. Human institutions are a failure; Adam and Eve are a failure. They are [externally] one flesh but it is not a reality. Friendship, community, marriage are never perfect.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong><br />
Voice is midway between physical and spiritual but not pure only with voice is pure. Voice is material but in between. [AB-source in Tanya] For example, take Beethoven – the music is only kerygma, a small part of the inner music that Beethoven heard–it was only the communicable part.</p>
<p><strong>After Eve</strong><br />
<strong>The image of God is only in Genesis One concerning the numinous. Once he has Eve he does not need God anymore since he has company.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unique Value of Each person (continued on prior tape)</strong><br />
What does this numinous Adam mean for social action? We must inequitably state that Judaism insists that the individual’s worth is not in the quality of kerygma he can deliver or even the beauty of the story he tells, or his accomplishments. Rather in the very fact that he exists. Dignity of man is for numinous not kerygmatic man.<br />
Verse 24- “cattle and beast  after its kind” means  species and genus. What makes man different from the general pattern of creation? The answer that the Sages gave upset classical philosophy. Saving one life is as if saving the whole world. People are not based on their contribution.  </p>
<p>The medieval said man was a microcosm. Each man is unique, because there is no mankind. A table is a universal with specific traits – abstracting from specifics. Man is not part of a mankind, he has no commitment to a universal- he rejects standardization and routine Judaism has an idealization of anonymity. The unknown individual, the vagabond and pauper are all equal to the greatest sage.</p>
<p>If  a criminal said to a group of Jewish women give one of your number to us or else we will defile you. All need to surrender no matter the number.  One must not sacrifice the dignity and individuality of even a single person – even if the woman was criminal. An individual cannot be exchanged for acrowd.</p>
<p>Question from moderator Avrach : What of participation in war? The individual is harmed for the greater good? Rav Soloveitchik- Judaism is opposed to war. We only recognize a war of defense. Self-defense is a basic right. For Judaism, there is no glory in war as in the Odyssey and Iliad. The prophets always condemned war.</p>
<p>Question: During World War II we gave up people to the Nazis in order to save the rest of the community. In Lodz and Vilna- the Jews went along with the Nazi request to deliver people. It is against basic Jewish law and not conformity with basic Jewish ethics. We cannot condemn them. Our religion was realistic but never wise.</p>
<p><strong>Question from a woman- What of saving rabbis and scholars before other people?  This is non-Jewish, but I myself may have been involved in it.</strong></p>

Adam and Eve-Marvin Werlin</p>
<p>AB- For some context, Rav Soloveitchik&#8217;s oscillation between loneliness and fellowship is someplace in between the romanticism of Hesse and the alienation of Plath.<br />
“We must become so alone, so utterly alone, that we withdraw into our innermost self. It is a way of bitter suffering. But then our solitude is overcome, we are no longer alone, for we find that our innermost self is the spirit, that it is God, the indivisible- Hermann Hesse</p>
<p>“God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of &#8220;parties&#8221; with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter &#8211; they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship &#8211; but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering.”<br />
― Sylvia Plath</p>

				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Froman">Rabbi Menachem Froman</a> is the Rabbi of the Settlement of Tekoa, he is an advocate of peace, pluralism, and love. He has a Sufi influenced Orthodoxy. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-west-bank-s-rabbi-menachem-froman-has-the-solution-to-the-conflict.premium-1.452325?localLinksEnabled=false">There is a recent interview</a> that focuses on politics and his terminal illness. (No politics in the comments.) Here is a little gem from from the interview where he discusses theater from the perspective of experimental theater.  </p>
<p><em>Despite your condition, you are still active and are now working to establish a theater.</em></p>
<p>A theotoron: toron referring to the Torah and theo referring to religion. A religious theater. Samuel Beckett said, “What is theater?” A group of people standing on a cliff while below there is a stormy sea in which a drowning man is crying for help − and they cannot help. The drowning people are the actors and the people on the cliff are the audience. In the theater, life is presented as distress. The audience cannot help the prince of Denmark, Hamlet, but is present and is confronted with the problem of human existence. [The late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Grotowski">Polish theater director Jerzy] Grotowski</a> proposes a different definition. He likens theater to a hill at night where someone has poured gasoline on himself and set himself alight, while around the hill people are standing and watching, their faces lit by him.</p>
<p>What I gather from this is that the actor gives his life, and his selfless devotion illuminates the faces of the viewers. A third definition is that in the theater the actors and the audience overcome gravity for an hour and a half. The audience is elevated. As [Rabbi] Moishe Levinger says, What is dancing? A person jumps up and overcomes the force of gravity. In Yiddish the “force of gravity” is the “force of gravitas” − in Hebrew “koved,” in Yiddish “koived.”</p>
<p><em>Is there no element of idol worship in theater?</em></p>
<p>A person in the theater jumps up, overcomes his ego, his self − the self-definition that does not allow you to be free. To play-act is to be free. Also, in the biblical sense, to love. That is certainly freedom. <strong>So this theater is a religious theater, not in the sense that it observes the halakha [Jewish religious law] or draws on the Jewish sources, but that it achieves the purpose of religion: to liberate man and cause him to love.</strong> This is the repentance of the religious public, from subjugation to the halakha and its rigidity to freedom and love.</p>
<p>When I sat with my son Shibi and we thought about what we were getting into, owing to my illness, Shibi said that the only thing we need to work on is the theater. That is the dream. In the past few years <strong>I have been teaching the Zohar, because it posits itself as an answer to the revealed Torah. It seeks to liberate us from religious dogmatism and from the halakha.</strong> “To be a free people in our land” − I am not enthralled by the national anthem, but when I hear that line I am moved. The idea that for certain moments you can liberate yourself from gravity and gravitas is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>Peace between a man and his fellow man, between a nation and its neighbor is all a kind of mental adjustment, a decision of the soul, which wants to move to the side of peace. It is necessary to purify the Jewish religion.</p>
<p><em>What do you mean?</em></p>
<p>On festive occasions I dress like my grandfather, who was a Gerrer Hasid. I put on a white kapote [robe-coat] and white spodik [tall fur hat]. I think Judaism has to be transformed from black to white. I spent many hours in meetings and in studying Islam, and this activity was undertaken to transform the religion into white. Rabbi Kook, whose picture is here opposite me, says that the whole of the Jewish religion is a process of purification from idol worship.</p>
<p><em>From what would you like to purify the Jewish religion?</em></p>
<p>From idol worship. From egoism. I feel that there is something very, very deep in the love between man and land. That has always been my image. Man is made from dust and to dust he will return. The connection between man and his land is the connection to his life source. That connection can derive from love or it can derive from possessiveness: meaning that you want to be the owner of the land, to control it. Instead of being swallowed up in your wife, you want to be the owner of your wife. When I met with [Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, he gave me volumes of the poetry of Jalaluddin Rumi. Rumi writes that one can be swallowed in the earth like sugar that dissolves in water. <strong>If you have an orientation toward being swallowed, of abnegation in the face of the objective truth, that is peace.</strong><br />

				<p>We offer our deepest condolences for the members of the Sikh gurdwara of Oak Creek, Wisconsin in the wake of the senseless shooting on Sunday. For those looking for a way to relate to Sikhism in Jewish terms, I offer a lecture by Rabbi Yakov Nagan of Othniel who is a R&#8221;M at Yeshivat Othniel. Rabbi Nagan has been to India and came away with deep respect for the Sikh faith. For, Nagan, Sikhism is not just monotheistic, but the closest to the vision that Judaism has for a world religion for humanity as spelled out by the Talmud. Below is a video of the lecture; there is more in the video than in the accompanying blurb under it.</p>

‘ The Golden Temple and the Beit HaMikdash’ A monotheistic Temple sounds almost an oxymoron as the Temples existing today are by and large adorned with statues and idols. A notable exception is the Golden Temple in Amritsar of the Sikh religion, a temple which has neither pictures nor statues. Of world religions, Sikhism is closest to the vision that Judaism has for a world religion for humanity as spelled out by the Talmud. Comparing and contrasting the Golden Temple to the Beit HaMikdash, gives insight both in to the meaning of a concrete physical temple for an infinite Gd as well as highlighting the uniqueness of the Beit HaMikdash. The heart of the Golden Temple is a book, the original copy of the central book of the Sikh religion, as is in the Beit HaMikdash whose heart is the Torah and Tablets give to Moshe by Gd and contained in the Ark in the inner sanctuary. On the other hand the Beit HaMikdash reflects Judaism’s belief of sanctity of space which is absent from the Sikh religion. Judaism belief that together with the belief that Gd is omnipresent and infinite there are places that this presence is more manifested and this is what leads to the unique status and significance of the land of Israel, Jerusalem and the Beit HaMikdash.</p>

				<p>Two of <em>The Forward</em> editors sent me some questions about the new book on the converts who played a big role in changing the Church&#8217;s attitudes. This was basically Q and A exchange: Will this lead to conspiracy theories? Have people heard of this before? Will it now be overturned?It was originally just going to be a blog post on one of the Forward&#8217;s blogs. By the end of the process, it became an op-ed. </p>
<p>Two things that did not come out in the piece that are relevant. The first is how much Oesterreicher gave the Jews the willys as a convert. Among Jews, he came off as an ethnic Jew who rejected his people. They saw little good from a conversion. the JTA archive articles are quite negative. I have been told that Rav Soloveitchik was still worried that Oesterreicher wanted to convert his co-religionists. He was not worried about many others. And last year, Rabbanite Prof Judith Bleich told me some less than flattering stories about how they remembered Oesterreicher. </p>
<p>The second point is that the role of converts was not just true about the Catholic-Jewish case but also of the Catholic-Muslim and Catholic-Hindu encounters. To have language to create a commonality took border-crossers and converts, for example Henri Le Saux, a Benedictine priest who lives in India became known as Swami Abhishiktananda.</p>

No Going Back on Vatican II, Despite Converted Clerics Role</a></p>
<p>By Alan Brill<br />
Published <em>The Forward </em>August 06, 2012.</p>
<p>I teach my classes at Seton Hall University in a seminar room known as<br />
the Oesterreicher Suite, in which a photograph of Monsignor John M.<br />
Oesterreicher looks down on the class as it is being held. The room<br />
itself is comprised of glass cases with speeches and documents that<br />
track and illustrate the Monsignor’s path from Catholic convert of<br />
Jewish origin, encouraging others to follow his path of conversion to<br />
a commitment to change the Church’s attitude toward the Jews.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Monsignor Oesterreicher lived in Germany and belonged to<br />
the Freiberg Circle, which opposed anti-Semitism and sought a<br />
non-racist approach toward Judaism. After World War II, he founded an<br />
institute for the then-oxymoronic concept Judeo-Christian studies and<br />
was an editor for The Bridge, a 1950s journal which allowed Catholic<br />
authors to develop positive approaches toward Judaism. These efforts<br />
bore fruit as the 1961 publication, “Decree on the Jews” to which<br />
Oesterreicher was the major contributor. It took four years of<br />
ecumenical work to produce a fourth draft of the original document,<br />
which became known as Nostra Aetate.</p>
<p>John Connelly, a renowned University of California historian, recently<br />
wrote an excellent work, From Enemy to Brother: The Revolution in<br />
Catholic Teaching on the Jews, showing the important role that Jewish<br />
and Protestant converts to Catholicism played in the creation of Nosta<br />
Aetate.</p>
<p>Is this a revelation? The answer is no, as all the pieces were known.<br />
Oesterreicher ’s Jewish roots and his role are well known to those<br />
involved in interfaith encounter. Connelly put the material together<br />
in a new way with less emphasis on other figures and greater emphasis<br />
on the converts.</p>
<p>Connelly’s new book focuses on Oesterreicher’s role, as well as Karl<br />
Theme and Dietrich von Hildebrand, who both converted from<br />
Protestantism. It should be noted that the Frieberg circle also<br />
included non-converts who directly opposed the Nazi regime such as the<br />
German Economic Minister Franz Bohm and the historian, Gerhard Ritter.</p>
<p>In this quest, Karl Theme pushed forward and was in dialogue with the<br />
German Jewish thinkers Buber, Adorno, and Schoeps. Oesterreicher<br />
dragged his feet in this endeavor and in discussion with Theme still<br />
envisioned a conversion of the Jews.</p>
<p>Oesterreicher is remembered by many Jews with ambivalence as a 1960s<br />
defender of the Catholic Church. Now, in this new reading, Connelly<br />
agrees with the charitable approaches toward Oesterreicher as the<br />
1960s a mouthpiece for the progressive words and ideas of Karl Theme,<br />
which he used in the drafts leading to Nosta Aetate. Connelly also<br />
shows the importance of the Jewish thinkers such as A. J. Heschel and<br />
Ernst Ehrlich for their influence on Cardinal Bea.</p>
<p>Will this lead to new conspiracy theories focusing on the prominent<br />
role attributed to Jewish-born theologians? Until this book was<br />
published, most of the many online conspiracy theories blamed the<br />
French Jewish historian, Jules Isaac, who in 1947, laid the need for a<br />
change before the Church. The conspiracy theorists also blame the<br />
B’nai B’rith as Freemasons and the American Jewish Committee as<br />
maliciously manipulating the situation.</p>
<p>The conspiracy theorists will never go away, it is just that now, they<br />
may just transfer their theories to the converts to Catholicism. One<br />
might also ask: will it lead to new anti-Semitism? No, to give a<br />
similar answer as before: none of this is new material. More<br />
importantly, most Catholics have already accepted the full gamut of<br />
changes of Vatican II, most are young enough to have never known<br />
another Church.</p>
<p>The actual start of this process was the 1947 meeting in Seelingberg,<br />
Germany by both Protestants and Catholics who thought that after the<br />
Holocaust, Christianity must relinquish its teaching of contempt<br />
toward Jews. It took a half century of hard work for most Christian<br />
denominations to change their attitude toward the Jews.</p>
<p>The reception of Connolly’s book shows that many Jews are still not<br />
aware of the message of Nostae Aetate. The document was part of a much<br />
larger series of documents of Vatican II, none of which dealt with<br />
Jews, that brought the Church into the 20th century. Nosta Aetate<br />
states that there is a bond that ties the people of the “New Covenant”<br />
(Christians) to “Abraham’s Stock” (Jews). It acknowledges that Israel<br />
received the revelation first, that Jews remain dear to God, and that<br />
Christianity grew out of Judaism. It rejects the deicide charges and<br />
decries all displays of anti-Semitism made at any time by anyone.</p>
<p>One must remember that prior to this document, Jews were seen by some<br />
documents as blinded, the Devil, and false; and that once the Jews<br />
have served their purpose then God has forgotten them. Jesus had<br />
transcended and had nothing in common with his birth religion,<br />
according to this now-outdated view.</p>
<p>It took more than three decades for Pope John Paul II to acknowledge<br />
Judaism as a living religion with an eternal covenant, to recognize<br />
the Holocaust, and to actively acknowledge the state of Israel. Pope<br />
Benedict XVI has moved the religions closer in Catholic thought by<br />
teaching that Jews and Catholics share one common Abrahamic covenant<br />
based on Genesis 15. Additionally, Pope Benedict strongly rejects the<br />
idea of two separate but equal covenants. Situating Jesus in his<br />
Jewish context is now taken as obvious.</p>
<p>Nostae Aetate was a revolution. But it did not in itself offer<br />
pluralism, recognize Judaism as a separate religion or, even as John<br />
Paul II did, grant continuous validity to Judaism. The document has<br />
both progressive and conservative interpretations.</p>
<p>Current Catholic questions and dividing lines of progressive and<br />
conservative interpretations have to do with how the Jewish covenant<br />
functions, how are Jews saved, and how the Trinity works through the<br />
Jewish people. These debates are not about Jewish self-understanding ,<br />
rather Catholic doctrine.. For those interested in the official<br />
Vatican thinking about Judaism, I would recommend the document<br />
“Building on ‘Nostra Aetate’—50 Years of Christian-Jewish Dialogue,”<br />
by Cardinal Kurt Koch and issued May16, 2012; it contains Pope<br />
Benedict’s definitive legacy on Judaism.<br />
(<a href="http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/roman-catholic/kurt-cardinal-koch/1116-koch2012may16" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/roman-catholic/kurt-cardinal-koch/1116-koch2012may16</a>)</p>
<p>As for the subject of Connelly’s new book, the author considers the<br />
fragile, contingent, and almost accidental nature of this change. As<br />
someone who works in a Catholic university with a seminary on campus,<br />
this change is permanent. It is necessary, and part of the<br />
self-definition of the Catholic mission.</p>
<p>Seton Hall University will be commemorating in 2013-2014 the 50th<br />
anniversary of John M. Oesterreicher’s Judeo-Christian Institute.<br />
There will be speakers, a conference, and translations of<br />
Oesterreicher’s early work.</p>

				<p>Here are selection from a 1940’s Religious Zionist bestseller, Hans (Joseph) Heinemann’s tract <em>Torah and Social Order.</em> In the work, he claims that the social order envisioned in the Talmud and halakhah are against the spirit of capitalism, and currently socialism in Israel is the closest we can come.</p>
<p>I post this because readers were amused by my <a href="../../../05/01/mizrachi-workers-party-for-may-day/index.html">May Day post</a> and the post of Isidore Epstein&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="../../../05/02/social-legislation-in-the-talmud-isidore-epstein/index.html">socialism of the Soncino Talmud</a>. Many readers did not about the socialist Zionism that was produced by German Orthodoxy.  The last of these German born Orthodox liberals was the recently deceased <a href="../../../06/17/memorial-for-yoske-achituv-by-yehudah-mirsky/index.html">Yoshke Achituv.</a>I had expected to post this in May with the other Orthodox socialism tracts, but this pamphlet turned out to be exceedingly rare even for interlibrary loan.</p>
<p>Joseph Heinemann, (1915-1978, &nbsp;originally Hans) was the preeminent liturgy and Aggadah scholar of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. He was born in Germany and went to Mir for yeshiva. He served as rabbi on the kinder transport and for the kibbutz training. He spent the end of the war in Manchester. Heinemann became a leading ideologue of the German Religious Zionist Orthodoxy. He eventually got to Israel in 1949. His most famous work was <a href="http://www.hebrewbooks.org/33563"><em>Tefilah in the Era of the Tannaim and Ammoraim </em>[Hebrew]</a>, translated decades later as <em>Prayer in the Talmud</em>, <em>Forms and Patterns.</em></p>
<p>He is not to confused with his contemporary namesake in the same academic field, the Hebrew editor of Hirsch, and aggadah scholar Isaac Heinemann.</p>
<p>This work <em>Torah and Social Order</em> (Brit Chalutzim Datiim-Bachad 1944) was based on his MA. This little tract went through four editions and was translated into French, Hungarian, and Romanian. Picture immigrants to the kibbutz arriving with copies of this work in their suitcase.</p>
<p>Heinemann concludes from his study of the Rabbis that the system of capitalism can never lead to righteousness as required by the Torah. Socialism is the closest we can come today. He does not want to combine Marxism with Torah just to let the Torah’s ideal of communalism to come out. And as he says, he does not preach class-struggle, rather accepts it as Torah reality. Heineman also think halakhah will change to overcome the individualism of the exile and return to the true intention of the Torah contained in Rabbinic statements. He rejects legal loophole and wants to return to the true spirit of the law.&nbsp; Heinemann wrote many articles and educational works for Religious Zionist community on topics ranging from Biblical criticism and how to teach Mishnah to economics, many of them are online</p>
<p>There are several other works in this Brit Chalutzim Datiim-Bachad series. Should I do Rav Amiel’s socialist work next the Izbitz influences first mayor of Jerusalem, Sh. Z. Shragai&nbsp; ?</p>

<p>This second edition of “<em>Torah and Social Order</em>” appears after a comparatively short time, owing to the great interest which this pamphlet has been received in wide circles. It has met with appreciation and serious attention among Jewish youth, many of whom were surprised to learn that Judaism does not altogether belong to the past, but still holds a meaning for the present and a message for the future.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I have not attempted to draw a comparison between socialism as a philosophy, and Judaism. Still less do I advocate an amalgamation of Marxian materialism with the teachings of the Torah. I am concerned with <em>socialism as a system of social and economic organization</em>, based on common, instead of private ownership of the means of production, and this I sincerely believe to be the only sensible and workable social system for our age, as well as the only one under which the social ideals of the Torah can be translated into reality to-day… <strong>I do not “preach” class-struggle, but I accept it as an important factor of social reality</strong>.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>But now the time is over when the doctrine of<em> laissez-faire</em> letting economics look after itself—can be maintained. To-day decisions of far-reaching consequence have to be taken regarding the order of society: and in these decisions the moral aspect ought to play a decisive role. If so, it is up to religion to concern itself with this part of life again…The church has started to show a way. Judaism has not yet done so.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p><strong>Our society is based on egoism, acquisitiveness, competition and self-assertiveness, and continuously strengthens and develops those qualities in its members.</strong> It is therefore a mere illusion to believe that religion can leave social questions to the state and concentrate on its particular task of educating the individual to righteousness.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>What is to be the Jewish attitude to modern social problems? How can we apply the social legislation and social principles of the Torah to present-day conditions? It is clear that we cannot simply take over the social institution of the Torah as they are and attempt to introduce them to-day. Even if it were possible, the effect would not be the same under entirely different conditions. The cornerstone of the Torah-society is the distribution of the land among all citizens; in an agrarian society this ensures economic independence for everybody. Even if the same measure could be introduced to-day, it would be meaningless in our society, where the essential question is that of ownership of industrial means or production, and would leave the problem of economic dependence and exploitation unsolved.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p><strong>The rights of property are very limited, and he who possesses wealth must put it at the disposal of others without expecting any profit by doing so.</strong><br />
It is a society which is based on two main ideas:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>That all wealth ultimately belongs to G-d who only lent it to man: “Ki li haaretz.” (“For mine is the Land”).</li>
<li>That men are brothers, with equal rights and standing, and with an equal claim to enjoy the fruits of the soil; obliged to co-operate and help, not to compete and fight each other; “ve-ahavta lere’acha kamocha.” (“Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself”).<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn6">[6]</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>One thing has emerged clearly from what has been said so far: that the capitalist system is fundamentally opposed to the ideals of the Torah…</strong>This does not mean the Torah teaches Socialism… Those ideas are very much akin to those of the Torah: they are not identical with them, but they are the nearest approach to them which is feasible in our times. <strong>To-day, therefore, the Torah leads us to join in the struggle for socialism.</strong><a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>What will be necessary, then, is new legislation, which will solve in the spirit of Torah those social problems, that would not be covered by the existing traditional laws. We must see to it, that social and economic relations as a whole should be governed by the principles of co-operation and mutual help rather than competition and egotism; that economic inequality, dividing the nation into an exploited and an exploiting class, will be avoided and that the main means of production will not be controlled by individuals or small groups to their own benefit.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>It will be a great task for our Rabbis in conjunction with economists to decide in what way exactly those and similar questions will be dealt with. But so much can already be said now, that the resulting social order will, broadly speaking be socialist in character—for that is only alternative to capitalism to-day.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>It may be asked how far such “modern” measures, such new forms of social organization could be said to be an application of the Torah; and how far we have the right to create the necessary new legislation which though in keeping with the Torah spirit will, after all, result in a society very much different from that of the Torah. This question is, however, unjustified. Through centuries of Galut-history, during which there was hardly any opportunity for Jewish social legislation, we may have gained the impression that new or additional legislation by Jewish authorities is impossible; but, in fact, the very opposite is true. <strong>The Torah itself makes it the duty, not merely the right, of the religious leaders and the state to create new legislation in accordance with the needs of the times</strong> &#8230;&nbsp;<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The Mishnah is full of rabbinic legislation of religious, social and economic character that is motivated by “Tikkun haOlam” which might be translated freely as “the promotion of welfare of the world.”… Jewish authorities have always realized and responded to the need of change in social matters. Their powers in this field of legislation are specially wide; they are based on the principle of “Hefker Bet Din Hefker,” by which any Jewish Court, even one the members of which have no Semichah (full authorization), may transfer property from its legal owner to another person or even alter laws concerning property. In the field of “Dine Menonot”—economics—then, there is full scope for change, wherever necessary… <strong>Our aim, then will not be somehow to satisfy the claims of Halachah; but to build up an order permeated by the true spirit of Torah, and, where necessary and possible even to go further than the “law” demands</strong>.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p><strong>There is a “Kavvanat Hatorah” (“Intention of the Torah”) in addition to its legislation…</strong> [W]e shall endeavor to create a society which corresponds to its true and real intentions as closely as possible. We shall not base our social and economic life on “Hetterim,” loopholes of the law, as the medieval Jew had to do and as the Galut (Dispersion).<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>This individualistic way of life is so characteristic of modern European civilization is far from the way of life the Torah visualizes where everybody forms an integral part of an organic community.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Read the Rest Here- <a href="https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/heinemann-torah-and-social-order1.pdf">Heinemann- Torah and Social Order</a></p>
<p>This next section was included in the volume. I do not know the author.</p>
<p><strong>Brit Chalutzim Datiim Bahad Platform adopted at the fourth meeting 1943</strong></p>
<p>The long unhappy history of the Jewish people since the dispersion has been punctuated by a series of crises and at each emergency some temporary movement has taken place which has enabled our exiled people to carry on until the next crisis arose.<br />
But this is the darkest hour of all. Never before have ALL doors been closed to fugitive Jews; never before has such wholesale slaughter been carried out; never before has the outlook been so bleak.<br />
Faced with this stark tragedy two things stand out clear to us. One, that only by a return to Zion can we really avert such disasters from recurring, and secondly that the salvation of the Jew depends on himself—that he must to-day take stock of himself, throw off the yoke of Galuth and undertake a change in his way of life—in thought, in word, in deed.<br />
We call upon you to do this by accepting with us TORAH VA’AVODAH as the only ideal on which the Jewish people can re-establish themselves; RELIGIOUS CHALUTZUIT as the only means by which they can do so. You must in this time of crumbling spiritual values declare your faith in God, your loyalty to the eternal principles of our ancient faith…</p>
<p>You must see with us that realization of these ideals can only come about by a collective communal life. You must recognize Zionism without the will and readiness to Hagshamah and Chalutziut has no reality, for neither wealth nor political power can be effective without the chalutzic spirit to guide our people and our youth.<a title="" href="../../../../Users/brillala/Downloads/heinemann%20Quotes%20part%202-blog%20version.doc.html#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>

				<p>This lecture is a continuation from <a href="../../../06/07/rav-soloveitchik-religious-definitions-of-man-and-his-social-institutions-part-1of-7-1958/index.html">Part One </a>and <a href="../../../06/17/part-2-of-7-rav-soloveitchik-religious-definitions-of-man-and-his-social-institutions-1958/index.html">Part Two.</a> This one is a power house of Rav Soloveitchik’s thoughts on politics and ethics. He rejects the death penalty for the Rosenbergs, he thinks that the state if Israel needs to be judged on its ethics, and that election slander is forbidden. He has a great line “If the state does not live up to our ethical values, then the entire past 2000 years, the entirety of Jewish history will be reinterpreted in a different light. It will prove to the world that Jews are not better and only did not act wickedly because they did not have a chance.” Jews need to value ethics and human dignity for all of humanity and Jews are not better than others. He also admits his personal tension between his ideal of dignity and his impatience with the less educated.</p>
<p>The lecture is labeled 1958, but it is actually 1959 since the lecture mentions Rav Soloveitchik just returned from Washington giving testimony, which occurred on Nov. 20, 1959. The event was the&nbsp; Secretary of Agriculture created standards for the humane treatment of slaughtering animals in 1957, and there was a debate about kosher slaughtering in 1959. So this lecture is after Thanksfgiving, on Dec 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1959. It seems to be in a room of social workers in a Christian setting. The voice in the tape who is running the show seems to be Rabbi Avrach, the director of Community Serives at YU. These weeks Ben Hur was released &nbsp;and Khrusnev started his nuclear buildup that week. Ben Gurion had dissolved the 3<sup>rd</sup> Knesset at the start of November when information was leaked into the public and elections had just ended for the fourth Knesset elections. (Feel free to send me typos in &nbsp;the comments.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http:///www.box.com/s/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/4/129360005/1004276061/1">Lecture 3</a></strong></p>
<p>The lecture is missing the beginning. The organizing rubric is the dignity of man in his unique individuality.</p>
<p>The opening was on the question of having to choose a person when a killer says to pick one of your group.&nbsp; Also he deals with the case of two people who walk in desert with only one pitcher of water. If in possession of one then one drinks the water. If in joint possession then both die [Missing Discussion.]</p>
<p><strong>High Priest and Met Mizvah</strong></p>
<p>The second topic was the high priest and the met mitzvah (when a person dies and there is no one to deal with their burial).The priest ordinarily cannot have contact with dead bodies. &nbsp;Judaism has an aversion to death – we are helpless before it. But in the case of a met mitzvah even a high priest defiles himself. (Berakhot 20a) The high priest was the highlight of the Temple service and of Second temple Judaism. They &nbsp;prayed for him and it was the high point of the year. &nbsp;There are Roman sources showing the glory of the high priest on the day of atonement. The Rav quotes Ben Sira chapter 50 (A source of Mareh Kohen)</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;How was he honored in the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary!&nbsp;<strong>6</strong>&nbsp;He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full;&nbsp;<strong>7</strong>&nbsp;as the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High, and as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds;&nbsp;<strong>8</strong>and as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, as lilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer;</p>
<p>The high priest gives up his catharsis attained in the Temple service for the dignity and inner worth of the person. Each person is singular – even a vagabond, prostitute, or pauper has a greatness of the individual. The &nbsp;supreme meaning of the individual is his uniqueness and loneliness. The Temple service with its focus on mercy and forgiveness would be stripped of its meaning and made into a mockery &nbsp;if the high priest did not appreciate the dignity of the individual – even the vagabond and the prostitute.</p>
<p>[AB- Rav Soloveitchik has several versions of dignity in his thought. In LMF, dignity is linked to responsibility and majesty reflecting Kantian and Brunner concerns. In <em>Emergence of Ethical Man</em> and elsewhere, man needs to rise above the animal state to attain dignity; some people have relinquished their dignity through their bestial actions. This version that emphasizes the uniqueness of each person as presented here comes back in the mid-1970’s versions summarized in Besdin, <em>Reflections of the Rav. </em>It is also the meaning of the blessing Hakham Razim in the 1957 philosophy of prayer lectures.]</p>
<p>A women asks about individuality vs community. The Rav answers that -Judaism does not accept placing the individual above the community but because of dignity we place the dignity of others, even individuals, above the self.</p>
<p>Man has value for himself, even without any contribution to society. There is an inner worth to even the anonymous person.</p>
<p>Why listen to me? Everything I say is common place. There is nothing new. I have no false modesty. These ideas are basic.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cult or Ethos?</span></strong></p>
<p>Rabbi Avrach asks a leading question: Does that apply to every man regardless of color, creed, and religion? The Rav answers that Yes, it does. Judaism is both parochial and universal . We are universal for dignity, you are right. But we are particular for sanctity. Whenever we distinguish between Jew and gentile we are labeled as parochial. The distinction is between dignity and sanctity. Many laws are under sanctity not dignity. Anything that only applies to the kerygmatic community is sanctity.&nbsp; The dignity is the inner worth of every person.</p>
<p>The sanctity in Judaism is of the body. In contrast in Christianity it means the soul. (AB- this was soon to change in Vatican II). Judaism looks upon man as a body like the scientific community. Dignity is reflected in the body. We are influenced by Christian concepts- like spiritual vs physical. A Christian theologian asked him: What is Judaism’s singular contribution? It is not monotheism since we find it also in Egyptian and Greek thought.&nbsp; The unique contribution of Judaism is the unified cult and ethos. Unlike Socrates who discharged his service to the gods but they are not interested in our relationship to fellow man. Pagan religions have no ethics, the ethics is from philosophy. The gods were unethical.</p>
<p>Judaism is about how you treat your fellow man, the laborer, the poor, your parents, how a king treats its citizens &nbsp;You serve God by following moral law. Even the Sabbath is about its social meaning – it is so workers, slaves, animals should rest. (AB- Hermann Cohen, <em>Essay on the Sabbath</em> 1869 &amp; <em>Religion of Reason</em>)</p>
<p>The prophets are not against cult, and there is something in man that requires cult. They were against cult without ethics.</p>
<p>When Reform says the Temple is the center of Judaism, when the Conservative say the synagogue is the center, when the Orthodox says the beit kenesset is the center. They are wrong. It is how we act at work, with the family, at home, at the night club [!], and on the street. The beit kenesset needs to reflect ethos. If there is a gap or a gulf between work and temple- that is what the prophets reject.</p>
<p>The trouble with Catholicism is psychology – a man like Francisco Franco is a schizophrenic. <a href="http://blogs.vassar.edu/envisioningspainsborder/?p=382">Franco can go to cathedral and knell.</a> He can say “let your will be done”&nbsp; [The Rav translates it into Latin- not a direct quote from the mass but a free translation of Luke 22:42 nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.] It is not hypocrisy. Franco delivers himself into God’s hands. In the cathedral, he is intoxicated by fragrance of the incense, and as long as the savior looks at him from the crucifix&nbsp; he is in God’s hands. But he can afterwards sign a death sentence on a revolutionary on the steps of the church. There is no connection between the two parts of his life.</p>

<p><em><strong>Agra deKallah Duhka</strong></em></p>
<p>“The benefit of the gathering is the crushing.” (Berakhot 6b) – It was like the Catholic ecumenical assemblies.&nbsp; This teaches that the reward is not for intellectual attainment but discomfort. Someone who does not understand what is discussed-he is bored and lonely. He was an outsider yet he diligently attended all sessions.&nbsp; Why he did it psychologically is irrelevant, but he gets reward for his pain. Reward is based on the hardness of the bench.</p>
<p>“Axiological democracy”- is what Judaism believes in.&nbsp; Modern man understands “political democracy” and socialist countries claim “economic democracy.”&nbsp; However, axiological democracy”- the worth of the individual person is what Judaism strives for.</p>
<p>I don’t understand&nbsp; how we can attain this level. It seems fantasy and imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Ethics and the State of Israel</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have the state of Israel- we are judged by our ethics.</p>
<p>The pages of history are bloody with the acts of European society – especially in feudal times. Judaism is not better because we are better than them but because we never had to face the challenge. A private person cannot do the injustices that can be done by a state. What if our history had been different, with a Jewish state in the Middle ages? Would we have been just like the feudal law? I have no answer? To say how we would have acted is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now that we have a Jewish state, will we act ethically? The State in itself is a contradiction to ethics.<strong> Will we refrain from injustices, or immoral practices?</strong></p>
<p>The few experiences, so far, are not re-assuring. I don’t know. We are the master now. Will we act like masters? Will we acknowledge that <strong>Judaism does not recognize a morality of master and slave, powerful and powerless, victor and vanquished. This is my problem with the State of Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the state does not live up to our ethical values then the entire past 2000 years, the entirety of Jewish history will be reinterpreted in a different light. It will prove to the world that Jews are not better and only did not act wickedly because they did not have a chance.</strong></p>
<p>Wicked activity is connected with state power. Even the most powerful Jew did not avoid the experience of persecution as a stateless person.</p>
<p>Therefore Jews had compassion for the weak. But what will happen if Jews had a state? <strong>Things like McCarthy laws or the restrictions on groups immigrating to the country should not be passed in Israel</strong></p>
<p>I won’t take an oath now to it. But, I hear voices in the Knesset that I don’t like. We should be proud of Israel whether we are a Zionist or not. Outside community considers it Jewish. Jewish, however, is not a question of defeating Arabs on the field of battle- it is <strong>whether we will defeat our evil within- this is our most important problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Return to Topic of human Dignity</strong></p>
<p>In the Modern world we are not truly all equal</p>
<p>Rabbi Avrach- but as social workers we treat all equally.</p>
<p>Rav- Those are little cases and it’s a profession. Let me ask about your inner feelings. Do you have the same feelings when you speak to a lowly client as when you speak to Nelson Rockefeller?</p>
<p>Avrach &#8211; We see in every individual something.</p>
<p>Rav- Yes, I am supposed to see a reflection in every person of our father Abraham. It is an ideal but far from practice. I myself &nbsp;have a great gulf. I have reverence for the person of science or economics&nbsp; But no reverence toward my taxi driver. In this, I am not worse or better than others.</p>
<p>Dignity comes from the Kerygmatic personality and utilitarian &nbsp;purpose [AB- See above on types of dignity]</p>
<p>[We have two&nbsp; minutes of dead time at 46 minutes until 48:14.]</p>
<p>In the existential experience – who is greater Kant or a poor tailor – it is hard to say [AB- Ricoeur and other have moved pass this impasse.] Whose blood is greater among people? Who is greater only God can judge.</p>
<p>Avrach &#8211; What is Existential experience? &nbsp;It is the ego I experience not Existentialist &nbsp;as a philosophic doctrine.</p>
<p>I.L. Peretz &nbsp;has a short story “meshuga batlan”&nbsp; “who am I?” They recognize me but who am I? Can I be explained in externals?&nbsp; Rav – this problem of the batlan disturbs me as well.</p>
<p>Judaism formulates its social ethic as a truism of &nbsp;human dignity and awareness of self-worthiness.</p>
<p>[dead spot at 53 minutes – less than minutes]</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Libel, shame, dayyanim, and the Rosenberg case</span></strong></p>
<p>There are basic rights of individual including the right to experience basic dignity. Anyone who inflicts injury on someone’s self- respect will be severely punished by God. It is not just slander or libel. But even insulting someone’s pride or causing embarrassment to someone, especially in public is as murder.</p>
<p>I listen to pre-election speeches: What would rabbinic scholars have thought- of the shaming and insulting? <strong>A political campaign is impossible in Jewish ethics. In Israel where they have elections, they are not Jews anymore. </strong>It is a crime to shaming others in public, and to speak not truthfully.</p>
<p>Yes, a rodef is to be exposed. But it is to be done without drama or appeal to lower instincts of the crowd. A moser an informer is one who gives information to enemy as espionage. Even if in a Jewish state and one knows about &nbsp;a crime , he has no right to inform state. You are not to be a judge over other people. Even in criminal matters, you are only obligated to testify if summoned. This is all only if it does not endangers others.</p>
<p>Even courts in the past were a mystery to Jews. The dayyan is in a precarious situation in Jewish ethics. The dayyan should see himself as subject to wrath from below and Divine anger from above.&nbsp; Judges are not entitled to pass judgment on others. There is something inhuman in it. Halakhah had to come to terms reluctantly with courts.</p>
<p>Avrach- Look at the Rosenberg trial with Judge Kaufman. A few of the rabbis tried to get to him.</p>
<p>Rav Soloveitchik- I don’t believe he was so stupid as to give a death penalty in peace time. The information came via the scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Fuchs">[Klaus] Fuchs.</a> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg">Rosenbergs were small simple people</a>. In my opinion it was murder. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Kaufman">Judge Kaufman</a> did not do a service to the United States or its security. It was the McCarthy atmosphere.&nbsp; What if Kaufman was not a Jew – would he have given a death sentence? I think not?</p>
<p>Avrach &#8211; Aren’t you judging the judge? Rav- You are right, mea culpa. What can I do?</p>
<p>Avrach- Is this from a Jewish point of view or your own?</p>
<p>Rav Soloveitchik- It is the Jewish point of view. The death penalty as non-halakhic punishment is not a possibility [to be just].</p>
<p>Avrach- Judge Kaufman said he looked to his God what to do. Rackman went to him.</p>
<p>Rav Soloveitchik-<strong> It is a McCarthy God not a Jewish God</strong>. &nbsp;To introduce the God of Judaism into the death penalty as a punishment for small people is unwarranted. <strong>Respecting the inner dignity of each person is Jewish.</strong> &nbsp;Don’t oppress anyone.</p>
<p>Avrach –What of the informing in the Maimonidean controversy and between Mitnagdim and Hasidim? Rav Soloveitchik- it is wrong even if great people did it. It is an ideal and not a guiding light</p>
<p>Avrach – So you mean like in Christianity which has many unrealized ideals. Rav- I am not&nbsp; romanticizing but it was the reality.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Widows and Orphans</span></strong></p>
<p>Lev. 19:14-<em> don’t curse the deaf and no stumbling block before blind.&nbsp;</em>They are handicapped and wont accomplish much in life but they still have dignity.&nbsp; Ex 23:20 – don’t vex a stranger or widow or fatherless child- [AB-He is quoting from a Christian Bible in the room. Where is this meeting being held?]</p>
<p>Maimonides Deot 6 – Deot means virtues. One should treat widows and orphans only tenderly and with courtesy, don’t pain them or even shames them.</p>
<p>The story of the 10 martyrs who lived in Palestine [asarah harugei malkhut] It is a strange story but is typical –– it looks historical. Rabbi Akiva &nbsp;– I am not frightened but we don’t deserve to be killed like ordinary criminals.&nbsp;[missing at 1:20]</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel was told: Once you took a nap and a poor women inquired if the bread is clean or unclean and your servant told her to wait a while. And the lonely widow sighed and felt hurt that since she is not prominent therefore she had to wait.&nbsp; You know the penalty is to be slayed by sword.</p>
<p>The Talmud is a bit Freudian in its approach to dreams- &nbsp;dreams reflect the personality; so too ideals reflect the religious consciousness. Here the ideal is that no one should be made to wait “ Rabban Gamliel realizes that “I am just a sinner as all others”</p>
<p>Avrach: We should accept everyone?</p>
<p>Rav- This concern for the lowly can only be understood as part of imatatio dei. As I said two lectures ago- one can only approach God as a lonely being, as a sinner, forsaken by everyone. Not as Judge Kaufman did in his power. God humbles himself to abide with the individual- the poor and oppressed.&nbsp; Isaiah 66:1-2 the heaven is my throne – where will I dwell &#8212; poor, contrite spirit. Kabblah calls this infinite and humility eyn sof and zimzum, God contracts himself.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Sabbath, Jews quote R. Yohanan- wherever you find his greatness, you find his humbleness. In Psalms, we say “He never takes a bribe, humble to help poor and orphan.”</p>
<p>Does the president invite ordinary people to his table?.&nbsp; Eleanor Roosevelt said about her husband – “I cant relax around people less educated than me. Me too.[Rav speaking about himself] &nbsp;And I suppose the less educated person does not fell confortable in my company.</p>
<p>But God can dwell with poor and ignorant. It is an ability to be around uncultured. A person comes to the rabbi with primitive ideas and with superstition. I know the boundary between religion and superstition, which people don’t know. Instead, they come with foolish questions. A woman comes to me and says her husband dies and his spirit is still in the house because she puts away the dishes and in the morning they are in a different place. She is obviously elderly and forgets where she puts the dishes. If you look down upon the person who comes to you then you can’t have patience. You need to have inner esteem of the ignoble spirit as much as the noble spirit.</p>
