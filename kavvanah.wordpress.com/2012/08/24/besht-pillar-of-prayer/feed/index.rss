					<description><![CDATA[There seems to be a not-so-subtle subtext to Odenheimer&#039;s review, and Kallus&#039;s book too.  They are pushing a &quot;new spiritual paradigm&quot;.

The reviewer writes:

&quot;An essay by Rabbi Miles Krassen [affilated with the Jewish Renewal  movement and former professor at a Tibetan Buddhist university], a scholar of Jewish mysticism and of comparative religion, introduces Kallus’ translation and commentary with a convincing presentation of the Baal Shem Tov as the avatar of a new spiritual paradigm wholly relevant for our times.&quot;

&quot;In a long essay at the end of the book, Rabbi Aubrey Glazer... shows how tales of the Baal Shem Tov’s journey are entwined with symbolism that hint at the existence of an ongoing dialogue of religious imaginations
in which Sufism and Hasidism share both geographical and spiritual space − that new paradigm toward which both Krassen and Kallus are pointing.&quot;

&quot;The book is part of a series called Spiritual Affinities, initiated by Glazer
for the scholarly interfaith publisher Fons Vitae, dedicated to emphasizing such shared spaces and the often subterranean or even subconscious conversations between religions, in which spiritual traditions influence and inspire each other without fully admitting or even being cognizant of this cross-fertilization and exchange.&quot;


Both Kallus and Krassen are rabbis who were ordained by the leader of the Renewal movement.  That leader is well known for his affinity to Buddhism, and many of his ordained students take on practices from other religions and strongly identify with other religions.

One of the primary foundations of the Besht and the Ari was their insistence on the observance of every one of the Torah&#039;s commandments.  

In my opinion, Odenheimer and Kallus and Glazer seem to really love the Besht&#039;s cool &quot;spiritual&quot; practices - especially when they can find parallels in Sufism or Buddhism or perhaps any other religion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/besht-pillar-of-prayer/#comment-6699&quot;&gt;zjb&lt;/a&gt;.

The text collects all the statements attributed to the Besht. Most of it consists of the statements found in the two main followers of the Besht, Rabbi Yakov Yosef of Polnoye and Rabbi Dov Baer of Mezritch. As a scholarly tool, it allows one to compare the way the each formulates the same statement. The former added greater context from Safed piety and used the metaphors of father-son, or princess- the latter more panentheism and king-prince metaphors. The collection also included versions in other seforim, as well as 19th century versions. It even included versions of Besht statements received in 19th century prophecy in the school of Komarno. But everything is clearly labeled and you can always go back to the originals. It is an early 20th century work collecting prior statements. 

The bottom of the page in the Hebrew is a commentary connected the passages to kabbalah and to discussions in later Hasidim. The commentary relies on Galican material and much Komarno. In contrast, Scholem, Green et. al. are more concerned with Chabad and Breslov, who understandings play less of a role in the commentary. The commentary is also more kabbalistic than the taste of the academics. 
On the Galician dynasty Komarno- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komarno_(Hasidic_dynasty)
Kallus uses much of the commentary for both its Lurianic context of the passages as well as Komarno&#039;s visionary mediation tradition. 
Here is an example of a komarno meditation, one of almost 300 from the Komarno source.

					<description><![CDATA[Alan, I was wondering if you could help me with a crude stumbling block I&#039;m having here. It sounds like a great volume and I like how you are reading it as a set of claims about prayer and religious devotion, and I&#039;ll be happy to read it as such. What I don&#039;t get though is something more positivist. I have no problems with Shivhei ha&#039;Besht. I know what it is, a late recesnsion. What then &quot;is&quot; and whose is the Amud ha&#039;Tefilah? What kind of a thing are we looking at here, in terms of date, place, authorships, and redaction? Thanks for any light you might be able to cast here.]]></description>
