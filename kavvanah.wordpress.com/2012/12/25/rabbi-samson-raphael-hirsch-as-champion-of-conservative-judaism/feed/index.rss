S.

I wanted to comment on your post there, but comments are no more. Re the 1959 Feldheim edition which no longer mentioned Drachman&#039;s affiliation with JTS - I wonder if that was more due to Drachman&#039;s falling out with JTS. Feldheim did, after all, publish Saul Lieberman&#039;s Greek/ Hellenism in Jewish Palestine originally - both after 1959.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few years ago Penn created a website with Morais&#039; ledger, a very large collection of clippings, pamphlets etc that he collected, and that reflect his own experiences and life. You can see it here http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/morais/ and fwiw, while the Reform thinker Samuel Hirsch appears several times, SR Hirsch doesn&#039;t at all. 
I agree with you that Morais and more broadly the role of the Sephardic (for lack of a better word) legacy in American Jewish history deserves to be better understood.]]></description>
