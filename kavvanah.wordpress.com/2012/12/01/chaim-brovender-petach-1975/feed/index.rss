					<description><![CDATA[Maimonides in his introduction to the perush ha&#039;mishnayos seems to say that there are two sorts of incorrect prophecy.

1) In which the navi deliberately lies (Maimonides uses the word &#039;sheker&#039; here. It is an outright lie.)

2) In which the navi is able to foretell some aspect of the future through necromancy etc. however because the source of the information is not G-d there will always be misinformation mixed into the prediction. Here he uses the term &#039;chazav&#039; which seems to denote deviation from the truth as opposed to an outright lie.

However Maimonides says that for a Navi Hashem - a prophet of G-d, the prophecy will always be 100% accurate and through this we can differentiate between the false prophet (who must be killed) and the prophet of G-d.

If a prophet makes a good prediction that does not materialise with 100% accuracy then he is a false prophet. This is because if G-d says that something good will happen to someone / people via a prophet then He will never go back on His word. (This applies specifically to prophecy for the good because if a bad prediction does not materialise this may be because G-d had mercy and annulled the decree.)

Subsequently I still do not understand the argument comparing prophecy to &#039;daas torah&#039;;
- If the prophet is a prophet of G-d then indeed his prophecy is infallible. This is a law of the means by which G-d chooses to communicate with humanity.

- If the prophet is a false prophet then he will either lie outright or he will use dubious methods to predict the future. This is prohibited by the Torah on pain of death and always includes some innacuracy.

Neither of these categories seem to have any bearing on the concept of &#039;daas torah&#039;. Here we are discussing the advice of a G-d fearing man who earnestly attempts to abide by the Torah&#039;s guidance. This person has a specific understanding of life, generational psychodynamics and reality that hopefully in a large part has been imbued in him through his pursuit of G-dly wisdom.

The quesion of whether his advice is fallible or infallible seems to have no bearing to the fact that a prophet can deliberately choose to tell either an outright lie or to use necromancy et al to predict the future and pass this off as the word of G-d revealed to him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Chacham adif mi&#039;navi, so we see that a navi does not need to be a chacham. Also it is evident from chazal that when one navi experiences a nevuah then all neviim know of it but they know that they are not meant to transmit it (so they will know if the other navi is kovesh nevuasoh).

A navi has access to knowing new reality that Hashem has introduced to the world before it has been physically instantiated.

It is apparent from the fact that there is such a thing as a navi sheker that it is possible to &#039;pick up&#039; incorrect messages (or pseudo appearances of new reality) in which case you will be in danger of becoming a navi sheker (and possibly not knowing that you are one). I would imagine that there is a tremendous amount of control required when perceiving nevuah to direct yourself to the true nevuah and not fall into receiving sheker.

This does not seem to have anything to do with the question of whether a chacham based on their understanding of the world and all that is in it can extrapolate the right way to proceed using currently available information.
