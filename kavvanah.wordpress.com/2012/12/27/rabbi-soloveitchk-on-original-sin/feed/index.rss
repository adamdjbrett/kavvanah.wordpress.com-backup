Thanks
Do you have handy the relevant parts of your “Letter to the Editor” in TUMJ 14?
Do you think the Cohen and Brunner versions complement each other or are in tension?
What is your estimated year for the writing of EEM?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A very iluminating analysis. It seems to me, however, that while in EEM the Rav, as you have so clearly shown, was influenced by Brunner, in his view of orignal sin in LMF, &quot;Confrontation,&quot; and Worship of the Heart he folllows Hermann Cohen&#039;s interpretation of Guide 1: 2, acording to whom Maimonides is asserting that man&#039;s sin consisted in the abandonment of the intellectual-ethical for the esthetic. I have discussed this in my &quot;Letter to the Editor&quot; in TUMJ 14. Indeed, as I noted there, Professor Avi Ravitzky relates that he once asked the Rav in private oonversation why he favored this interpretation of the Guide, and his first response was &quot;This is the way Hermann Cohen explains it.&quot; In any event, thank you for debunking the popular notion that &quot;original sin&quot; is necessarily a non-Jewish  Christian concept.]]></description>
