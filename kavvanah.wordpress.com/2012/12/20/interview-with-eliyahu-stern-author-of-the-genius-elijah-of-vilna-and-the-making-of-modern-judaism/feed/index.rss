					<description><![CDATA[In perusing Stern&#039;s book, I stumbled across the following gem (the likes of which this book is no doubt full). In discussing the brevity of the Biur ha-gra, Stern refers to one comment of the Gaon: 
&quot;For example, when Karo interprets the biblical injunction against sacrificing an animal with its child as referring to specific animals, Elijah comments: &#039;See there [Chullin] 79b and in the Midrashic work Torat Kohanim [Emor, section 8, chapter 7]. But Rabbi Isaac Alfasi [Chullin 27b] and Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel [Chullin chapter 4, topic 3] say it also refers to a bull and not a non-domesticated animal, a sheep nor chickens.&quot; 
Reading this, I was puzzled: how could Rabbi Isaac Alfasi say that the injunction does not apply to sheep, does it not say explicitly ושור או שה אותו ואת בנו לא תשחטו ביום אחד? 
Looking up the original comment of the Gaon, I found the following: The Shulhan Arukh (Yoreh Deah 16:7) says אין איסור אותו ואת בנו אלא בבהמה טהורה בלבד, שנאמר: ושור או שה אותו ואת בנו לא תשחטו ביום אחד. On this, the Gaon comments: אין איסור כו&#039;. שם ע&quot;ט ב&#039; ובת&quot;כ והביאו הרי&quot;ף והרא&quot;ש שור ולא חיה שה ולא עופות. (To translate: &quot;Ibid. 79b and in Torat Kohanim, cited by R. Alfasi and R. Asher, &#039;An ox and non a non-domesticated animal, a sheep and not birds&#039;.&quot;) Stern&#039;s interpretation, which is infinitely more creative, sees here not a reference, but a dispute about the parameters of the mitzvah, with the majority of the opinions on which the Shulhan arukh is based siding against a pasuk. I think this is the only example Stern gives of a halakhic comment of the Gaon. Anyone can write a book on the Gaon, but only Stern could have written &quot;The Genius.&quot;]]></description>

One of the many things done well over at Alan Brill&#039;s blog are the interviews. This one is with Eli Stern about his just published book about the modernity of the Vilna Gaon. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m going to be persuaded, but it&#039;s all going to depend on what one means by &quot;modernity&quot; and what a CentralEuro centric like myself ends up learning about the Vilna Gaon. I&#039;m already beginning to think that Stern is onto something. Will report back later.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[- The gr&quot;a went into galus for a number of years to gather old minhagim which he felt were disapearing so it would be absurd to say that he was the progenitor of an attitude where text wins out over custom.

 - The intention of the gr&quot;a seems to have been to determine the kavanah rishonah of the Torah which is why for example both Brisk who emphasise study of the Rishonim and the Mussar movement which stresses the holistic view of balancing observance of &#039;G-d centric&#039; mitzvos with the observance of inter-personal mitzvos stem from the gr&quot;a. This is because both of these movements sought to determine the kavanah rishonah of the Torah, one in Torah study and the other in the area of personal growth.

- The gr&quot;a&#039;s brother in Maalos ha&#039;Torah says that it is impossible that the purpose of man is intellectual Torah accomplishment because then man would be better off never being born since more Torah is available in the womb / olam habah than is available in our worldly state. Similarly the gr&quot;a in Shir ha&#039;Shirim says that the ultimate reward for Torah observance is not in olam habah but is rather to perceive Hashem through the beauty of this world (which is why the Torah does not mention olam habah as a reward). It is therefore unlikely that the gr&quot;a championed being absorbed in Torah study alone (however scintilatingly brilliant or prodigial) without translating this into an uplifting of everyday life.]]></description>
