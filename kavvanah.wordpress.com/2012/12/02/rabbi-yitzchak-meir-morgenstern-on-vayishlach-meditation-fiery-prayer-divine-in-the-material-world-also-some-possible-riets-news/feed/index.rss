A very basic aspect of Judasim is that we have an emotional relationship with G-d; ve&#039;ahavta es Hashem elokechah

Going on about technical definitions of who we are and who G-d is in respect to this would seem to have as much relevance as a mother being by her child &quot;Do you love me?&quot; and responding &quot;What is love?&quot;

Essentially the bone that I am picking with the article that has been quoted is that I am entitled as a Jew to go to shul and say &quot;Hello G-d.&quot; Telling me that there is some massive conceptual gap between me and G-d is driving G-d away from the Jewish people rather than drawing them closer to Him.]]></description>

I haven&#039;t read more than a few pieces of Nefesh haChaim, but that sounds like a very different view from that espoused by chasidim, esp. Lubavitch (see Loewenthal, Elior, Wolfson et al on Habad acosmism/immanence).

The Lubavitch &quot;higher unity&quot; in which we are all part of God, we just can&#039;t perceive it because of the tzimtzum (that shades our perception of our own Godliness), is how they interpret &quot;ein od milvado&quot;.  While what you describe is more like the ideology with which I grew up as a schoolchild at Ramaz, that God is involved in all of creation, giving it a flow of existence.  It&#039;s like a light bulb - it doesn&#039;t make light without a constant flow of electricity, but it has physical existence even without the power being on.  So too the universe would be cold and dead without a flow of God-life-power (shefa), but it would still have independent existence once God had created it.

Do I understand you correctly?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Moshe, I am a currently a student at Yeshiva University, and am in my fifth semester here. Most of the students that I&#039;ve encountered are only aware of the existence of Rabbis Bleich and Tendler insomuch as they work here, and not any intellectual or hashkafic level. It&#039;s certainly not the level of profile needed to imbue the institution&#039;s spirit with the legacy of the Rav. As for Rabbi Shachter, if he is indeed carrying on the legacy of the Rav, does so with an extremely narrow perspective, or so it seems to me. There seems to no convergence of the twain between those invested in the Y and those in the U these days. This new hire doesn&#039;t seem to bode well in that department.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Judeo Philaeus: I don&#039;t think that Rav Morgenstern is distancing himself from Abulafia - he&#039;s aligned with many gedolim of the past and encompasses a lot of shittos.

					<description><![CDATA[Is the intellectualism of Rav Soloveitchik and Rav Lichtenstein still there? I personally do not think it is. It might exist in a few people there, but those people have and always will have their followers (few and far between). On a grand scale, the institution would benefit more if it stopped trying to capture what it does not have anymore, and focus on what the majority are looking for. There is no shame in that. Food for thought on your last paragraph.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Rb Chaim Volozhin (nephesh ha&#039;chaim) the concepts of ein od milvado and Hashem hu ha&#039;Elokim mean that there is no aspect of creation which is minutely divorced from Hashem&#039;s involvement therein. This would seem to be a foundational aspect of Jewish belief and repudiates the idea of Enosh that God is too loft to be involved directly in our lowly affairs.

Why would we think that we need to pray with fiery devotion in order to bridge the (almost) unbridgeable gap between ourselves and the &#039;higher worlds&#039;? Surely when I pray, the presence of God is before me and directly addressable?]]></description>
