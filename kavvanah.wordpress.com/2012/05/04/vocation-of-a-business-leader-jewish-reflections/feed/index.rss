					<description><![CDATA[The philosophical  issues involved in teleological ethics, and the  Catholic conception of welfare, needs and the common good deserve more  than a comment. Rather than even try, I want to concentrate  on the difficulties of applying such ideas. The difficulty is acknowledged when they say “The Church’s magisterium does not have technical solutions to offer or models to present”. Three examples: 1) Once we have open competitive markets, then any price that is the market price is the just price. Is there today a just price for the Euro and the Yen, tuna fish and Prada shoes other than the market price? Market prices might have distributive consequences, but those are best addressed by a tax system, not by setting individual prices by administrative control. Today there is virtually no country that maintains centralized decisions and pricing  would provide a better allocation of goods than the markets. Similar problems exist with the ideas of a just return. Capitalism cannot function if each and every industry is treated  as a utility. 2) The document makes no mention of  labor unions, class struggles, the influences of ideologies. Nor are there discussions of tax policy, fiscal and monetary policy welfare nets, and the role governments play  in solving domestic and global problems. It is all variations of noblesse oblige, privilege entails responsibility, this time the privileges afforded to a Christian capitalist, and the teaching of the Church regarding his obligations. Perhaps in feudal times all contradictions in society would have become manageable if the ruling class would have lived a proper Christian life. Can we in all seriousness believe such would happen today in a global economy?  Consider outsourcing where workers in high wage countries lose, (thus creating even greater domestic inequality,) but workers in poor countries benefit even more. How then do we reconcile global justice with justice within a nation? How do we decide on a fair allocation between generations, especially in a world with peak oil and global warming? Many of the ideas in the document are pre-capitalist in origin, and were swept away with the rise of markets, credit and paper money, and then again by the triumph of the bourgeoisie.  These Catholic doctrines do not provide answers to such tradeoffs. 3)The idea of producing goods that truly serve is problematic. If Kraft,  Estee Lauder or the Las Vegas corporations were run on these principles, would they self destruct?  French and Italian  exports depend on luxury items. Following these ideas, puts Italy in an even worse position than Greece. Who decides which company and by extension which country shall live and which will die. (Think about Chavez and how he is rationing imports by the criteria of human need. Is the Catholic position that there should be different exchange rates depending on the need for the item, as in Venezuela, and will the markets then clear by having a parallel black market exchange rate?) The document provides no clue.]]></description>
