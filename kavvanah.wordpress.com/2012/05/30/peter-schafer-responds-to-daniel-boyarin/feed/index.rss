					<description><![CDATA[I thought it was interesting when he said that the cannanite gods ba&#039;al and el were trying to be combined in the bible. But we forget that Abraham met YHVH far from the land, then came to canaan. is it too much to suggest that the opposite happened? And thier culture did this often, is it to much to suggest the cannanites thought the two names were seperate Gods and seperated them, rather than the bible combine them? Its only a suggestion. And if you say the canaanite Gods are older, your using a dating method that dated the Dead sea scrolls before Jesus, but dated two parts of a mamoth two very different dates, and a living seal at a couple thousand!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RE:  Peter Schafer&#039;s quote in &quot;The Mirror of His Beauty&quot; (2002) p. 36.:
&quot;Herself unchanging ~ she makes all things new&quot; ~

&quot;Herself unchanging ~ she makes all things new&quot;  is actually from
&quot;Sophia of the Bible&quot; by Aurora Terrenus.  (1986) (p. 64)

This is my own interpretation of The Wisdom of Solomon 7:27-28,
which reads: 
&quot;Though she is but one, she can do all things and
while remaining in herself, she renews all things.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Daniel 7:13 might actually say &quot;I saw in visions of night, and behold, a people of clouds of heaven like a son of man is coming...&quot;
The word &quot;people&quot; is spelled ayin mem just  like the word &quot;with&quot; in &quot;with clouds of heaven&quot;. The angel told Daniel that the kingdom would be given to the people, so maybe the vision was of a people made up of clouds coming to get the kingdom. The other creatures in the visions were also strange.

I think the angel called the angel of the L-rd in the Hebrew Bible that sometimes speaks like it was G-d was the angel of G-d&#039;s presence from Isaiah 63:9. I think G-d&#039;s name was His presence that He put in an angel, and then that angel could either speak for Him saying &quot;thus says the L-rd...&quot; or He could speak directly through it&#039;s mouth to people like through a telephone. I think that is what Numbers 12:8 meant by G-d speaking &quot;mouth to mouth by Moses&quot;. He could put HIs mouth to Moses&#039; mouth and speak through him also maybe.

I don&#039;t know if Boyarin discusses these possibilities in his book, but I think they are possible explanations.
