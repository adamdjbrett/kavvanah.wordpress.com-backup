He deals with Mauss in a single paragraph and turns the Christian connotations such as Jesus into scapegoat victim and Augustine into proto-Maimonidean Teshuvah. The book avoids many of the associations that come to our minds. It is strongest for the second part as a modern ethical statement, a textual application of Levinas as sacrfice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, alan. Do you or anyone else think this might present a problem with the conceptualization of the book? To me, it&#039;s big difference. A sacrifice is one thing --the gift you give to God and sometimes get to eat. It&#039;s an object-phenomenon. But in English, it&#039;s loaded up with a lot of pious moralizing about the self. Devotion of soul (ok, a bad translation) has a different resonance to me, maybe because there is no precise equivalent in English. Please let me know if I&#039;m not getting this right, or if this is worth pursuing.]]></description>

no, its not. but he seems to be using the word korban for self-sacrifice, altruism, caritas and a number of other words.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m genuinely confused and hope someone can clarify something. Is &quot;sacrifice&quot;(korban, zevachim) the same thing in Hebrew as &quot;mesirat nefesh,&quot; &quot;kiddush ha&#039;shem&quot; or any other indigenous term for same? And if this is true in the medieval period (response to Crusader massacres), is it true of rabbinic literatures or biblical ones? I&#039;m thinking &quot;sacrifice for&quot; might be a very bad concept for what MH is getting at, even if the link between one and the other makes intuitive sense in English.]]></description>
