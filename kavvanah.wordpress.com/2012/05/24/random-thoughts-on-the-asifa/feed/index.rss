Dr. Brill,
Couldn&#039;t find anything definitive online, so I emailed Michael Mittleman, the Director of Celebrate Israel.  Here was his full response:
&quot;NYPD doesn’t keep statistics of crowd estimates like the type you are looking for.  That’s why we estimate that we have hundreds of thousands of spectators and leave it at that.&quot;

What gets me is that so many speakers at the asifa (reportedly) referenced the fact that so many Jews at one gathering gave the event some sacred/halachic status making pronouncements at the gathering binding.  But even by fairly conservative estimates, just a few weeks later three or four times as many Jews were at one gathering.  Does that give the parade some sacred/halachic status?  (Though I suspect various asifa speakers might not consider many of the parade attendees to be Jews...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The Celebrate Israel day parade which has become the Modern Orthodox pride parade gets over 30, 000.&quot;

Dr. Brill,
The parade gets over 30,000 MARCHERS.  Attendees are estimated in the hundreds of thousands. (The organizers say around a million but don&#039;t provide a source).  That&#039;s a lot of asifas!

&quot;When they have used the words &quot;klal yisroel&quot; in the last decade, you were not included.&quot;

I find this interesting because many outside the Haredi world have a definition of &quot;Jews&quot; that includes both them and the Haredi.  Would these organizers have some different term, aside from &quot;klal yisroel,&quot; that also includes the MO, or the Conservative and Reform, for that matter?  

I have heard in Flatbush the term &quot;Torah Jews,&quot; referring apparently to Orthodoxy minus MO.  People who use that term appear to be acknowledging that others are still Jewish -- they&#039;re just unfaithful to Torah.    

This speaker, however, appears not even to consider others Jews at all.  One thing that keeps non-Haredi Jews willing to support Haredi institutions is that they don&#039;t feel personally de-legitimized.  So I&#039;m curious whether that line truly has been drawn.]]></description>

cyberdov,
The event was announced by Rav Matisyahu Solomon and the Skulner Rebbe- you are not part of that world on many levels. The content of the asifos from 2005-2011 are available online- there were no surprises. There are even fine summaries on blogs. They were gathering all the Haredi groups to attend. When they have used the words &quot;klal yisroel&quot; in the last decade, you were not included. 
The big update is that there was a individual, maybe several, who do kiruv and are Haredi now but come from more modern backgrounds who were self-appointed organizers. They seem to have called lots of pulpit rabbis and OU/YI type individuals saying that this is for you. They made statements about content and organization that the Skulner Rebbe would never agree to. From the organizers of Rav Salomon and the Skulner, it never was for you. Why this person did what he did, i will leave to politics and psychology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s worth pointing to the MO/modernist ideology that underlies the response/ridicule of the Asifa: the idea that technology is morally neutral- a mere tool - and all that matters is how it is used. In contrast one of the main speakers at the Asifa (the charismatic guy who was mostly on topic the whole time) emphasized that some  technologies are not neutral, they are in fact socially disruptive, and these disruptions may undermine forms of religious life, social relationships, and how we relate to God and Torah.

Even if technological change is a fait accompli, the tools we use can profoundly change the tool-users and I very much wish that the MO would take this seriously instead of pretending that they have already meaningfully engaged these issues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;However, it is important to note that there were 1930’s Eastern European rabbis, even some Agudah members, who were proud that they and their students resisted electricity, light bulbs, telephones, beds, and indoor plumbing. There were strong Luddite and anti-medicine trends before the war.&#039;

Thanks for your reflections, are you able to elaborate further concerning the Luddite tendency that existed in the 1930&#039;s? I&#039;m curious to know more about the history of Jewish reponse to change particulary from the perspective of the Rabbis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good thought provoking post, Alan! I actually do not think that the modern Orthodox reaction was out of proportion. Modern orthodoxy responds constantly to things that the right does. The more soft-spoken and thoughtful the right&#039;s position, the more likely they modern Orthodox response to be soft-spoken and thoughtful. The more bombastic, self-righteous, public, and attention-getting the right&#039;s behavior, the more likely they modern Orthodox response to be ridicule. 

Just a thought!]]></description>

Lawrence: Are you so confident that MO rabbis don&#039;t speak about their rulings as being binding on all Israel?  There may be more nuance, but that is arguably the bottom line position of many who self-identify as RWMO.

------

In a related vein, I was struck today by a passage in Peter Schjeldal’s review of the Barnes in the current New Yorker:  &quot;This special character of the Barnes is germane to debates about &#039;reception theory&#039; in art history and &#039;relational aesthetics&#039; in performance-based art.  Those dry terms skirt a widespread dissatisfaction with the modernist dogma of art’s hermetic autonomy […]  The notion that art and life are somehow separate has worn out.&quot;]]></description>
