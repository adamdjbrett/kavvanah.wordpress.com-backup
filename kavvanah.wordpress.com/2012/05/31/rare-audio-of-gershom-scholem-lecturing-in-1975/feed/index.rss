True, I did not listen, because I would not understand him. I relied on your able representation. The point, however, is that Scholem misunderstood the source. If you like, he misunderstood it two times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[avakesh, you did not even bother listening to the lecture. Scholem quotes the full version. oy. 
 Zinberg is entirely dependent on Scholem. He was just quoting from Scholem of the 1920&#039;s,not his post-Ernaos version of 50 years later. Psychology was the lingo of the 1970&#039;s. What you are really noting is how Scholem&#039;s presentation changed over 50 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan, I think I may have been in attendance at that lecture, or perhaps a similar one given a year or two prior at B.U. While my field was not Jewish studies, I had spent time in Israel by then and done a fair amount of reading of Judaica, including a number of Scholem&#039;s essays on various topics. I certainly knew of his stature as a scholar and didn&#039;t want to miss the opportunity to be in his presence.

As I remember, the (large) lecture hall was packed, and it was very difficult to hear Scholem clearly, particularly with his strong accent and the frequency of terms from a variety of languages. To be honest, I found the lecture somewhere between impenetrable and incomprehensible, as did my wife, who had been a graduate student in Jewish History at Harvard (and for a year at Hebrew U.) and had German and far better Hebrew than I. There have been very few lectures in my career as an academic that I understood less well.

Oh well.

 I&#039;ve done considerably better with Scholem&#039;s published work in English translation.

I am curious how Scholem&#039;s students found him as a teacher (as distinct from a scholar), and how Israelis did with his public lectures in Hebrew.]]></description>
