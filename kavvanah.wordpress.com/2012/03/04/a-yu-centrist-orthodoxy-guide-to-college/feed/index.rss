					<description><![CDATA[While it is more fun to spin fancy theories about the choices made in the document, allow me to suggest a very pragmatic explanation: they wrote about the professions that most of their readership are in and wanted to provide guidance; klei kodesh isn&#039;t there because those people already approach parnassah as avodas Hashem; physics is there to try to break the mold a little and get people to consider non-obvious options.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have never heard of a reasonable justification for a yid to go to medical school when there be close to 100% certainty that the individual will have to be mechallel shabbos on a regular basis. Even more so for a kohen that will not only dissect bodies but will have to regularly go into hospitals and come into contact with meisim.

Yeah, once someone is already a doctor there is an issue of pikuach nefesh. But what heter is there for choosing medicine in the first place? Wish I could ask Rambam or Ramban...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up at a time when there was a sense of fun and high spirits in the culture, in part because of the opposition to the Vietnam War and the general leftist student ferment that was taking place in many countries.  I thought, naively perhaps, it was possible to combine parnassah, learning and adventure, and sail through life having a fine time. In the fast track MO world of today it appears even the very smart brilliant people don’t think of play, adventure and excitement; it’s responsibility all the way down. Is this because of an anxiety  left over from the post war refugees and survivors of not having everything settled and orderly, or is it a certain pessimism about possibilities? Whatever the cause the externalities to this superego crunch are enormous. 

These straightjacket attitudes carry over to their occupational choices. There is no mention in this document of big bucks, no aspirations to become a Rothschild or a Sassoon, though the document is about parnassah. Business, entrepreneurial adventures, real estate, trading and finance are not foreign to today’s chassidic community, have always been part of traditional Jewish occupations and allow plenty of time with the wife and kiddies. But they lack the same bourgeois cache as a doctor, the job security of an actuary or the respectability of a lawyer. And the outcome is uncertain…they all contain an element of gambling, play and adventure. Tracking people so they never have to take a chance is to my way of thinking bad advice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The way I read the document, and its emphasis on taking college and career advancement seriously (as opposed to &quot;pattering up&quot; - has YU become THAT yeshivish?), I see it as an attempt to respond to the phenomenon of kids from centrist families choosing places like Touro, Landerer, and particularly Ner Yisroel, without considering the long term consequences.  For that reason, academia, the arts, etc are not considered, but neither is a BTL.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This document is centrist, but represents the right wing of YU where careers are ultimately about lifestyle and money, and intellectual development and creativity are supposed to find expression in ones religious pursuits and nostalgia for yeshiva. Hence the lack of academia, public service, the arts, etc. 

It also reflects a sense that even day school-&#062;yeshiva in Israel-&#062;YU leads to significantly different religious trajectories. Some people end up not religious, some end up thoroughly modern orthodox, and only some gravitate to the lifestyle of the yeshiva boy out in the world who evaluates his religious life by the yardstick he was handed in yeshiva (and all three types come out of the same &quot;good&quot; yeshivas, the same majors, etc.) This document speaks to the guy who wants a good job but fears ending up like peers whose religious lives he considers far from ideal. (I assume Jewish ed was left out because that career is thought to involve lifelong religious engagement).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m being almost self-parodying here, but I can&#039;t help but note the career options they omit: Jewish education (it&#039;s a career and a profession too), Jewish communal service (ditto), academia (aside from, oddly, physics), public service-gov&#039;t, the arts, and needless to say, Aliyah is just not on the table. 
it&#039;s not only because those alumni are not going to grow your endowment fund. For years I&#039;ve been saying that YU&#039;s fundamental de facto mission is creating an American Orthodox middle class. That&#039;s not dishonorable, but it is what it is.  It&#039;s a mix of Litvak ideology (with the intellectual etc strivings channeled in that direction) and Hirschian sociology (without Hirsch&#039;s moral pathos).  
That being said, much of what they write here is sensible, and even, as far as the frameworks go, humane.]]></description>
