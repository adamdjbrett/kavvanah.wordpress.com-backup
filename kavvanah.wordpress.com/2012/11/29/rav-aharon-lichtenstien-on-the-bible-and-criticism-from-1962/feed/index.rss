It&#039;s hard to judge when it would have the most impact.  Earlier (before extremism took hold as much in mainstream Judaism) would have been better, but R&#039; Lichtenstein may not have been as respected then, either...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would love to see the article if you have access to it digitally.
My understanding is Rav Aharon gave the essay to Aviva Zorenberg many years later - after it was written - and her response was, that had he published it at the time - in the early 1960&#039;s it would have been very significant (academically), However in the meantime, others arrived at similar conclusions and expressed themselves in depth making his article relativity &quot;unimportant&quot; . However I think we know that if say Robert Alter (who was working on his phd in Harvard at more or less the same time) has  an opinion about studying the Bible as Literature - it will not have the same impact in certain circles as Rav Aharon.]]></description>
