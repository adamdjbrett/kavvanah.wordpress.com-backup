I agree the argument is mostly about what is lost, but the discussion so far was rather unrooted as it ignored this significant contextual factor. 
You could argue death being longer/shorter either way - slow progress of chronic debilitating diseases and extension of life by intervention - is this the process of death or process of intervention?, but that is not directly relevant to point made, i.e. technological change explaining the development of moment of death  as a concept.]]></description>

The question isn&#039;t whether it&#039;s legitimate, it&#039;s what gets lost sight of. In any event, the technological reality is that death has become a longer, not shorter, process so focusing on the moment fails to deal with that reality as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is this re-framing of death not a legitimate response to technological change ? The focus on  moment of death and ICU death reflect the technological reality, not present to anything like the same extent pre 1940, that medicine can often prevent or delay death. It makes sense to view death as  5 day process if you can do nothing to stop its progress. Moment of death is much more relevant when you need to identify when technology has in fact lost the fight. Surely Judaism&#039;s focus on the importance of life, a dominant historical thread, makes Jacobovits and Lamms refocusing in the light of technological change a sensible move ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am curious what your sense is of what is &quot;done&quot; in the non-&quot;modern&quot; orthodox world.  From my limited experience I think there is more preservation of things like saying shema, etc, w a dying person , even an unconscious one (have not heard viduy but maybe that too), and not leaving them alone.  But there is also the same attitude of death as a medical failure, everything up to the moment being about its prevention, etc.  
the HK asked mehila of my father in Israel in the way AS describes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The sacred IS being brought back to death. It is slow, but we are making progress.

The beginning of the revolution can be traced to the 1970’s and the confluence of the Federal Trade Commission and Jessica Mitford challenging and de-mystifying the post-civil war American funeral process. Rabbi Arnold Goodman’s Chevra Kevod Hamet and a smattering of other synagogues began the process of taking back the mitzvot of caring for the body and soul at the end of life. Centered on community, volunteers doing tahara, but also including shmira, sometimes making tachrichim and aronim, and sometimes establishing alternatives to the traditional Jewish funeral home, we are working to bring back an elevated spiritual component beginning with the post-death experience.

In 2000 the creation of the Kavod v’Nichum and in 2010 the start of Chevra Kadisha leadership training in the Gamliel Institute enhanced the Chevra Kadisha movement by providing extensive resources and educational opportunities to take Chevra Kadisha work beyond on-the-job training to an area rich with text study, writings, discussion and research. Expanding in both directions of the death time-line, Chevra Kadisha work is reconstructing the original Prague Chevra Kadisha model and is incorporating bikkur cholim, legacy work, remembrance and viddui at the end of life, while at the same time building on tahara and shmira to include enhancing shiva services to embrace storytelling and providing meals for the family modeled on sheva brachot.  

One way to measure a movement is by its scope and vitality. Chevra Kadisha work draws participants because it often leads to strong spiritual experiences. A disproportionately high number of converts and non-heterosexuals are involved in Chevra Kadisha. A new extensive liturgical analysis of the Tahara liturgy attracted 130 participants in a recent webinar. Recent conferences have fully engaged in exploring issues around transgender and tahara.  Burial vs. cremation is an active discussion topic. There is a move to develop a ritual washing liturgy for non-Jewish spouses.

By fully immersing ourselves in the hope that a grass roots effort can make significant change, the Chevra Kadisha movement is bringing the sacred back to death.

					<description><![CDATA[The current Reform Rabbi handbook has the following vidui- it does seem to be stressed in their literature and the Jewish Lights volumes.

Reform Rabbis&#039; handbook:

My God and God of all who have gone before me, Author of life and death, I turn to You in trust. Although I pray for life and health, I know that I am mortal. If my life must soon come to and end, let me die, I pray, at peace. If only my hands were clean and my heart pure! I confess that I have committed sins and left much undone, yet I know also the good that I did or tried to do. May my acts of goodness give meaning to my life, and may my errors be forgiven. Protector of bereaved and the helpless, watch over my loved ones. Into Your hand I commit my spirit; redeem it, O God of mercy and truth.]]></description>

The only source I came across was the EJ entry on burial which provides no explanation. Beyond that I didn&#039;t look into it. I can only speculate that it was abolished because  there is something strange to the modern sensibility in publicly addressing a dead person in the second person.

In the US I&#039;ve never been at a funeral where a representative of the hevra kadisha did so in public and my impression is that it is done privately after the tahara. But this may be because the hevra kadisha finishes its job long before burial when it transfers the body to the funeral home or cemetery. In Israel I&#039;ve seen a member of the HK make the announcement publicly after the burial as something like:  &quot;ploni b. ploni, we have conducted ourselves according the customs of the HK of Jerusalem, we ask mehila if we slighted you or treated you improperly.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AS- These posts are a crowd sourcing submission to the same volume.
Where is the source that Rabbi Adler abolished the practice? Did he give a reason? 

In the US, we have Greenwald and Hamadrich still having the practice in the 1950&#039;s and then gone in 69 in Lamm.
Anyone know any other relevant sources? Anyone have pre-1965 Reform and Conservative guides to death handy?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you might remember, this is a failure within Jewish medical ethics I attempt to partialy address in an article that is supposed to appear in the IRF&#039;s (forthcoming?) book on organ donation. Hopefully it will be published at some point. 

It may be worth noting that the abolition of traditional death rituals began earlier in England. In 1887 RIJ&#039;s predecessor, Chief Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler, abolished the practice of the hevra kadisah asking the deceased for forgiveness.

Also, it is unfair to pin so much on RIJ when virtually everything written on death and mourning in English for popular audiences, at least from Maurice Lamm&#039;s 1969 book onward, ignores the soul and recasts all the mourning rituals in modern psychological terms.]]></description>
