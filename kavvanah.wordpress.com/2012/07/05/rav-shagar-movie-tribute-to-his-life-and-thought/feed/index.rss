					<description><![CDATA[I thank you for posting this especially to an English-language audience. 
I submitted a doctoral thesis recently (Univ. Haifa) on Contemporary Orthodox Jewish theology in Israel and Postmodern philosophy, in which I compared the writings of Harav Shagar and Prof Tamar Ross. This is probably one of the first academic pieces on Harav Shagar written in English. I set the context of why his thinking and writings are currently significant and popular in Israel, rather than on the &#039;existentialist angst&#039; presented in the film.
I know this blog is not for self-publicity ( :-) ) but if anyone is interested in knowing more about him from a philosophical and theological perspective, I would be delighted to share.

Nehemia,
Can you spell out your second paragraph? What are the spiritual vectors to neo-liberalism in Israel? Your left leaning scholars is a bit oblique, can you spell it out in academic terms?]]></description>

Some left-leaning scholars relate Israel&#039;s emerging economic and social neo-liberalism to changes, in what they call, Jewish fundamentalism, Gush Emunim, religious Zionism, etc. What they miss (because they don&#039;t look very hard) is that there are spiritual vectors to neo-liberalism that touch the soul and not the wallet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this.

Indeed, as you mentioned in the last paragraph, there are some rather important things missing from the documentary. I&#039;ll add to your list that some of his biggest talmidim aren&#039;t featured, including the one who heads the team in charge of publishing his books, and other&#039;s who have large roles in Siach and editing his works. Such absences might say something about a possible competition over owning Rav Shagar&#039;s legacy.Tzur notes in his interview that it wouldn&#039;t be &quot;authentic&quot; to say &quot;THIS is Rav Shagar&quot;. Also missing are Rav Shagar&#039;s two main colleagues from the Makor Chaim kollel and Shefa- Rav Steinsaltz and Rav Fruman. The youngest generation- those who got to Siach in his last years- weren&#039;t so well represented.  

Other than that, I would say that the movie did a very good job of providing interviews with Rav Shagar&#039;s various kinds of students. The ones who&#039;ve remained in Siach, the Datlashim, those who studied with him in HaKotel and Shefa who know teach elsewhere, and even those who may be considered &quot;of the derekh&quot;- Kosman, who always thanks R. Shagar in his books even though he left the mainstream Dati Leumi life, and Ohad Ezrachi, whose brand of new age judaism has led him to call for a sexual openness that got him kicked out of Otniel and other yeshivot [I doubt that many of the rabbis interviewed even knew that he would be in the film, and I would guess that if they had been told then some of them would not have agreed to partake]. 

The generational differences between the different students are also apparent. His earlier ones both look and sound like the more classic &quot;mizrachi&quot; style Dati Leumi types, and as they get younger, the students&#039; appearances and words shift away from that model. I won&#039;t list here who represents which period, but I&#039;ll just point out that Avichai Tzur&#039;s comments &quot;הוא שיחק את זה&quot; and that Rav Shagar wanted to &quot;escape&quot; from this world, is probably not something that his earlire students would have said, even if they were still close with him in those years.

For me, his observation is closely to related to what I view as one of the main points of the film. Rav Shagar is described as almost too difficult to be with for an extended period of time- he sucks some students in, but shuns others (including the movie&#039;s producer), and even those who are part of the &quot;secret circle&quot; he keeps near have a tough time with his tortured soul. Rav Benny calls him &quot;a consuming fire&quot;, and Rav Drayfus claims &quot;that his presence blocked&quot; out others. Vardy paints a picture in which the experiences of the talmidim are results of Rav Shagar&#039;s personal depression and unsatisfaction. His obsessive search for personal authenticity takes a heavy toll on those around him, both students and family. This image is important in understanding Rav Shagar as a larger phenomena, and we should be grateful to Vardy for providing it to us, as it is not something easily expressed in the written form in which we usually learn about Rav Shagar.]]></description>
