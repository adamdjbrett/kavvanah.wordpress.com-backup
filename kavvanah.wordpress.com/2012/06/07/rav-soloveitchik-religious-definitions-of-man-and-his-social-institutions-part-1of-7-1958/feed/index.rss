					<description><![CDATA[&quot;In Halakhic Man, the religious man and the cognitive man were separate. Here we have an assumption that religious man is a version of cognitive man.&quot;

Interesting that in HM &quot;Halakhic Man&quot; is more a version of cognitive man than &quot;religious man.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was listening to Lecture 3.  The Rav spoke about his concern over the way the State of Israel will conduct itself.  He said that for 2000 years, the Jews were a persecuted people who had no way to be tyrants.  Now, with the creation of Israel, how will the Jews conduct themselves?  Will they be no better than the Non-Jewish governments, or will they act in accordance with Judaic ethics?   I thought I heard echoes of Yeshayahu Leibowitz in the Rav&#039;s remarks.    Now that 60 years have passed, do you think Israel has passed the Rav&#039;s test?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Larry, I will post the second lecture next week. I might turn these lectures into an article on the editing process from these lectures to Lonely Man of Faith. 
The question is how do we get the people who quote tertiary versions of the Rav to listen to classic Rav?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I listened to part of Lecture two.  If I did not know when this lecture was delivered, I would have thought it to be a direct attack on today&#039;s Republican party/Tea Party.  The Rav&#039;s rejection of the concept of the individual remaining with his rights even after joining in society would seem to put his interpretation of Judaism at odds with the philosophical foundations of the American Republic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;Intellectual&#039; is a modern (i.e. enlightenment) mistranslation, which renders a false understanding of the entire process here. &#039;Sichli&#039; means spiritual, nefesh hasichlis is the spiritual soul, the one that perceives the spiritual. Man is not just an intellectual being, but a spiritual one, and his task is to regain that spirituality, lost after the chet of odom harishon (More Nevuchim 1 1,2). 
The church, in its bid to assert itself over the existing religions, asserted that Jesus had no hypostasis, no  nefesh, so that he is (sic) divine in the flesh. This is the real meaning of the trinity, 1.the greater divine, 2.the divine presence, and the 3.divine inside the body. There is no fourth part, the soul, that would mark him as a man.]]></description>
