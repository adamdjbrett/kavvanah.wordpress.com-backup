					<description><![CDATA[This caught my eye, because as it happens, I just came back from meeting members of the Lutheran European Commission on Church and Judaism. No, Israel was not on the agenda, but the limits or terms of interfaith dialogue was very much part of our discussions.

In such settings, I often mention R&#039; Soloveitchik&#039;s Confrontation, and many Christian theologians are familiar with it. However, my interlocutor yesterday was unfamiliar with it, which did not prevent me from using it to raise some issues regarding how Jews should react to the Bavarian Evangelical Church&#039;s recent revision of their bylaws regarding their understanding of Jews and Judaism. The danger of expecting tit for tat was very much in the air (acknowledged by them in the first place), and the Jewish position of viewing this as an internal Evangelical issue (also my position) was found very pleasing by them. This is doubtlessly the direct result of the German Lutheran church&#039;s particular history during the Nazi period and their desire for rectifying that historic wrong after the war, continuing to this day.]]></description>
