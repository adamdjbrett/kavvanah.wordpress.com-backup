					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Rav Shalom Hedayya offered to instruct him, he declined.  (site editor- It was R. GershonVilner)&quot;

How do we know it was Gershon Vilner?  As I recall reading it, GS approached the head of an unnamed sephardic yeshiva (there were only 2 at the time) and it was most probably Beit El, which at the time was headed by Shalom Hedayya.  As the story goes, GS wanted to study with him but could not accept the condition Hedayya imposed of refraining from asking any questions for six months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Abulafian techniques were meant to be able to connect with Hashem and have visions/interactions...as you know, it requires &quot;pronouncing&quot; names out loud. 
Marhu, on sefer hapeulot brings many hashbaot to be performed. On Shorshei hashemot we find many of them also. 
And let us not forget hashbaot shedim that we can see on books like brit menucha, tzifuni (not the one in print) and other less known works. 
Although scarse and expensive, we can find these stuff from some not so old morrocon or teiman rabbis about the subject.  
If I may, I would like to ask your opinion on the validity of these techniques. (both abulafian and the hashbaot). R. Hillel condemns them and most roshei yeshivot either condemns it bluntly or are afraid/never experienced it.
Im very intrigued as R. Hillel and most of the roshei yeshivot either are against or afraid to actively touch on these material.
Still, that was not the case with many of old old rabbis and a few of the recent ones…]]></description>

Shaar HaShemot, Specifically page 99.  You would have to be pretty well read in both Abulafia and the Ari to really pick it up.  It isn&#039;t the only place but it is the easiest to point out, and most readily noticeable.   Some of the language there is cribbed straight from Get HaShemot.
Likewise in Shaar HaKavvanot, in the Kavvanot of Nesiat Kepaim, he copies almost verbatim the language of the Otzar HaGanuz.]]></description>
