					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know the man and have nothing to say about him. However, a kibbutz, whether dati or not, is still a failed communist society. I visited two of them, Tirat Tzvi and Shluchot (near Bet She&#039;an) a long time ago. Visit isn&#039;t the right word. Conscripted into forced labor was more like it. For some unknown reason, my dati agricultural high school classmates and I were forced to work for food and shelter at the above kibbutzim. Shluchot with its stinking farmed fish. Tirat Tzvi with its turkeys. Not a fan of kibbutzim.]]></description>
