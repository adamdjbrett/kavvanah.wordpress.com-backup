					<description><![CDATA[Dear Michael,
Rav Nachman was Fine with Kavvanot.In a quotation I can&#039;t find right now he writes that he was on a level that his Kavvanot were always changing because of his progress.So I believe that he used them.The question in likutey tanina 120 is about everyone using them let alone someone who doesn&#039;t understand them.In this source Rav Nachman opposes these options.]]></description>

Nice interview.

I would like to know how do you view the usage of the Abulafian techniques and the hashbaos malachim and shedim. Have you done it ?
Rebbi Chaim brings it...so it seems to have an ok from him. Why it is not taught/practiced in the yeshivot and most of the kabbalistic roshei yeshivot frown upon it?]]></description>

Shaya,
Really please calm down.    I understood going into this that the questions were &quot;devil&#039;s advocate&quot; in order to answer those who may have those questions.  That is the job of a good interviewer.
As far as what you claim Rebbe Nachman opposed, I suggest you discuss it with Rav Elazar Mordechai Koenig, who is a rather important Breslov Rav, a student of Rav M. Sharabi and a Mekaven.  Or with Rav Morgenshtern.  Or with any of the various Braslaver Chassidim that learn in the various Kabbalistic Yeshivot.  They all seem to think the Rebbe Nachman was fine with using kavvanot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps you would consider an interview with Rav Yehudah Alfasi, (my husband) founder and Rosh Yeshivah of Yeshivat haMekubalim Kol Yehudah v&#039;Eliyahu (Tzfat, and now in Tiberias) who specializes in teaching the kavanot of Rabbeinu Rashash and the Arizal?

shaya, 
calm down. I dont question them. I advocate them, that is why I asked him about the kavvanot in Kaplan for ordinary people. But many in my small corner of the Centrist Orthodox world make a sharp distinction between prayer as they do it and prayer as others do it. They also distinguish between the halakhah as objective and  kabbalah which they see as made up. It was to &quot;know what to answer the doubter.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear rabbi brill,
I was quite shocked by some of your questions.Kavvanot when all is said and done are intentions in prayer just like yours.Do you believe prayer is imaginary anti scientific superstition?why are his intentions imaginary and yours somehow real?If drawing down divine bounty and connecting up to g-d is superstition and magic what do you actually believe you are doing when you do mitzvot?Is it some social convention like eating with a fork and knife?If there is no metaphysical consequence what is it worth?
May it be pointed out that Rav nachman fiercely apposed using Kavvanot if you are not on a high spiritual level on which you are aware that you are able to use them.He likened such a dilitant to a sorcerer who not only doesn&#039;t bring down more spiritual influx but actually destroys the spiritual process.]]></description>
