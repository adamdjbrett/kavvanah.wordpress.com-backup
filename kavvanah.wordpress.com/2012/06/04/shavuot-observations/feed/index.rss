By our time all the origin stories for the minhag had to do with not being able to find a competent shochet in the days before Moshe returned down the mountain with the text of Masechet Hullin.

This halachic flexibility of a summer barbecue is in contrast to cheese cake being the sole menu item at the non-ortho tikkun I attended, and the question about cheese cake from my food-centric, non-frum colleague.]]></description>
