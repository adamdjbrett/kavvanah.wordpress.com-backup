					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in Jerusalem, but I think my IP address reads as if it is in Tel Aviv or Ramat Gan (for example, weather websites that read such information assume that I want to know the weather in Tel Aviv or Ramat Gan).  This might be because these cities are where the internet providers of Israel lodge.  After all, when you consider distance relative to America, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv/Ramat Gan are not too much farther than suburbs of one another.  I would guess that many of those listed in your statistics as Tel Aviv are actually residents of Jerusalem and its daughters.]]></description>

I took NY, Brooklyn, Riverdale, Teaneck, and White Plains, for granted.

Thanks for the app list. How about apps for libraries, scholarship, or seforim? Maybe a HebrewBooks app? ]]></description>
