At this point, I will curtail further discussions about 17-19th century issues. The discussions of God, prophecy, and miracles as well as discussions of Voltaire, Hume, Hobbs, Spinoza, Renan, and Strauss are all fine but have nothing to do with the topic at hand and can be discussed even if one has not opened a book written in the last 150 years or read the blog post. Refutations of prophecy and miracles as well as defenses filled shelves before our great-great grandparents were born. They are worth discussing and if you want I can post about the classics of the Enlightenment. 
How recent academic scholars of the biblical text use the texts edited in the 20th century to date Biblical texts is the actual topic of discussion. Please use this chance to read a book or two. Find out about the recent edited Ugaritic, Egyptian and Akkadian texts. You can catch yourself up to date by reading the comprehensives summaries. And please try to read and understand his answers about his own work before typing. This is a rare golden opportunity to find out about the last few decades from an expert historian. Professor Berman is seizing this opportunity.Please discuss Carr&#039;s work.
Yes, historical method and Divine assumptions go right past each other- Rabbi Isaac Breuer discussed this almost 80 years ago about 19th century Biblical criticism. So if one thinks that the Holocaust was a Divine punishment because of the Zionists or anti-Zionists, then know that Divine causality rightfully has no place in historical causality based on political, social, contextual, or economic causes. ]]></description>

Moshe wrote: &quot;I think we need to go back to Spinoza and confront his fundamental arguments against Mosaic authorship.&quot;

I would point out that &quot;Mosaic authorship&quot; is not the traditional Jewish position. Judaism teaches that the Torah is a product of Divine authorship - a very different thing. To my knowledge, all of Spinoza&#039;s arguments are against Mosaic authorship. He does not argue against the position that God authored the Torah, as his theological/philosophical position does not allow for such a possibility in the first place.

The basic premise of all of Spinoza&#039;s arguments, with one minor exception, is that certain statements in the Torah would be anachronistic or inappropriate if Moses, the human being, were the author. These arguments have no bearing on the question of Divine authorship. 

This brings us back to the basic point I have been making. Academic Biblical scholarship rejects the possibility of Divine authorship from the outset. This assumption is axiomatic to the entire field. All discussion and debate begins only after this assumption is made.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On a certain level the point about Orthodox Jews and Bible Scholars coming from different perspectives is important. However the reality is that many of us do share, to a lesser or greater degree, some of the perspective of the bible critics. 

However, given that Orthodox Jews are engaging academic Bible criticism, I think that this focus on the nitty gritty of identifying and dating different authors is something of a distraction from a theological pespective.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to tackle Alan Brill&#039;s last question, slightly rephrased, in a more nuanced way: &quot;If a religious scholar said that his scholarship was informed by the Jewish dating of Moses, and that he took that to be the 13th century BCE  what advice would you give?&quot;

My advice would be &quot;Go for it.  A scholar&#039;s identity and passions can, indeed, sometimes be an albatross, and an impediment to good, balanced ssholarship.  You will need to be judiscious in your work, and will need to affirm the clear data that do not accord with your agenda.  And you mustn&#039;t overstate the findings that do accord with your agenda.

But your identity and your passions can also be a scholarly asset.  You will likely be driven to search avenues and develop approaches that are out of the box, that defy the consensus and that break new ground.  And if you can present your findings to the wider scholarly community, which may not share your agenda, and those findigns are affirmed, you will have performed scholarhsip good service, precisely from allowing your agenda to drive your scholarship.&quot;

I say this from my own experience.  Last March, I published an article in the Journal of Biblical Literature in which I challenged forty years of consensus about the provenance of the aspostasy laws of Deut 13. The conventional wisdom had maintained that those laws were predicated on the Neo-Assyrian Succesion Treaty of Esarhaddon, of the 7th century.  In that study I demonstrated that those laws bear a much greater affinity to a 15th c. Hittite document (CTH 133).  I have been asked many times since the article appeared, how it was that I stumbled across a document that had been on the books for so long (published in 1970), when no one else had. And my answer is that my scholarship is infomed by my tradition, and thus, perhaps, I looked deeper and farther than others had before me.  I suspect that if my identity were not informed by my religious tradition, I would not have asked those questions, and would not have done that digging.  I hope that I did all this in the judiscsious fashion I outlined above.  I certainly did affirm that therewere still two verses in that chapter that seem closer to the Neo-Assyrian text than to the MB Hittite one.  And, in line with David Carr&#039;s call, I made no claims about a sure dating for the text, and argued instead for &quot;methodlogical modesty.&quot;   I know that, to date, no scholars have rejected or rebutted these findings, and that many see my study as a contribution to the field.
So for those operating with identity propelled scholarship - gender based, disability based, religiously based, atheistically based - I say, &quot;Go for it.  You just might make a major contribution.  But do your work judisciously!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/interview-with-david-m-carr-current-state-of-bible-scholarship/#comment-3995&quot;&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m not sure how your assertion to the contrary responds to my point. Academic Biblical scholarship has never been a serious attempt to disprove the traditional Jewish history of the Bible for the simple reason that it has never attempted to deal with that position on its own terms.

Academic Biblical scholarship has never seriously attempted to prove that God could not have written the Torah, or that God could not have revealed future events to His prophets, or that God could not have performed the miracles described in the Torah, or that the similarities between the Torah and various ancient texts (e.g. Epic of Gilgamesh and the Code of Hammurabi) may be the result of a common history and spiritual heritage shared by all mankind.

Rather academic Biblical scholarship simply assumes that these things are not possible and starts from there.

As for your question, &quot;who says that the traditional Jewish position is correct?&quot;, I&#039;m not sure what relevance that has to my point. My question is what relevance can modern Biblical scholarship have to someone who doesn&#039;t accept the assumptions of the field. I suspect that it can have none. Modern Biblical scholarship does not attack the traditional Jewish perspective, it simply ignores it.]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how your assertion to the contrary responds to my point. Academic Biblical scholarship has never been a serious attempt to disprove the traditional Jewish history of the Bible for the simple reason that it has never attempted to deal with that position on its own terms.</p>
