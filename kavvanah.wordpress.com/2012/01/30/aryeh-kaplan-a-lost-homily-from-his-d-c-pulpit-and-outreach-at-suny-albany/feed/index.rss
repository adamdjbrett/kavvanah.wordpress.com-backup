					<description><![CDATA[Aryeh was a friend of mind. I worked with him on the area of missionaries and cults and later meditation. I remember being with him as many of his books were published. I stood beside him when he translated Me&#039;am Loez.  I remember reading early versions of Derach Hashem. I remember the shift to meditation in his later years. 
I&#039;ll share one thing Aryeh told me. &quot;You are spending so much of your time on missionaries and cults. You need to study Eastern religions because there are far more Jews there than anywhere else.&quot;
I can&#039;t share all the stories but he had a great sense of humor and a brilliant way of seeing things outside the box.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought I&#039;d add a few more tidbits from my notes, four years later:
12. He got a plaque from President Johnson
13. When he was 21, his rosh yeshiva compelled him to learn 18 blatt of gemara together from 4:45-6:45 AM. (The compulsion was necessary, because Kaplan tended to skip seder.)
14. The Rebbe (Lubavitcher, IIRC) wanted someone to write a book on Jewish Meditation. First, Rabbi Kaplan had to learn avodah zarah.
15. He answered &quot;the impossible math question.&quot; -- I have no idea what Rabbi Fleer was referring to, sorry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found some notes I took about ten years ago when R&#039; Gedalya Fleer spoke about R&#039; Kaplan at our shul. 
1. the story about the stolen cake. (but no way would he say a bracha over stolen cake, so....)
2. He would feed kids Jewish questions to &quot;show up&quot; the camp counselors
3. a car bumped into his jalopy, and he got $200.
4. he wore a toupee at one time
5. he learned programming in two days
6. he was Oppenheimer&#039;s secretary for two years
7. had beatnik friends in Greenwich Village
8. had a 198 IQ
9. he won 2nd place in a competition for his translation of R&#039; Nachman. On that basis, Moznaim got him to learn Ladino. It took three months.
10. He would pick up a new hobby a year. Three were photography, cactus growing, and art.
11. was once threatened by a rabbi to stop publishing
(If any of these are a bit off, I&#039;m totally open to correction.)]]></description>

@Len Moskowitz: &lt;i&gt;When you look into this, beware of Buddhist and Advaita concepts being presented with a thin veneer of Judaism.&lt;/i&gt;

Yes, I&#039;m aware. I no longer &quot;look into&quot; it. Frankly, I no longer care.

And if I were still interested and had a preference, it would actually be for Advaita.

And by the way, Len - we had a brief exchange on Amazon about four years ago: http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTI2PQ6RDEW3 (I&#039;ve changed my pseudonym since then, but you can see which is me.) I didn&#039;t pursue it at the time, but I&#039;d like to take this opportunity to say that I still disagree with you, and as far as this is concerned:

&lt;i&gt;I think that your expectation that no one from the Yeshivish or Chassidic worlds would agree to be consulted by the Dalai Lama is incorrect. The Orthodox Torah scholars that I know, though having no compelling reason to visit Dharamsala, would gladly welcome the Dalai Lama&#039;s approach for consultation. While there are closed-minded people and extremists in every community (Jewish Renewal included), anyone who took the time to research the Dalai Lama&#039;s life and perspectives on Dharma would likely find him to be among chassiday umot ha-olam (a very pious non-Jew), and so they likely would have little reason to consider him to be an idolater.&lt;/i&gt;

I disagree &lt;i&gt;profoundly&lt;/i&gt;. In fact, I am absolutely convinced that you are wrong. I thought it was an odd complaint on your part at the time, and I still think so.]]></description>

&#062; I don’t know that Judaism has nothing like samadhi, if we define it as a state of non-dualistic awareness.

There&#039;s hitpashtoot ha-gashmeeyoot, bitul, ein ode milvado, and m&#039;tzeedoe/m&#039;tzeedeinoo.  At one point Moshe Rabbeinu speaks God&#039;s words in first person.  All of these are what might be called states of non-dualistic awareness.

By the time they come to me they have already been practicing zazen, vipassana, or Tibetan meditations for years. They already have their inarticulate synthesis between modern orthodoxy and their practice. There are young Orthodox rabbis who have spent years in the monastery or going to retreats. When they come to me the are looking how to integrate that into their lives as Orthodox rabbis. Rabbi David Hayyim Halevi, former chief rabbi of TA, has a famous responsa written 30 years ago permitting the techniques without the ritual devotions. However,most of them have creatively steered their own courses of selective use, rationalizations, and saying that they are only using a technique. And for the last 15 years, the modern Orthodox adepts have also had their practice and thinking mediated through the many ways ways renewal teachers create Jewish versions or uses pieces of Hasidut to create equivocations. Kaplan&#039;s writings have an immense totemistic function of saying - &quot;We have this too, so it is OK to do what you are doing, even if the Establishment is oblivious.&quot; Alternately, people use Kaplan for &quot;even though I leaned my meditation from the Buddhists, my meditation is entirely different because I do it for prophecy and not like the Buddhists who do it without God.&quot; In the end, they have to earn a living and be a rabbi so they focus on synagogue skills and halakhah, or they focus on their ability to teach 10th grade navi. 

Since you were a house manager for years, did it rub off on you. Did you find tranquility and peace? Do you still go for retreats? What tradition did you learn? Do you seek the well being of all sentient beings?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are correct, there is little to compare to Samadhi in Judaism.  

The issue, however, was one of knowledge. Most of those attracted to Kaplan were interested in the counter-cultural bricolage where Kabbalah, I-Ching, Buddhism, Hinduism, and the Whole Earth Catalog were the same. I was in correspondence the other day with one of his students from the 1970’s and she said that she was surprised and upset to learn in his classes that Kabbalah was not the same as pop-Hinduism. She assumed that everything counter-cultural was in agreement. People at the Hillel in Albany and in Brooklyn were looking for an alternative to the straight establishment, not to sit in retreat and master Samadhi techniques. Nor did they want to practice kavvanot and yihudim everyday. They just wanted a cultural demarcation of mysticism and eastern ideas to infuse in their lives, a little breslov, a little chabad, and some Buber.

About the myth that there were lots of Jewish spiritual masters before WWIII and that Judaism had linages of mediation pre-WWII, I am not sure who started that myth. I think it comes out of Renewal circles.

On the science part, I do think he would have written more. But his views were closer to science fiction and Analog magazine than science or intelligent design, unfolding of deeper secrets. He would probably have loved string theory.]]></description>
