					<description><![CDATA[Ari
thanks.
A google search located that he taught elementary school at the  Eliahu Academy in Louisville, it was the liberal community school, so he could assume his students would come by car on Shabbat. There was also the Orthodox day school called Talmud Torah. 
He is Rav Aharon on that teshuvah

					<description><![CDATA[R. Aryeh Kaplan&#039;s position on the age of the earth is well known and often cited. Indeed, he has already been attacked for it by Dovid Kornreich, R. Moshe Meiselman&#039;s acolyte..

“Amid the Alien Corn” is a neat reference to the figure of Ruth in “Keat’s Ode to a Nightingale.”
…the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,/ she stood in tears, amid the alien corn;”
The irony is that Keats represents Ruth in the land of Israel yearning for Moab, while R. Kaplan in Iowa was presumably yearning for Jerusalem.

					<description><![CDATA[In &#039;Immortality, Resurrection, and the Age of the Universe, RAK has several positions that would not fit into today&#039;s Daas Torah box, from reconciling the 15 billions years of the universe w/ Torah dating (Ch. 1, The Age of the Universe), to the women&#039;s movement being a tikun for the klalla of Chava &#039;vehu imshol bach&#039; (Ch. 5 Male and Female), the existence of pre-Adam man (Ch. 2, Longevity and Immortality in Judaic Sources).  I do not think we need wonder, he clearly did not allow his creative thinking to be limited.  I feel reluctant to even post this for fear that his books may be pulled from certain Yeshiva libraries or bookstores if they are not already.The articles published in the book were done so posthumously,  one wonders whether RAK purposefully kept them in manuscript form. As an aside, I assume Pearle Besserman is the same Pearle Epstein who published a book called Kabbalah which presents Kabbalah through biographies of the great Kabblists.  She talks about having learnt with RAK inthe intro.]]></description>
