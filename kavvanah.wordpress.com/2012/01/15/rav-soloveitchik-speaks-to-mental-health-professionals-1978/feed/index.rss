					<description><![CDATA[Ari, Greeting and nice to hear from you. I thought about the shout out, but then you would not have visited.
To respond to you and Yossi together.
Yes,  the adultery discovered in marriage therapy is discussed on the tape. But more sordid details are given in Paul Kahn, Psychotherapy and the commandment to reprove. &quot;Behavioral sciences and mental health&quot; Proceedings (Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists) 7 (1983) 37-50.
and more of the issues on the tape are discussed in Paul Kahn, Religious values and the therapeutic alliance, or &quot;Help me, psychologist; I hate you, rabbi!&quot;. Psychotherapy of the Religious Patient (1985).
Not all of the other articles in the volumes would be acceptable or legal therapeutic practice after 30 years.
And for full historical background, I read the articles in Ari&#039;s apartment in Romema.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is this the shiur where the Rav speaks about a case where a certain Rosh Yeshivah referred a couple to a therapist for marriage therapy,  and then it emerged that each one had been unfaithful to the other?  I think the question had to do with the conflicting priorities of the a therapist who is supposed to do what he can to keep the couple together as opposed to the halacha which would mandate a divorce because the wife was unfaithful.]]></description>
