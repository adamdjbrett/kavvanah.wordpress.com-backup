					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how Rabbi Blau relates or compares his opinion to the rest of YU, who are way to the right, especialy those Roshei Yeshiva who think we are fighting a messianic war, that all Palestinians are Biblical enemies, and that one can shoot those who think of peace?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In regards to Rabbi Blau&#039;s words at the end of his talk, I struggle with the Midrash he quoted in relationship to the lesson of Az Yashir itself.  While G-d chastises the Angels, we do not hear G-d chastising the Israelites who were singing in praise of G-d bringing down the mighty Egyptians.  In my eyes, while it is indeed valuable to see the &quot;other&#039;s&quot; humanity, I am hard-pressed to see the moral lesson being brought forth through this Midrash, which I should add I have used in sermons as well.  

The Midrash does indeed give pause to think that we should view all people as G-d&#039;s creations, yet in its relationship to Az Yashir, I find a contradictory  lesson, namely that as humans we can praise our survival but as those striving to be in relationship with the Divine, we need to transcend the moment of survival.  Nevertheless, from a practical standpoint, I think Az Yashir mainly refers our survival in Parashat Beshalach as Shabbat Shirah, the extensive use of kriat Yam Suf in the liturgy and the commemorating of the miracles at the Yam Suf on the 7th day of Passover, for it was a grand moment which provides us with hope for the future.  

Having said all that, I do think the midrash, qua midrash, is in line with teaching us how we need to stretch our boundaries when relating to those elements of humanity we feel animosity towards, and as such I do find R. Blau&#039;s words to be a strong statement in relationship building.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shalom Rav Blau,

Thank you for all of your great and inspiring work!
How can Orthodoxy increase sensitivity, dignity, and embracing the other today? What are the best strategies to ensure Modern Orthodoxy&#039;s Torah discourse and religious commitments once again become rooted in the ethical?
