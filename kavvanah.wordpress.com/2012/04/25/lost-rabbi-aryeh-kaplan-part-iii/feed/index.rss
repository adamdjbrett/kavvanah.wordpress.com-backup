Recently my article mentioning Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan&#039;s innovative approach to meditation was published. If you write to me, I can send a PDF: Natan Ophir, “The Lubavitcher Rebbe’s Call for a Scientific Non-Hasidic Meditation,” B&#039;or Ha&#039;torah, vol. 22, 2013, 109-123.

ABSTRACT
In February 1978 Rabbi Menahem Mendel Schneerson (the Lubavitcher Rebbe) sent out a confidential memorandum asking for “doctors specializing in neurology and psychiatry” to develop a meditation program that could serve as an alternative for the popular meditative imports from the Far East such as Transcendental Meditation (TM). Dr. Yehuda Landes, a psychologist in Palo Alto, California, responded positively and soon launched a pilot project. Then in July 1979, the Rebbe issued a public announcement asking for more people to help in developing and disseminating a Jewishly acceptable form of meditation. 

Meanwhile, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, together with a group of Jewish psychiatrists and psychologists, was exploring meditative techniques from kabbalistic and hasidic sources. However, the Rebbe directed Landes not to utilize Kaplan’s meditations but rather to develop a non-hasidic scientifically based meditation. 

In this article we examine the context of the Rebbe&#039;s correspondence and analyze his request by comparing it to the scientific meditative techniques being developed in the 1970&#039;s. We conclude by noting the implications for modern Jewish meditation.]]></description>

Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan
(1934 - 1983)

Rabbi Kaplan was a prime force behind the teshuvah phenomenon – the return to Jewish observance. “Throughout history, Jews have always been observant,” he once remarked. “The teshuvah movement is just a normalization. The Jewish people are sort of getting their act together. We’re just doing what we’re supposed to do.”

In culling Jewish sources for his books, he once remarked, “I use my physics background to analyze and systematize data, very much as a physicist would deal with physical reality.” This ability enabled him to undertake monumental projects, producing close to 50 books, celebrated for their erudition, completeness and clarity.

His personal example of modesty, midos tovos, great human warmth and sensitivity, and total dedication to Torah study and life of mitzvos, was an inspiration to the thousands of individuals whom he touched. His home was always open to visitors, great and humble, from every segment of the Jewish community. His Shabbos table was always crowded with guests attracted to the beauty of the Torah life that he lived, and to the endless stream of wisdom and Torah insight which flowed from his lips.

He labored tirelessly, day and night, producing more outstanding works of great and original Torah scholarship single-handedly than teams of other authors working in the field. Yet, he somehow managed to find time for the simplest Jew, perfect strangers, seeking the answers to the spiritual questions in their lives. None were turned away empty-hand..

P.S. I am a son of rabbi aryeah kaplan and i want to inform the public we are writing a new torah in his memory in honer of his 30 th  yahrzeit . if anyone is intrested you can email at Rabbiaryeahkaplan@yahoo.com or call me at 646-296-4323 
thank you

I am right now working on a comparison between Rav Moshe Sternbuch and Rav Moshe Feinstein. Rav Dovid Zvi Hoffman -and the Sridie Aish are in the background.

Gedalya Fleer claimed that he “skipped” his BA and placed into MA classes -”yeshiva credits” from Israel?
However I have found Fleer’s comments mixed, some have been helpful and filled gaps, while others I can disprove.
Incidentally, based on the other rabbinic positions he takes – notably Iowa – which Alan stated only had “late” Friday night services, it would seem that he did not accept Rav Moshe’s psak.]]></description>
