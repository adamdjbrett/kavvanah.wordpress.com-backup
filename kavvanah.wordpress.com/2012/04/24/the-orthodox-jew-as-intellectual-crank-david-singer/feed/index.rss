					<description><![CDATA[I have doubts that Singer presents a complete balanced description of the Kuzweil-Scholem exchanges. Based on readings many years ago and totally subject to the distortions of my memory and imagination , there were two inter-related fights, one as described, and a second where Scholem let loose on the Breuer kehila with the full force of his sarcasm and rhetorical power. Here Kurzweil responded and defended Breuer, but in a sweet and measured way. He spoke about the beauty of the service , the reassuring quality of the old minhagim, the nigunim of Askenazic Jewry that were preserved by the kehila, and so on in this vein. Why was Scholem so contemptuous of Frankfort? I am a little unclear but I’ll give it a try. He raged at the denial of the reality, how even as the dream of  German-Jewish Orthodoxy was going up in flames they refused to admit any errors, nor acknowledge any of the Zionist achievements or predictions. Issac Breuer in fact doubled up on the fantasy, now dreaming of a Hirschian type Orthodox theocracy in Palestine. They were guilty of all the sins involved in what is now called the German-Jewish symbiosis, the one sided love affair between Jews and Germans. I believed the Frankfort austritt Orthodox were patriotic during WW1 and fought honorably in the German army, while Scholem though the war was idiotic and evaded the draft. Their identification with the Germany of Goethe and Schiller was already outdated when the kehila was founded, and in any event was always superficial. Their a- historicism was theological double talk, and unlike their nemesis the  Hildersheimer academy in Berlin, was totally unscientific. They were petit bourgeois narrow people lacking in imagination. 
And that was for starters.LOL. Against such a background, Kurzweil was the sane traditionalist and Scholem a bit of a crank.]]></description>

To answer the second, No the Rav would not apply at all. The model is more of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/tzvia-greenfield-and-judith-butler/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tzvia Greenfield- Haredi and Meretz.&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading Singer&#039;s piece in its entirety, I was left with 2 questions:

1.  Who in today&#039;s pantheon of Orthodox intellectuals qualifies?  [fow which you indicate you have some potential nominees]; and, 
2.  With hindsight, who else in the late 20th century pantheon would we now discuss in these terms beyond Kurzweil and Leibowitz?  Could anyone make a reasonable case the Rav, for example, fits Singer&#039;s typology in this article?]]></description>
