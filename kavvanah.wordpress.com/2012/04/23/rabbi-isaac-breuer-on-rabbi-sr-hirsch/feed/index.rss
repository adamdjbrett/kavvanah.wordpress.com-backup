					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been a while since I read the essay, but my impression always was that it was directed  mainly against Scholem&#039;s  recent very harsh and rather nasty  review of Breuer&#039;s Neue Kusari. I  believe that there is one pretty clear allusion in the essay to the review. That is, &quot;Say whatever you want about my book, but don&#039;t rmess with my great and sainted grandfther!&quot;]]></description>
