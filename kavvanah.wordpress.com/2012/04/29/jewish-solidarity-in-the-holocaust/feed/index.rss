					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Alan - for years I&#039;ve thought Todorov&#039;s book deserves a wider audience, and in particular his distinction between heroic and ordinary virtue, the former taking shape in terms of grand Ideas (Art, Religion, Scholarship, Nation), and the former, fundamental care for the well-being of the people around us. 
I think that the heroic virtue has its place (even to call it &#039;heroic&#039; is to deflate it a little), as part of how society talks about its own collective values, and perhaps on an individual level in some extreme situations. But ordinary virtue is a far more certain moral compass in our lives, and regularly harder to achieve.]]></description>
