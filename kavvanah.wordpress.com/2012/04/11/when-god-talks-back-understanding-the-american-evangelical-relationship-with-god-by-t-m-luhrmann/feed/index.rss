See some of the discussion in my posts on Zvi Mark. The goal is to overcome reason and enter into the world of song, dialogue, prayer, madness..
Garb presents the goal as mysticism- absorption and annihilation.

What everyone is 21st century Uman gets from it probably varies. I would suspect that Americans, pace Luhrmann, get answers]]></description>

I would ask:   

Is not Jewish teaching (CHareidi Orthodox) self/nation centered?  Everything is about us.  We don&#039;t give a damn about the outside world And even within the community, we seem to approach God as our personal butler/doctor/accountant, etc..   God seems, for most orthodox jews, to exist only to serve us, not the other way around.  Is this not a problem?
Are we not very self-centered in our relationship with God? We treat God as if he were here to serve us and not the other way around.]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;Indeed, but is this broadly understood and accepted as an issue? &lt;/em&gt;

What is your question?]]></description>

Are their analogues in Jewish religious segments?]]></description>
