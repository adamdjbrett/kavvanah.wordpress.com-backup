					<description><![CDATA[You write in this review that &quot;We are left guessing if he constructed a leniency based on Rabbenu Tam (which is what he did as RCA member) or he jettisons halakhah before his ethical voice&quot;. Are you saying that the marriage was given an OK and registered by the RCA who had knowledge of the circumstances. If so, then the book is very misleading and unfair to Rabbi Hartman. Thanks David]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fwiw, a few months ago my wife attended an 80th birthday gathering for Hartman at the Machon. When it was his turn to speak, she said, he got up and told everyone that his life&#039;s work had been a failure, and that he had in particular failed to deal with the single most central problem of our time, i.e. belief in God after the Holocaust. 
I know that this last talk of his, on the face of it, comes from a different planet than the one on which the book under  review here was written.]]></description>
