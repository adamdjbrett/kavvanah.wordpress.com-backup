					<description><![CDATA[A refelection on Dayyan Grunfeld in London (I should point out that I only met  him two or three times):   Dayan Grunfeld lived on Green Lanes (if I remember correctly!), on the fringes of Finsbury Park/Stamford Hill.  There were two &#039;German&#039; communities - one, &#039;Munk&#039;s&#039;, was in Golders Green, on the other side of North London.  It was completely dominated by Rav Munk, and was completely &#039;Frankfurtian&#039;, which I am not sure Dayan Grunfeld was (I may be wrong).  The other, the &#039;Adass&#039; in Stamford Hill, was headed by the late Dayan J. H. Dunner (d.2007), who was, I think, a Viennese &#039;Schiff-Shul&#039; scion; and in any case the Adass was much more Eastern European.  So he had no real community in England.  In the Beth Din, he was respected, but that was also Litvish/Yeshivish in orientation.  Interestingly, I don&#039;t think he ever had a position at Jews&#039; College, or was involved in Gateshead.  All of this probably speaks to his personal choice, and to his dignity and integrity.  As an anecdote, I recall being shown (by now Dayyan-then Rabbi Binstock???) a copy of correspondence betwee him and William Rees-Mogg.  WRM had written a book on monetary theory, the Gold Standard and inflation.  The Dayyan had reviewed it in an obsecure synagogue periodical, and sent a copy to WRM -- who responded that in highlighting the morally corrosive effect of inflation, he had been the only reviewer who really understood the point of the book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not believe there is any lengthy bio of Isidore Grunfeld, other than an article in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (DNB), to which I do not have current access.  There does not (even!) seem to be a Wikipedia entry, although many - dare I say it - lesser UK rabbinic luminaries and Dayanim merit articles.  Dayan Grunfeld&#039;s daughter lives (lived ?) in Brooklyn.  He was indeed a profound thinker, and had a small circle of &#039;chasidim&#039; in London.  In the fashion of Anglo-Jewry, he was unappreciated.  Dayyan Ivan Binstock of the London Beth Din knew him very well.]]></description>

Yes. If you have Concepts of Judaism (Feldheim, 74), then read it.
The versions in the Jung volumes have different editors and are also valuable. 
Hirsch&#039;s recent translator Gertrude Hirschler used to sit every day in YU&#039;s library. Many of us were friendly with her. Someone just told me that she considered herself Mizrachi but could not be a card carrying member.
Breuer agreed with Levi&#039;s interpretation. For, Breuer, the declaration was either Satanic or Divine given, he decided on the latter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! Budget contraints force me to ask:  Does R&#039; Isaac Breuer make   similar points in The New Kuzari, Moriyah, Concepts of Judaism,   Israel of Tomorrow (R&#039; Jung, editor), or The Problem of the Jew (R&#039; Elias, editor), which are already on my shelf?  

Over Shabbos, I read Yehuda (Leo) Levi in &quot;The World of Hirscian Teachings&quot;. He speculates that R&#039; Hirsch would have agreed with rabbonim who saw the League of Nations Jewish homeland resolution, or the United Nations vote to recognize Israel, as the permission needed from the nations to return to the Land.]]></description>

Avi
You may want to read Rabbi Isaac Breuer&#039;s classic essay on Hirsch to gain a sense of the post WWI readings. Breuer presents Hirsch as a new historical era when there is a reclaiming of the Jewish national civilization; the old era was shed to make way to prepare ourselves in this new national era for the redemptive era. -translated in Leo Jung, Jewish Leaders. The oaths limit us from redeeming ourselves but not from preparing ourselves. 
On the other hand, most others assume that Mizrachi is not redemptive rather educational and pragmatic.In the same volume, look at the way they present the concern for Israel at the Berlin seminary. ]]></description>
