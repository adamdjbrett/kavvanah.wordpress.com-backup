					<description><![CDATA[The trouble with the Maimonides School model is the implied elitism of it.  Even parents who 100% buy into the pre-eminent importance of the life of the mind sometimes have offspring who clearly are not going to do well at a school like this; let alone that you couldn&#039;t find 10 Orthodox Jewish families prioritizing intellectual achievement in Boca if your life depended on it.

So the Rabbi is not wrong to notice that immersion in pop culture is the real ocean in which his congregation swims, but he has no idea what to recommend as a solution for this problem other than &#039;havdalah&#039; from the environment.  This appeal comes across to most as a call to believe in communal superiority.  Perhaps following Conservative and Reform Jewish models emphasizing greater engagement in the community at large (broader than just the Beach Club and Golf Club, I hope) might be a route out of some of the contradictions the Rabbi finds his congregation in?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[a) The reason empires and corporations fall is because the system they have built is so massive that they are unable to see themselves from outside it and are therefore unable to correct the issues that grow within the organisation.

The purpose of mussar (referenced here is hisbonenus) and of the yamim noraim (particularly kol nidrei and the succah) is to release ourselves of our script / life-story and to examine our progress from outside of it. This is incredibly difficult. However it is the reason that Judaism has survived - naar yisrael ve&#039;ohavo - because we maintain the attitude of a youth who always explores possibilities - we have flourished.

b) There is a tendency to address over-indulgence critically, which isn&#039;t always the answer. &#039;You are losing yourself&#039; is as powerful a message as &#039;Curb your desires&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought he had the beginnings of an interesting drush when he equates hisbonenus to mindfulness,  which then segues easily into taking life slowly.  Now mindfulness is a term that has been introduced in more recent self help literature, and  differs from  the Oprah-The Secret  gospel that if you wish it strongly enough you’ll make it big. Its predecessors are Gurdjieff, Feldenkrais, tai chi exercises, breathing –yoga techniques, and more recent ideas about stress reduction, flow, (e.g. Kabat-Zinn, Csíkszentmihályi.) But being a rabbi and quoting Der Alter from Kelm, he can’t quite make the transition. He says “Be present and give thought to every morsel of food that enters your body. Be aware of every word you speak, every decision you make, every penny you spend, and every moment that passes.” He ends up offering a sort of goulash of hisbonenus as zehirus, super ego scrutiny of every detail in one’s life, and the more modern idea of watchfulness with minimal self reproach.

His ideas  about slowing down are also somewhat ambiguous. The most straightforward reading of taking life slowly is a Mediterranean life style, slow cooking,  long leisurely lunches in the piazza, good wine, people watching, a little siesta, late dinners and an active night life. In Boca where there is human limit how many times one can stroll around Mizener Park, the solution for taking life at a slower pace naturally involve the country club, the beach, boating, movies. Listening to the rabbi  we have the comic situation of slow but not country club slow, slow but not mixing with the general culture. If he was clever he would have found ways to improve the level of frumkeit taking into account his congregation is in Boca and not Flatbush. Ideally the model should be the Latin American communities, where in addition to a yeshiva and a shul there is luxurious Jewish Center, where adults, teens and children can enjoy an active social life in a Jewish setting. But given that the rabbi has internalized charedi values, all he can do is dish all purpose charedi musar on tzniyus, and scare his congregation with  the horror of nubile teenagers and the mortal dangers of drugs and sex.]]></description>

That was the goal, to not have time in the first place. This is unlike many of the recent day schools. In addition, they would not honor someone for pop-culture contributions who had a low grade point average. Finally, they banned all logos, insignia, or references. It was preemptive. It was never phrased as Jewish particularization vs outside culture. It was seen as low-brow and not leading to education. The &quot;corrosive forces&quot; were identified with Jewish parental attitudes not    our lack of particularization.]]></description>
