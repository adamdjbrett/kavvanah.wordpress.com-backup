					<description><![CDATA[My thanks to AB for his - as always - serious reading.  Yes, there is much of Zeitlin that could not be included here, and I would be the first to welcome a second volume.  Both the series size format and the integrity of a single-themed volume dictated choices made.  I do think the very best of his neo-Hasidic writings are included here, but there is much more that this intellectually vibrant, highly prolific, and ever-controversial writer had to say.

The most attractive thing about Zeitlin to me personally - unstated in the volume - was that he was a deeply religious Jew and yet a social non-conformist.  He was, if you will, a fully &quot;transdenominationalist&quot; Jew in the terms of interwar Poland, equally vilified by hasidim, Zionists, Socialists, assimilationists, and nearly everyone else.  How can a contemporary religious would-be nonconformist not love this guy?

					<description><![CDATA[steve- the originals were articles in the Yiddish press and then collected and translated into Hebrew. Some of them have an early translation in the Yavneh series and then a new translation by Jonathan Meir. 
YM- I was using the term in the US meaning. see here 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Hasidism
[p.s. YM- Can you please pick one name and stick to it? I have you for about 5 different names]
JR- Green claims that there must have been an influence because of simialrities- see his article &quot;Three Warsaw Mystics&quot; in Rivka Shatz Festschrift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With regard to R&#039; Zeitlins relationship towards James, he felt that he was the only significant attempt towards a systematic approach to defining religious behavior. In &quot;al gvul shnei olamos&quot; he writes that it stems from James&#039;s recognition of the ultimate undefinability of religious behavior. I see how this idea is seen in Heschel&#039;s writings, but was Zeitlin a known influence on him?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Unlike the contemporary Neo-Hasid, for Zeitlin the Hasid of the future needs to work on shimrat habrit and sexual holiness.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not so up-to-date on my terminology, but does this mean that it&#039;s wrong to refer to Habakuk/chardal or Steinzaltz types as neo-hasidic?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this, as ever.  Has Green made a translation directly from the Zeitlin text, or is this a translation of a hebrew version?  If so, what is the hebrew version called?  I ask because you mention a translation by Tovia Preschel.

Thanks]]></description>
