					<description><![CDATA[Thirty years ago if you had a talmid chacham it was something respectable. Today if you&#039;re not ying-bop-heying at shalosh se&#039;udos there&#039;s something wrong with you. I blame it on the psychologists making out that if something is not a feel good experience then it&#039;s &#039;not OK&#039;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to not like Schlock-Rock (tm), but it has grown on me.  Also, we came to know the Solomon family, who are really good people. 

NCSY was designed as outreach.  LSS flirted with it in the 1980s, and rejected it as &quot;not aimed at us, we&#039;re already frum&quot;, which was true for most of the shul kids involved in youth groups.  I liked it, though, being a not-yet-frum person in the group.  Also, I met the guy who introduced me to my wife in NCSY.

Ramah camps seem to be a major influence on Conservative Judaism - it raises a cadre of observant, knowledgeable kids beyond what the relatively few Solomon Schechters can produce - the immersion environment of summer camp teaches a lot more than half-days at school, for any environment (in my case, I did most of my advancement work for the year at Scout camp).  By the same token, though, since Conservative is not a comfortable place for most to be observant, the Ramah camps have raised a number of Modern Orthodox Jews.  Conservative synagogues need a next generation of knowledgeable shul leadership, but they are driven away by social factors.

Fun combined with an adolescent renunciation/rebellion - that&#039;s NCSY for you.  How to bring that enthusiasm home with parents who actively oppose your desire to start keeping shabbat &#038; kashrut is left as a challenge for the reader.

But making BTs among the young (without kidnapping, please) is certainly made more effective because of the rebellion aspect, and kids&#039; greater enthusiasm about things.  Pied Piper, anyone?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is clear enough that the practices in MO over the years, beginning with the efforts of Rabbis Jung, Lookstein etc. have  become more stringent and halacha bound.   What remains unclear is whether there is unique  differentiating culture of MO, and whether there is a logic to its development over time. In the case of MO there was a period when the whole point was not to have a particularly distinctive culture. MO Jews were just like everyone else, except they did not abolish mitzvot and halacha as did the Reformers. This was felt to be inadequate since ‘everyone else’ covers a whole lot of ground, from high brow academia to consumers of pop culture and much else. I do not think this problem has ever been solved definitively. Until we have a clear baseline of the golden era of normative MO culture, how can we say MO is becoming juvenilized? What was the distinctive adult version of MO culture? 
If we need a model I would suggest the vacillations in the gay world. In the 70’s the line was gays were like everyone else except for their sexual behavior. In the 90’s it was claimed they were different from everyone else and part of a subversive feminized queer culture, but pretty much like everyone else when it comes to sex  except for object choice. Since gay culture changes quickly and since some of the versions don’t work well with masculine identities, nothing is ever settled. Both groups sense they are different, but not too different. Both have difficulties in explaining to themselves and others what are the distinctive marks of their culture. Charedim have no such problem, they love being outsiders.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess it&#039;s a question of what kind of affect is getting produced. A lot of this rings true of my own growing up in the leftwing milieu of Habonim-Dror, but without all the religious renuncuation. Also, we were much more into drugs. Also, left out by the post are sex and music. I&#039;m not sure how those carry over into the religious summer camp-youth movements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, so we clearly have a juvenile religious culture. However, given that it is a product of a larger trend of extended adolescence it is hard for me to imagine an alternative. One could also point to the requisite extended stay in kollel as a juvenilization of hareidi religious culture. If you go back a century the typical rabbinic biography involved taking a first position in one&#039;s early twenties.]]></description>
