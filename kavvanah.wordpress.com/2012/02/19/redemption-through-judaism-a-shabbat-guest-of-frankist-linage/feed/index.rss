					<description><![CDATA[By framing Frank in terms of subsequent descendants of Polish Frankists there is the inevitable impression that the natural historical development of Frankism is some form of romantic nationalism.  I think that were Frank alive today he would be more than an adventurer or antinomian. He would have moved down the road to total pessimistic nihilism, similar to recent Continental philosophy. The uncertainty about the planet, the horrors of the last century, plus the tenor of the times requires something more radical than pushing against the traditional Jewish community or hustling in the style of Maduff and similar crooks. Frank seems like a guy who was always willing to go one step further than was thought possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan, I know quite a few people from well known Frankist families in Poland. All of them were told by their parents about the FACT that they come from Frankist families. But I have never met anyone in whose family some specifically Frankist tenets or traditions were preserved. In other words, none of them knows anything of Frankism (or of Judaism, for that matter), unless they independently learned about it from academic publications. As for your guest, it is interesting what he says about his mother keeping a separate pot for milk. The late Avraham Duker has some great stuff about descendants of Jewish (not necessarily Frankist) converts in Poland preserving some vestiges of kashrut for dozens or even hundreds of years. Finally, as for the Polish nobility, what you are saying is generally true, but is not linked to Romanticism. Already in the late 16th century you have families of szlachta who trace their genealogies back to King David. You had ennoblements of Jewish converts long before the Frankists and you had Polish noble families acknowledging their link to the Jews.]]></description>

The Brandeis bio that came out 2 years ago spends some time discussing Brandeis&#039;s Frankist yikhes. The Prague Frankists were a horse of a different color, as they remained culturally Jewish, even wealthy and influential members of hte community. Brandeis was a scion of the Wehle family, well-known Frankists.
Maciejko has some good (and free) entries on the subject at the YIVO Encyclopedia site.]]></description>
