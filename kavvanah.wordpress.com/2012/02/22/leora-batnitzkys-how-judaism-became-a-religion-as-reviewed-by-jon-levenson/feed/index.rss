You find my thesis misguided and unconvincing. Ok. Maybe these links on the Paul Ryan phenomenum will help.

					<description><![CDATA[batnitzky also errs in her understanding of solomon maimon. maimon says &quot;I am led to consent entirely to Mendelssohn&#039;s reasoning... The fundamental laws of the Jewish religion are at the same time the fundamental laws of the Jewish state.&quot; batnitzky, p. 120, considers this to be an esoteric criticism of Mendelssohn, who &quot;essentially held the opposite.&quot; however, this is a far-fetched interpretation if you consider Mendelssohn&#039;s assessment of the law in ancient Israel, in which &quot;state and religion were not conjoined but one; not connected but identical.&quot; This is a well-known part of Mendelssohn&#039;s theory, and apparently the one Maimon had in mind.

On the other hand, it’s clear that Maimon is deviating from Mendelssohn view, and seems to be intentionally obtuse in misunderstanding Mendelssohn. I don’t think this qualifies as coded criticism however.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember when Dick Gephardt was running for the Democratic nomination The New Republic was saying Catholics like Gephardt were social democrats at heart, interested in the welfare of working people many of whom were Catholic and Democrats. I would think such a social democratic church would count as both religious and modern. Here we are a decade later with Santorum-Gingrich representing a new powerful revival of Catholic political leadership  with Evangelicals in tow. Their battle against abortion and vice does not come from a social democratic place. It increasingly resembles the pre-war European Catholic right wing political parties, who saw their purpose as defeating Marxism and secular humanism.  In favoring  a Catholic underpinning to all social and political action, this aspect of the Catholic Church thinking has consistently seen modernism as the enemy to be defeated.  In Jewish thinking the Agudah now seems to follow the Catholic activist position on abortion, homosexuality etc. At some point it seems to me it becomes a mistake, an obscurantism of sorts, to talk of non-secular, illiberal approaches to modernity.  (Ayala Fader in her study of Bobover women, “Mitzvah Girls”, takes such a position. She is so persuasive the reader ends up with nonsense like “Satmar but not Bobov is anti-modernity.”)

					<description><![CDATA[I question whether Levenson&#039;s summaries in some cases aren&#039;t guilty of the same quickness that he attributes to Batnitzky&#039;s statements. His explanation that &quot;Conservative Judaism, which has traditionally put great emphasis on history and peoplehood, less on the particularities of observance, and almost none on theology&quot; reflects if anything, troubled feelings about movements that aren&#039;t Orthodox. I doubt that a Conservative rabbi, or a devout Conservative Jew would agree with his statement.

I think it is important to remember that Hirsch&#039;s position, while it may have been a response to the growing Reform movement of his time, advocated &quot;modern&quot; or unconventional Orthodox practices for the 19th century, such as the concept that secular study would have a place, and in fact a role, in the life of the devout Jew. In this context, Batnitzky&#039;s statement that  “Hirsch’s Orthodoxy is…the most modern of modern Judaisms” is totally understandable. I think it would surprise Levenson to discover that Hirsch&#039;s writings are studied by Conservative and - yes - Reform Jews, just as are the earlier writings of Maimonides and Rashi.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re of course both right in their way, but I&#039;m not impressed by Levenson&#039;s critique. Both Hirsch and Soloveitchik were playing the modern game; to judge them only by their continuities with pre-modern Judaisms is to take them too much at face value. Levenson&#039;s categories are the classic ones: Sinai, Zion, etc. so he sees the continuities there. But on the realms of meaning and purpose, both Soloveitchik and Hirsch are definitively modern. That&#039;s what made them do appealing: they defended Orthodoxy on Modernity&#039;s terms.]]></description>
