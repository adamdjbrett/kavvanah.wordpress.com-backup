					<description><![CDATA[Many people clicked to download the Seder,  so I assumed it launched a few [dozen?] others.

I am not sure Deshen would apply to contemporary Orthodoxy for many reasons: our familiarity with the service, our greater passivity when we have been trained to daven and say selichot  leaving only a glorified maariv. I do not see the liminality in our current settings.  And I know the literature that makes Kol Nidrei into an illocution, our educations makes it into a locution.  We think of how much Torah we know about it.  Much of the current Torah on teshuvah makes it into a domesticated locution or perlocution. You may need some anthropological observation in current congregations to see the lack of liminality and their discomfort with performance ritual.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to thank you for your Tu b&#039;Shvat post. I don&#039;t know if it launched a thousand seders, but it was certainly the impetus for us to attend a seder this last week.

It was very moving, and actually seemed to me to fill a role in the Jewish calendar that generally feels empty. Not only is it in this period of time totally empty of Jewish holidays, but thematically it seems like an interesting counterpoint to most of our holidays. Days like Yom Kippur and Rosh haShana are technically speaking these very holy days where we are like angels -- yet the days are spent recounting sins and talking about this mundane world. On Tu b&#039;Shvat, however, the day is technically a very physical, earthy day, and the entire liturgy we read at the dinner table dealt with calculating different worlds (Atzilut, Briah...).

One quick thing I wanted to raise with you from your post. One reason you write that Tu B&#039;svhat isn&#039;t super popular among Jews is, &quot;the seder is a performative ritual. Most modern orthodox Jews have a difficult time with ritual. performance.&quot; It was of particular interest to me since one of the things that I see as important to my academic work is bridging Performance Studies + Jewish Studies, and specifically reading the latter by way of the former. My MA thesis is on the performance of the Kol Nidre service, in light of Deshen&#039;s argument that it&#039;s a liminal service that creates communitas, and in light of J.L. Austin&#039;s writing on illocutionary statements, etc.]]></description>
