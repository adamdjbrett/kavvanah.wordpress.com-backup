Elat Chayyim has changed.  Jeff Roth no longer runs it.  They&#039;re owned by Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center and, in my opinion, seem to have become more of a business than a community.  Their retreats now appeal to a wider Jewish community than just the Renewal crowd.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My post here was on the sociological of post-evangelical and less on the philosophic idea of post-modernity. 

I find Grenz, who died young coming to terms with the 1980&#039;s and early nineties. By 2010, deconstructionists are not seen as howling at the door. People have grown used to post-structural and hermeneutical ideas. But I agree with you, he is most similar to modern Orthodoxy.  I do find too much Alister McGrath looking over his shoulder. 
George Lindbeck also uses Barth.  I used to be more inclined in this direction but there some articles that I have accepted that contrast the post-liberals to Barth. The latter was more apostolic continuity and institution bound and less text bound.  The problem with using Rav Soloveitchik is that he is currently the heroic image for Centrist Orthodoxy which does not appreciate the theological elements in his thought. For example Barth&#039;s idea of the joy of a child as applied to reading a Biblical text, is currently interpreted as the Rav advocating childlike simple faith. or that Roshei Yeshivah are those who can interpret him. I think it can be done and someone once gave an AJS paper on Rav Soloveitchik, Barth, and Lindbeck.(the person still has not published it). I have a paper on Rav Soloveitchik and Barth from 2004  in the Van Leer volume that should appear soon. 
The other Jewish thinkers influenced by Barth include Wyschogrod, Leibowitz, and Eliezer Goldman. What do you think?
Would you like to do a post on John Franke applied to Judaism?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What strikes me particularly about Stanely Grenz is that he argues evangelicalism need not abandon it fundamental message in order to adequately respond to post-modernism. In particular he formulates a theology which preserves the evangelical meta-narrative as well the importance of borders and he does this without ignoring the post-modern critique. In a certain sense his arguement seems to be similar the way in which early mordern Orthodox leaders defended modern Orthodoxy and I think his works are particulary important if we are trying to formulate a post-modern Orthodoxy. There is a distinction between his approach and that of the emergents who seem to accept even more of post-modernism.
You&#039;re probably right about the differences between neo-hassidism and new monasctism though there may be certain neo-hassidic communities, like elat hayyim, that are similar to new monasctism. 
In terms of other evangelical theologians of interest. I think John Franke has continued in Grenz&#039;s path and is an interesting thinker. Franke seems to think Barth is a particularly important thinker for formulating post-modern theology. Could the writings of Rav Soloveitchik that were influenced by Barth serve as a resource for doing post-modern orthodox theology? Are there other Jewish theologians that have been influenced by Barth and could serve as a similar resource?]]></description>

Mission in this context is closer to the way Jews use the words activism, tikun olam, and working to do God&#039;s will, to let people know the message. Are you part of the Independent minyanim? You sound like you are advocating them, or maybe idealizing them. I said at the top that this is for gen x and gen y. I never thought that they apply to those older no matter how liberal they are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually find the Emergent/Emergin Church most relevant to Generation X &#038; Y.

I think that the Emergent Church most parallels Independent Minyanim. 

They are post-Carlebach (parallel to Charismatic). They emphasize community, inclusiveness, social justice, praying and learning together. They reject dogma.

The Emergent Church&#039;s issues with Missionizing is more a Christian than a Jewish issue, as missionizing is central to Christianity and in particular Evangelical Christianity. However, the fact that Independent Minyanim are premised on the idea that all members respect each other&#039;s beliefs and practices and do not seek to change them (in strong contrast to Chabad, Beginniners Minyanim or MJE) is significant.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Monasticism

New Monstasticism is strongly parallel to Independent Minyanim as they are both about creating new forms of community outside of existing structures with a strong emphasis on being welcoming, social justice and personal engagement with the tradition. Additionally, they are both about mining the Tradition to find what you mind personally meaningful.

Lastly, their politics line up.]]></description>

  Orthopraxy - Many modern Orthodox Jews (Intellectual ) follow this it helps them live in the Modern world yet maintain a Traditional lifestyle .
    Missional - We are influenced by the trends in society , you see more MO Jewish  students involved in Tikkun olam ,and the new found emphasis on ethics ,( a backlash to the scandals and  Religious establishment that values Tribalism over ethics .
    Praxisoriented - has started to gain some traction]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whatever trends you think you see in Orthodoxy or elsewhere are in my opinion  miniscule. A chabura here, an organization there, the numbers seem to me to be very small. The big trend in my opinion is a Jewish denominational life that is fragmenting or dying with most people feeling isolated and out of touch with a larger whole.

My friend is working on the Mitzva project of the Conservative movement. This is supposed to be a big deal, a major initiative, a new way of revitalizing shuls. Maybe, if only, let us pray, but meanwhile I think it is one more  gurnisht.

As for Orthodoxy, this Tropper thing plus the other scandals this past year is taking its toll. The security that Orthodoxy is supposed to provide is shaken, and I think will lead religious people to turn at least initially even more inward. We will have even more people where the  first identity is a stripe (eg Belz, Lubavitch, yeshivish-yeshivish) and the more diffused identity is Orthodox. These scandals are very difficult to integrate. There has never been a time like this, where the laity have a basic moral sense of right and wrong  far more sensitive and far less distorted and self serving than the rabbinical leadership.  We are not going post modern, we are going back to the Renaissance papacy. There has not been a single area of vice or stealing, other than gays and burkas , where the charedi leadership has not been much more blasé and decadent than the laity. It&#039;s extraordinary.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I picked this article because it was a handle for those new to these terms to be able to sort out post-evangelical, emergent, post-modern, the turn to praxis and social agendas. That is why I gave the caveat at the end about not treating this article as definitive.  
The connection of ironic faith and Rav Shagar is a good point but most Americans still do not know his writings or the message of his writings.
Since I see you are familiar with the topic: Is there anything that particularly strikes you in Stanley Grenz more than other attempts? Any other post-modern Christian thinkers that you think people should know?
On new monasticism and neo-hassidism, I find that they are playing themselves out differently but I cannot completely place my finger on it. The new monastics are writing about how to live monastically at house, cut out media, and figure out how to apply the older ascetic virtues of solitude, purity, simplicity, tranquility, generosity, and selflessness.
I do not see neo-hasidism going the same route; I see them actually avoiding these topics.   Any further thoughts?
On good works - I do see the interest in the new generation, especially among liberal Jews but within orthodoxy it needs to be discussed more. The good works seem to be more episodic, or left for select individuals, it seems more cerebral, and with more resistance from the establishment. But that is only my first impression.]]></description>
