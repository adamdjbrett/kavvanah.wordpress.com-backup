					<description><![CDATA[How about Mikveh, for either men or women.

It&#039;s rooted in Halakha. Has a &quot;magical&quot; or transformative aspect. But if you go there every day or every week, it becomes just a place to hang out.

As for a special practive, Metzitzah B&#039;Peh become more special when it was challenged, if only for medical reasons.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a religion where so many aspects of everyday life carry some halakhic valence the question is why certain things become &#039;special&#039;. 

Does study in the bet midrash become more special when it is an elitist enterprise? does it lose that when it is more open to the masses and everyone is learning something yomit.  

Does tzniut become special, at least in rhetoric, because it is special for women, or because there is a unique frisson of an embodied religious duty that also makes one conscious of an almost panoptic sexual gaze?

Is there a connection between the loss moments of religious experience and increased fundamentalism? Regular ritual and belief is no longer special enough to produce a feeling of spiritual engagement so there is a turn to more chumrot and extreme levels of observance that must constantly be shifted to redeem ritual from habit?

I am also concerned that the category that she attempts to introduce is overly thin and broad, and not very useful. We want to know what symbolic/performative/rhetorical/etc aspects make things &quot;special&quot; not merely that they are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know a frum MD therapist who tells me he still gets people with magidim and other phenomena. In our culture there is no criteria for treating them as special but many less exotic things are treated as special. The MD wants to write an article at some point with me on these phenomena  - Taves offers the cultural observations.]]></description>

I see that, but at what point do the categories-- &quot;special&quot; in this case, just become too thin?]]></description>

Read the first book first, she is filled with a keen eye for how people relate to phenomena. She is not a phenomenologist but a historian with a good eye. She is good on topic like how the religious can treat psychology, Freud, pop-psych as religious experience and giving the historical narrative of why they choose to do that.]]></description>
