					<description><![CDATA[Stroumsa is not as typological in separating out Halakha and whatever else-- Halakha has Almohad and Maliki precedents, and everything else from Epistles to Moreh has those influences too.

What WERE you talking about though? Maybe we are talking past one another?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stroumsa deals with quite a few halakhic examples throughout the book. Among these are: Maimonides&#039;s solution to a quarreling couple (borrowed from maliki jurisprudence), Maimonides&#039;s putting knowledge of God in Halakha (from Almohads and Avicenna), Maimonides on a woman going to work against husband&#039;s wishes (he does not really allow it) and other queries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe that you are correct- but I am waiting for my review copy to arrive. She does name drop the works of Islamic law and Islamic schools of law that should be consulted.

					<description><![CDATA[How about asking why this was the permanent twilight of the Jewish/Muslim encounter in the Mediterranean world? In other words, if we believe Stroumsa, thirty years after Rambam, we get the same misunderstandings we have kept for a thousand years. How did the entire social imaginary of this Mediterranean really just vanish? Or did it?]]></description>
