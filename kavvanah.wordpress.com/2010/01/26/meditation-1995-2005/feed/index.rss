					<description><![CDATA[In my relatively well-informed opinion, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a diminution of meditation opportunities nor attendance.

Makor Or, the Institute of Jewish Spirituality, Elat Chayyim are all alive and doing reasonably well with their meditation and training programs.  

Rabbi Dorothy Richman has filled in for the late Rabbi Alan Lew at Makor Or, and Zoketsu Norman Fischer (“Everyday Zen” and San Francisco Zen Center) is still active in the leadership and teaching.  They&#039;re holding classes and sittings at the JCC in San Francisco.  By the reports I&#039;ve heard, they&#039;re not quite thriving but they&#039;re also not anywhere close closing their doors.

The Institute for Jewish Spirituality just held their week-long training class in San Diego.  Any news about attendamce?

Elat Chayyim has had a reasonably full schedule of meditation retreats, including a week-long one with the Coopers a few weeks ago in December.

In the Renewal world, the Coopers, Jeff Roth and Joanna Katz, Rami Shapiro, Gershon Winkler ,Shefa Gold and Nan Fink Gefen are all still in demand to lead weekend and week-long meditation retreats.

Nishmat Hayyim up in the Boston area seems busy, with Jay Michaelson hosting a Tu B’shvat 

Makom (The Center for Mindfulness) at the JCC in Manhattan has a full schedule of meditation classes, and seems to have more teachers than ever.

According to the folks in the Orthodox Jewish community in Boulder CO, there are still as many Jews as there ever were (if not more) enrolling at Naropa (Chogyam Trungpa&#039;s Tibetan Buddhist university).  They&#039;re not attracted there for the food (though I hear that&#039;s pretty good too).

The Jewish Meditation Center of Brooklyn opened this past Fall, and I’ve seen them grow to have 18 people at their last Monday night sitting.  Seems like healthy growth to me.

In Israel, Pardes has Rabbi James Jacobson-Maisels teaching a popular meditation program.  Rabbi Natan Ophir is active too.

Two of the local Zen groups in Northern NJ, one run by Fr. Robert E. Kennedy S.J. (in Jersey City) and another by Paul Genki Kahn Roshi (in Wyckoff, both are Dharma heirs of Bernie Glassman Roshi), are active.  They sponsor daily and weekly zazen sittings, and regular weekend retreats.  Neither seems to be shrinking appreciably.]]></description>
