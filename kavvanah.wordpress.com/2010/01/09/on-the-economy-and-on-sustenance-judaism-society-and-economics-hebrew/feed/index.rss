					<description><![CDATA[Given the high inequality in Israel and social fragmentation that is happening, and given the devastation of free market anti-regulatory practices worldwide, is this discovery of individualism really such a good idea? It does raise some interesting questions about how religious ideas and beliefs are in many ways products of their environment. Gramsci talked about this when he said that there was not one Catholicism, but that  each class and sector of Italian society had a completely different religious system, even though it was all called Catholic. This is probably true of Judaism as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/01/09/on-the-economy-and-on-sustenance-judaism-society-and-economics-hebrew/#comment-1065&quot;&gt;Dina&lt;/a&gt;.

It was mainly as I summarized it, most of the articles were written from the perspective of self and not labor and regulation.
In Israel they are trying to move beyond a period of socialism and toward greater individualism. For example, there is a great article by Benny Brown given at Van Leer comparing Rav Moshe Feinstein and Rav Untermann on unions and labor rights. Brown shows that Rav Moshe basically formulated the question and answer from the perspective of American individual rights and democracy and that Rav Unterman formulated the problems using the ideas of Italian fascists and the need for the individual to subsume themselves into their work for the state. The current wave of halakhic libertarianism is not the same thing as concern with the self in either the Rav Moshe or Rav Nahman of Bratzlav sense. I do not know enough about the economic thought of baalei teshuvah I sense that there is a wide latitude of opinion. Those who write for Beit Morahsa are not dealing with baalei teshuvah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are there any articles on labor relations? What about income distribution and inequality? How about business ethics (particularly in relation to investors, borrowers and consumers)?

Do you think that there is an excessive emphasis on the self in both mainstream economics and hozrei be-tshuva? How about the relative weight of mitzvot ha-guf vs. social mitzvot and which should take precedence these days?]]></description>
