					<description><![CDATA[Interestingly, Evangelical Christian and Modern Orthodox discourses on sexuality in general have not been running in parallel while here there is a convergence.

To me it&#039;s clear that for the most part when people in these communities speak about homosexuality, they are not really talking about sex in the way that they think about heterosexuality. Heter0-normativity prevents both communities form thinking about homosexual sex as an aspect of a romantic relationship (in fact from the Twersky&#039;s response  it was the idea of a homosexual romantic relationship that he found disturbing as intercourse itself was never mentioned by the panelists)

My point is that if these were simply discourses about sin and sinners there would be greater historical divergence as the two communities view sin differently (and in the Jewish response you might see an emphasis on tikkunim and the like). But here there is a common discourse driven by among other factors the push for gay marriage, seeking to cast homosexual romance, relationships and families as normal.

As such there really is a common cultural hetero-normative assumption being challenged and both communities are forced to deal with it in similar terms.

It would be interesting to look at the responses on the part of the gay men in both cases because for the MO the question is phrased as how do you reconcile yourself to halakha vs how do you experience the presence of Jesus for the Evangelicals. 

For the former the question is  how do you relate to the external halakah, and the answer usually involves &quot;here&#039;s how I understand this text or this term&quot; while for the latter the question seems to be much more phenomenological - do you experience Jesus as sinner or as saved?]]></description>
