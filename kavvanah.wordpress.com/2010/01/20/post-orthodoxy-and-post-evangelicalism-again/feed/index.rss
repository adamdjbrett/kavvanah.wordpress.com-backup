An MO friend from Park Slope has become a Breslover chosid.  I think his wife was interested in Reb Nachman, they started studying his writings together, and it spoke to them.  They now live in Har Nof.

He once said to me, &quot;The strength of Breslov is that anybody can become a Breslover.  But the weakness of Breslov is that *anybody* can become a Breslover.&quot;]]></description>

R&#039; Brill:

&#062;In America, the other religious groups do not play a role in Jewish thinking.

Are you so sure?  There&#039;s a lot of alignment with over-arching politico-religious groups among the Jews.  E.g., many Centrist and RWMO identify with the Religious Right, even though a careful examination of the Jewish vs. Evangelical/Protestant positions on political pivot issues like abortion and homosexuality reveals that they aren&#039;t really so aligned. 

One yeshivish rav, and only one that I know of, endorses the pro-choice position because he feels (as I do) that the various Christian positions on abortion vs. life of the mother do not line up with Halacha on this matter, and we don&#039;t want the goyim telling us when we can &#038; can&#039;t have an abortion.  Halacha allows an exception for mental health of the mother (she convinces the rabbi &#038; her psychologist that she&#039;d rather kill herself than bear this baby to term), at least according to some; I haven&#039;t heard of Christians allowing this kind of &quot;subjective&quot; exception.  Judaism goes more on a case-by-case basis for these sorts of personal somatic-integrity questions than a law created by Christians would allow.

And is there no reflexive alignment between LWMO and religio-politically left positions?  Other than on Israel, of course, where most serious lefty Jews depart from Leftist orthodoxy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciated reading this post because it reflected what I have been observing for a while now among my peers. I was at Limmud-NY this past year and was indeed surprised how many a)fellow graduates of YC and Stern were in attendance, and b) how fully everyone participated in the general culture of the event- trying out various davening options, attending post-denominational panels and shiruim, and dancing in mixed circles at Havdalah. It wasn&#039;t really exactly the relaxing of halakhic observance we&#039;ve always seen in places like the UWS, it felt like something else. I attended one multi-denominational panel  where there were obvious differences between the panelists, but actually none of these differences really amounted to clear theological disagreements. It actually made the panel kind of boring, I&#039;m not sure inter-denominational dialogue is going to be able to work in the same way in this climate.]]></description>

If you think the post has anything to do with baby-boomers, liberals, feminists, or the 1990&#039;s then you are not grasping the analogy.  Better example of loosening of authority is the following by the younger set of Rav Nahman as a dead rebbe. You have no authority but get to dress Haredi and at the same time get to create an artistic, musical, and emotional religion.
I hear that Limmud-NY had a large Orthodox contingent this year, you should speak to the younger attendees.
(This was a reply to Arie not Sarah-I am not sure why it threaded this way.)]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;Let’s keep the discussion to Jews and leave what IM thinks alone. &lt;/em&gt;

Ah, but I did suggest this matter of interest within Orthodoxy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Practically applied: we do see groups that no longer choose a rabbi or possek, but have a halakhic advisor, instead. But do post-people really abhor the function of authority, or would they identify with the following reformulation: the idea that the primary role of a [clergy member] is to defines how other [adherents of the faith] as wrong what is right?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Look at the places that adopted Mendel Shapiro&#039;s paper on giving women &#039;aliyot, in the Edah Journal as a psak, even though he (claims?) it was never intended that way. (Never mind his intentions, halakhic rulings don&#039;t usually develop straight out of journals.) Those are largely places that have only halakhic advisors or committees, rather than congregational rabbis.

Let&#039;s keep the discussion to Jews and leave what IM thinks alone.  he does not need us descending on him.  
They are reacting not to the abstract idea of authority but that too many religious people were creating boundaries, labels. and definition over the last 20 years.  Reformulations would already be a next step.
There is certainly post-Conservative and Reform and many changes happening and about to happen, so I hear. But I limit the blog to the little corner that I live in. And I do not want to encourage Orthodox Jews commentors to engage in their fantasies of what these groups are thinking.
In America, the other religious groups do not play a role in Jewish thinking. I read a good article on the increase in Hindu religion, but did not post it becuase I was not looking for Hindu commentors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You cite IM:
&lt;em&gt;I mean that I reject the idea that the primary role of a minister is to define other Christians as wrong.&lt;/em&gt;

Interesting. Are there some people who see their minister&#039;s role that way? IM was obviously trying to talk about the gatekeeper role of clergy in their respective faith communities. That is indeed important (think of the role of batei din and city rabbinates in establishing who is a Jew). But is it anyone&#039;s &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; role? And is IM objecting to the gatekeeper role altogether, or only to the stern gatekeeper type who acts with vengeance, rather than kindly and filled with love and empathy for the other?

Practically applied: we do see groups that no longer choose a rabbi or possek, but have a halakhic advisor, instead. But do post-people really abhor the function of authority, or would they identify with the following reformulation: &lt;em&gt;the idea that the primary role of a [clergy member] is to defineshow other [adherents of the faith] as wrong what is right&lt;/em&gt;?

Now a little curious question. You wrote:
&lt;em&gt;This year is a sense of the post-Evangelical era. (There is also post-Mormonism)&lt;/em&gt;

Is there also post-Islamism? Post-Budhism? If so, how does it compare? If not, why not? By the way, Google didn&#039;t bring up anything useful on these two search terms.

Does it also happen in the opposite direction, namely, is there post-Conservative/Reform (I am not talking about Orthodox ba&#039;alei teshuvah)?]]></description>
