					<description><![CDATA[1) In re-reading the comments, I noticed that AB was looking for solutions, not problems. One possibility would be to hire Israelis to teach Limudei Kodesh who would come to the USA for 3-5 and could be paid significantly less than Americas. 

General studies could use either the online or charter school model. Or, alternatively, use a charitable model of using retired or semi-retired community members who would teach at a reduced rate. 

Of course, this would require pushing the reset button on the current pay/hiring model, so it may only be viable for new schools or for schools willing to close down and start from scratch. 

A major problem would be what to do with the legacy issue of Rabbeim who have been teaching for 10+ years, but who are no longer affordable. 

Izgad. You overestimate how hard it would be for public schools to assimilate Haredim. If they can assimilate muslim immigrants who cover their head (just take the NYC subways) or my super&#039;s daughter who didn&#039;t speak a word of English before schools, they should have little problem assimilating Haredi children who are, by and large, culturally American anyway.]]></description>

Interesting use of Malcolm Gladwell’s Tipping Point! So how many and what kind of Jews would it take to make public school acceptable. I have this idea that the Haredim in New York could try calling society’s bluff. What would happen if Haredim in very Orthodox neighborhoods would send their kids to public school in numbers that they could take it over?]]></description>

The choice is very stark - having [many] fewer kids and sending them to Jewish day schools or having more kids and sending them elsewhere.

The decision is simple - have ~2 kids and send them to Jewish day schools or have ~5 kids and send them elsewhere. I have 5 kids and made my decision (at least for now).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe that an important element of this discussion is how important sending one&#039;s children to a Jewish school is to a Modern Orthodox Jewish Identity.

Almost all Modern Orthodox (and all Orthodox) instinctively think that one cannot be Orthodox without sending their kids to Jewish Schools. 

Once sending ones kids to public schools becomes not just a viable option, but reaches a tipping point where it is &quot;normal&quot;, and one can consider themselves self-respecting Orthodox Jews, even though their children are in public schools, then I expect many more parents to start sending their kids to public schools.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see your point. I suppose then the question then is that as far as I can tell many MO suburban communities are comprised mainly of a professional class whose earnings tend to fall in a range such that most families do not deviate too greatly from the median. However, if the median income in these communities cannot support putting 4 kids through day school, then the logical thing to do would be to move where the cost of living is lower. But instead of couples buying houses in such places they tend to move where they apparently can&#039;t afford to live further driving up the cost of real estate and property taxes in these neighborhoods. 

So perhaps there is an inability to accept the reality that those who grew up in the 80s-90s will tend not to of not being as successful as their parents given that their idea of a successful life means living in the inner suburbs and paying for their kids educations from nursery through college. 

Also, if you look at places that are huge economic attractors, while some areas have created sizable communities like Silver Spring, more recently in Florida, perhaps beginning in Houston now, other areas that tend to be magnets for professionals have not and I wonder whether there is a general explanation that underlies  these trends.

I think that a long term solution to the school problems needs to think along the lines of creating more sustainable communities overall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I need you to free associate a bit more in order for me to be able to answer your question.  Without fully understanding the emphasis of your question, I offer the following observations as a basis for a definition of your question.

Centrism was linked to a specific socio-economic trend that linked religion, ideology, and lifestyle as one. Everyone was a professional and moderately successful.  

In the 1970&#039;s  people understood that some sibling would be rich and some poor, some religious and some not. Riv-Ellen Prell deals with some of these anxieties in 1970&#039;s Jewish suburbia. An era of Jap jokes, over the top bar mitzvah&#039;s, and stereotypes of the Jewish husbands never home.

I dont think shuls and kosher restaurants are the convenience. It is the community. Centrist is tied to a narrow lifestyle range.  Out of town does things differently and people are uncomfortable with out of town. 

Everyone assumes that they are the same as the guys with whom  they attended  yeshiva and camp. They dont take into account that social distinctions occur. You are no longer in the same class, caste, economic strata as your classmates. In the 1970&#039;s it was understood that people fan out.  If one is not Centrist Orthodox a law partner, and the IT guy in the firm and the guy in the mail room live in three different neighborhoods. In orthodoxy, everyone lives together. There is not a sense that live goes on changing and economic and social changes occur.
As noted above, there is a sense of entitlement in the community that everyone should have the same wealth, class, caste. 
I do think many have moved away. Some to Florida and elsewhere. Some to Passaic. But many more to Queens and Brooklyn.  They can live their lives differently in those places.

Since historically Jews and the most mobile group, I am not sure how great the reluctance actually is. The Jewish demographic statistics from 2010-2012 will offer hard numbers.

Try reformulating the question.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Brill, In relation to this topic I wonder if you could comment on the unwillingness of MO families to move out of large enclaves to reinforce or establish smaller communities in areas with lower costs of living.

In the 60s-70s it seems that more people born and bred in the inner boroughs were willing to move outward to places where there were growing job markets for professionals and worry about schools later. Was this originally driven solely as a byproduct of white flight or were there other factors? 

Now the children who grew up in these suburbs gravitate to them almost exclusively. And unfortunately they happen to be in places with some of the highest overall rates of taxation in the entire country. 

Perhaps this is less about an unwillingness to compromise on schools and more of an unwillingness to compromise on a large selection of shuls and kosher restaurants.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For some reason I keep coming back to this question of day school education. Lately I have begun to think that the latent assumption of the system right now is that even if it is not (for arguments sake) too expensive, it cannot be scaled up. This hinders any evangelism on the part of MO jews-- we cannot accept 20,000 Africans or even a bunch of disaffected Haredim. The Mormons can. 
If day schools did collapse, might we see an inverse proportionate rise in MO evangelism? With a scaled down supplementary model you might also need bigger numbers to compensate for bigger dropout.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Out my window, I can see a row of red-brick buildings in a hodgepodge of institutional styles. They&#039;re the physical evidence of the largest Catholic parish in my city, which at its peak served more than 10,000 parishioners, and enrolled nearly a thousand students in its schools. In addition to the enormous church, it featured a parish house, a convent, a hospital, two school buildings, and separate gymnasia for boys and girls, all contained on a single block. The parochial school closed down several decades ago, and was shuttered. The buildings are now being retrofitted to house a charter school. The hospital is now a city-operated nursing home. The convent has been condo-ized.  Of the empire, only the church and the parish house remain. The church holds a great many funerals. The only masses that attract anything approaching a crowd are those on significant feast days. And the congregation has split in two - the vestigial Irish-Catholic remnant, and a younger and vibrant group of several hundred Hispanic families whose services are conducted in Spanish, and held separately. It&#039;s one story, but it&#039;s not an atypical narrative. 

These schools were built up a century ago, at a time when the public schools in this city were actually, well, excellent. Exemplary. Housed in brand-new facilities of their own. The Jewish community here sent their children to those public schools, and supplemented their education with Hebrew School lessons. The building that they erected to house it is now a Portugese Men&#039;s Club.  (The one into which they relocated in the &#039;50s as Jews fled to the suburbs is now a special-needs school.) The school here was progressive for its day - it offered instruction in Hebrew language when it opened at the turn of the century, which was something of a scandal - but it was not the focus of institutional energies. Its building was fairly drab, and late on the scene. By the time it went up, there were already a pair of gorgeous monumental synagogues - one for the sephardim, and one for the ashkenazim. As the original post noted, the creation of a parallel schooling system for the modern orthodox, particularly of a system that extends through high school, is a relatively recent phenomena. And, as other commenters note, it is one that may well have exceeded sustainability.

There are, I think, three reasons for the present crisis, and the Catholic parallel is instructive:

1 - &lt;i&gt;The Crisis of the Clergy&lt;/i&gt;: When Rabbi Brill was a day-school teacher of mine, he stood out from much of the faculty, a fact which was not lost on the students. Like the Catholic Clergy, the Rabbinate was once among the most prestigious outlets for young men, a path to educational opportunity and social status, particularly for those of modest backgrounds. . How many in the Modern Orthodox world would describe the pulpit or the dayschool classroom as &#039;prestigious&#039;? This goes well beyond economics. For all their problems, you can earn more teaching talmud at a day school - with better benefits - than cobbling together adjunct positions in Judaic Studies. And yet Judaic Studies programs are perennially oversubscribed, and we can&#039;t find enough Modern Orthodox dayschool teachers. (We stock our faculties with haredim, or with disappointed Judaic Studies scholars.) More recently, Modern Orthodox women have moved into the broader professional workforce in increasing numbers. A Stern alumna is more likely to be an occupational therapist than a teacher; a woman graduating Penn more likely to be a consultant than a school psychologist.  Day schools now compete for labor in the general market - fewer of their faculty feel a special sense of calling, and they&#039;re commensurately less willing to make sacrifices. In broad terms, day school teachers have grown more expensive, and perhaps relatively less extraordinary.

2 - &lt;i&gt;Upscaling&lt;/i&gt; - Jews have done well in this country. Very well, indeed. That&#039;s equally true (or, perhaps, particularly true) of the Modern Orthodox community. But as they have climbed the socioeconomic ladder, their expectations have also been raised. If the goal of a day school is to provide an education roughly equal in quality to that of a standard public school, as well as a limudei kodesh curriculum, this may be attainable at a relatively modest cost. It&#039;s a replicable model. What you lose in time and resources you gain back in demographics and parental commitment. But when the goal becomes equalling the education provided by a day school in a tony suburb, or even that of an elite preparatory school, the stakes have been raised considerably. Educational costs have been outpacing inflation throughout the country. The remarkable thing about day school tuition, frankly, is that it&#039;s not substantially higher than it is. Day schools are offering many more instructional hours for roughly the cost (to taxpayers) of elite public schools. That&#039;s actually a substantial achievement. But if a community is effectively paying for the public schools (through its property taxes) as well as the day schools, it becomes an unsustainable burden. And that&#039;s what we&#039;re facing.

3- &lt;i&gt;Integration:&lt;/i&gt; America is a vastly more comfortable place for religious Jews today than it was just a couple of decades ago. That change has manifested itself in a variety of interesting ways. One of the most counterintuitive is probably the very growth of the day school culture - the reason that the movement took off in the post-war era was that for the first time, it was possible to be both substantially and outwardly faithful to tradition and accepted by the  broader society. Until then, most Jews who wished to ascend conventional avenues of success chose the path of integration, to greater or lesser extents, and attending public schools was seen as an indispensable part of that. But as day schools have succeeded in reaching ever-broader swathes of the Jewish community. In 2004, Avi Chai counted nearly 29,000 students enrolled in 87 &#039;Modern Orthodox&#039; schools. (Overall, there were more than 200k, roughly split between chassidic/yeshivish and all other varieties.) Enrollment is still growing, and at a fairly rapid clip. That bespeaks the fundamental Orthodox commitment to Judaic education, which is laudable. But it&#039;s also produced a heavy irony -  in siphoning off the most affluent segment of the centrist and modern orthodox communities, day schools effectively crowded-out other forms of Orthodox Judaic education. I can&#039;t think of a town with an orthodox day school &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; an orthodox after-school program.  The old ways of balancing tradition and integration - pursuing both in tandem - gave way to the new approach of pursuing both at the same time. In many ways, this has been fabulous. But as increasing numbers of families succumb to the rapidly increasing financial pressure, there simply isn&#039;t any infrastructure left to support them. It&#039;s become the day school or nothing - and for some families, those are two losing choices.

So the day school faculty is out of step with the students, parents, and communities. They&#039;ve grown increasingly ambitious and expensive. And their success has crowded out the older alternatives. 

If there&#039;s a lesson in the Catholic experience, it&#039;s that this doesn&#039;t end well. When communities saddle themselves with an infrastructure they are no longer interested in or capable of supporting, both the community and its institutions tend to decline more rapidly than they otherwise might. Higher and higher costs are imposed on declining numbers of participants, forcing difficult choices. And with religious affiliation generally waning, and an ever-more-welcoming civil society, it&#039;s not hard to imagine a future in which a Catholic resident of my city looks out his window, and reflects on the shuttered day school campus he sees. 

So to answer Rabbi Brill&#039;s original question, where are we headed?

I suspect (or at least, I hope) that we&#039;re going to see the revival of some of those alternative methods of education. We&#039;re living in a golden age of Jewish scholarship, but surprisingly little of it penetrates our day schools. Few products of Judaic Studies programs are interested in teaching at day schools; some of the brightest graduates of our rabbinical programs take their smicha, and pursue alternative careers. There&#039;s a vast talent pool out there that&#039;s largely untapped for secondary education.

What about part-time education with part-time educators? It&#039;s a model that seems particularly viable in affluent suburbs that are blessed with superb public middle- and high-schools. Committed Orthodox families could send their children to day school for elementary, ensuring that they have a proper grounding in both the values and technical skills of Judaic education. But pulling them out after 5th or 8th grade would dramatically lower the cost of a Jewish education. Given that half of the curriculum of day schools is already offered - and often at a much higher level - at public schools, the important thing would be to offer the other half. 

Most Hebrew High Schools are fairly desultory affairs, staffed by well-meaning teachers and disinterested students. For the most part, their enrollees are not day-school graduates. But imagine, if you will, a Hebrew High School staffed with teachers who are brighter and better-qualified than the instructors these students encounter during the week. Holders of Judaic Studies doctorates, frustrated musmachs of YU unsatisfied practicing law - there are any number of immensely qualified people who could teach a few hours a week, but who are uninterested in committing to a full time school job. And if the students have significant background, the strong and committed support of their parents, and are embedded within a vibrant orthodox community and thriving shul, there&#039;s reason to think that their attitudes would also be different from those currently enrolled in such institutions, who largely hail from less religious backgrounds.

I see us at a forking point. We can pursue the Catholic path, and prepare to hit a point at which the attractions of our community are overwhelmed by its costs. Or we can create a second set of institutions, capable of weaving an equally strong community at a fraction of the price.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Out my window, I can see a row of red-brick buildings in a hodgepodge of institutional styles. They&#8217;re the physical evidence of the largest Catholic parish in my city, which at its peak served more than 10,000 parishioners, and enrolled nearly a thousand students in its schools. In addition to the enormous church, it featured a parish house, a convent, a hospital, two school buildings, and separate gymnasia for boys and girls, all contained on a single block. The parochial school closed down several decades ago, and was shuttered. The buildings are now being retrofitted to house a charter school. The hospital is now a city-operated nursing home. The convent has been condo-ized.  Of the empire, only the church and the parish house remain. The church holds a great many funerals. The only masses that attract anything approaching a crowd are those on significant feast days. And the congregation has split in two &#8211; the vestigial Irish-Catholic remnant, and a younger and vibrant group of several hundred Hispanic families whose services are conducted in Spanish, and held separately. It&#8217;s one story, but it&#8217;s not an atypical narrative. </p>
<p>These schools were built up a century ago, at a time when the public schools in this city were actually, well, excellent. Exemplary. Housed in brand-new facilities of their own. The Jewish community here sent their children to those public schools, and supplemented their education with Hebrew School lessons. The building that they erected to house it is now a Portugese Men&#8217;s Club.  (The one into which they relocated in the &#8217;50s as Jews fled to the suburbs is now a special-needs school.) The school here was progressive for its day &#8211; it offered instruction in Hebrew language when it opened at the turn of the century, which was something of a scandal &#8211; but it was not the focus of institutional energies. Its building was fairly drab, and late on the scene. By the time it went up, there were already a pair of gorgeous monumental synagogues &#8211; one for the sephardim, and one for the ashkenazim. As the original post noted, the creation of a parallel schooling system for the modern orthodox, particularly of a system that extends through high school, is a relatively recent phenomena. And, as other commenters note, it is one that may well have exceeded sustainability.</p>
<p>There are, I think, three reasons for the present crisis, and the Catholic parallel is instructive:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; <i>The Crisis of the Clergy</i>: When Rabbi Brill was a day-school teacher of mine, he stood out from much of the faculty, a fact which was not lost on the students. Like the Catholic Clergy, the Rabbinate was once among the most prestigious outlets for young men, a path to educational opportunity and social status, particularly for those of modest backgrounds. . How many in the Modern Orthodox world would describe the pulpit or the dayschool classroom as &#8216;prestigious&#8217;? This goes well beyond economics. For all their problems, you can earn more teaching talmud at a day school &#8211; with better benefits &#8211; than cobbling together adjunct positions in Judaic Studies. And yet Judaic Studies programs are perennially oversubscribed, and we can&#8217;t find enough Modern Orthodox dayschool teachers. (We stock our faculties with haredim, or with disappointed Judaic Studies scholars.) More recently, Modern Orthodox women have moved into the broader professional workforce in increasing numbers. A Stern alumna is more likely to be an occupational therapist than a teacher; a woman graduating Penn more likely to be a consultant than a school psychologist.  Day schools now compete for labor in the general market &#8211; fewer of their faculty feel a special sense of calling, and they&#8217;re commensurately less willing to make sacrifices. In broad terms, day school teachers have grown more expensive, and perhaps relatively less extraordinary.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; <i>Upscaling</i> &#8211; Jews have done well in this country. Very well, indeed. That&#8217;s equally true (or, perhaps, particularly true) of the Modern Orthodox community. But as they have climbed the socioeconomic ladder, their expectations have also been raised. If the goal of a day school is to provide an education roughly equal in quality to that of a standard public school, as well as a limudei kodesh curriculum, this may be attainable at a relatively modest cost. It&#8217;s a replicable model. What you lose in time and resources you gain back in demographics and parental commitment. But when the goal becomes equalling the education provided by a day school in a tony suburb, or even that of an elite preparatory school, the stakes have been raised considerably. Educational costs have been outpacing inflation throughout the country. The remarkable thing about day school tuition, frankly, is that it&#8217;s not substantially higher than it is. Day schools are offering many more instructional hours for roughly the cost (to taxpayers) of elite public schools. That&#8217;s actually a substantial achievement. But if a community is effectively paying for the public schools (through its property taxes) as well as the day schools, it becomes an unsustainable burden. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re facing.</p>
<p>3- <i>Integration:</i> America is a vastly more comfortable place for religious Jews today than it was just a couple of decades ago. That change has manifested itself in a variety of interesting ways. One of the most counterintuitive is probably the very growth of the day school culture &#8211; the reason that the movement took off in the post-war era was that for the first time, it was possible to be both substantially and outwardly faithful to tradition and accepted by the  broader society. Until then, most Jews who wished to ascend conventional avenues of success chose the path of integration, to greater or lesser extents, and attending public schools was seen as an indispensable part of that. But as day schools have succeeded in reaching ever-broader swathes of the Jewish community. In 2004, Avi Chai counted nearly 29,000 students enrolled in 87 &#8216;Modern Orthodox&#8217; schools. (Overall, there were more than 200k, roughly split between chassidic/yeshivish and all other varieties.) Enrollment is still growing, and at a fairly rapid clip. That bespeaks the fundamental Orthodox commitment to Judaic education, which is laudable. But it&#8217;s also produced a heavy irony &#8211;  in siphoning off the most affluent segment of the centrist and modern orthodox communities, day schools effectively crowded-out other forms of Orthodox Judaic education. I can&#8217;t think of a town with an orthodox day school <b>and</b> an orthodox after-school program.  The old ways of balancing tradition and integration &#8211; pursuing both in tandem &#8211; gave way to the new approach of pursuing both at the same time. In many ways, this has been fabulous. But as increasing numbers of families succumb to the rapidly increasing financial pressure, there simply isn&#8217;t any infrastructure left to support them. It&#8217;s become the day school or nothing &#8211; and for some families, those are two losing choices.</p>
<p>So the day school faculty is out of step with the students, parents, and communities. They&#8217;ve grown increasingly ambitious and expensive. And their success has crowded out the older alternatives. </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a lesson in the Catholic experience, it&#8217;s that this doesn&#8217;t end well. When communities saddle themselves with an infrastructure they are no longer interested in or capable of supporting, both the community and its institutions tend to decline more rapidly than they otherwise might. Higher and higher costs are imposed on declining numbers of participants, forcing difficult choices. And with religious affiliation generally waning, and an ever-more-welcoming civil society, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine a future in which a Catholic resident of my city looks out his window, and reflects on the shuttered day school campus he sees. </p>
<p>So to answer Rabbi Brill&#8217;s original question, where are we headed?</p>
<p>I suspect (or at least, I hope) that we&#8217;re going to see the revival of some of those alternative methods of education. We&#8217;re living in a golden age of Jewish scholarship, but surprisingly little of it penetrates our day schools. Few products of Judaic Studies programs are interested in teaching at day schools; some of the brightest graduates of our rabbinical programs take their smicha, and pursue alternative careers. There&#8217;s a vast talent pool out there that&#8217;s largely untapped for secondary education.</p>
<p>What about part-time education with part-time educators? It&#8217;s a model that seems particularly viable in affluent suburbs that are blessed with superb public middle- and high-schools. Committed Orthodox families could send their children to day school for elementary, ensuring that they have a proper grounding in both the values and technical skills of Judaic education. But pulling them out after 5th or 8th grade would dramatically lower the cost of a Jewish education. Given that half of the curriculum of day schools is already offered &#8211; and often at a much higher level &#8211; at public schools, the important thing would be to offer the other half. </p>
<p>Most Hebrew High Schools are fairly desultory affairs, staffed by well-meaning teachers and disinterested students. For the most part, their enrollees are not day-school graduates. But imagine, if you will, a Hebrew High School staffed with teachers who are brighter and better-qualified than the instructors these students encounter during the week.

					<description><![CDATA[Economy for Catholic schools is different than for most Jewish schools, I think, not having a lot of experience of either.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/catholic-schools-and-jewish-day-schools/#comment-424&quot;&gt;chakira&lt;/a&gt;.

chakira, want to do a serious Pierre Bourdieu analysis of the income aspiration? In addition, Bourdieu has an essay on the economic of houses of worship and the importance of having underpaid women to make Church life work. There are probably a lot of valuable insights in  the article for the Orthodox community.
Which reminds me of a statistic that may play a large role in these discussions. Whenever Modern Orthodoxy is compared to Evangelicals, one of the statistics that stands out is that Evangelical want only  the man to work, for modern orthodox - both spouses work. So there are less female teachers to make the school work. There is also a statistic out there that MO couples are closer in education and profession than Reform and Conservative couples. I dont remember which study it is, but they have more synagogue ladies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to be so insistent on this point. But almost every commenter wants to attribute day school to some religious ideal. It is almost as we are debating the relative merits of various pietistic practices. For better or for worse, I think we are discussing something altogether different.

If you read the comments over on HF, fast approaching 300, this becomes clear as day.

We are not discussing invisible modes of causation here, we are discussing visible modes of aspiration. On one side are people who aspire to the high pricetag MO lifestyle. On the other are those who are in the club, increasingly resentful of the burdens of the arrivistes. The latter are paying good money to reproduce their values and are tired of paying for the former.
