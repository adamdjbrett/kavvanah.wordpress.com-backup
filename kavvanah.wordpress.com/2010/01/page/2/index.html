				<p>There is a new book <strong>Sarah Stroumsa: Maimonides in His World</strong> Princeton University Press  2009. I await my copy to arrive and for the reviews to start appearing. In the meantime, in her first chapter she describes the Islamic Mediterranean culture in which Maimonides worked and which she will use as the framework for her book. She paints Maimonides as the end of an era of Arabic-Jewish integration.</p>
<p>In this approach, she is similar to the method of Steven Wasserstrom, <em>Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam. Between the 8th and 12th centuries</em>, Jewish culture was tied up in Shiia and Ismaeli thought, in the formation of hadith collections, and Islamic legal schools, in the machinations of Caliphs, in Arabic poetics, and Islamic science.  Maimonides thoughts as he wrote them, were not the start of something new, rather the final summery, reflection, and synthesis of a different age. She credits this approach to S. D. Goitoin and others.</p>
<p>In this approach, the Maimonides of his time is different than the Maimonides of thirty years after his death and then the subsequent use in the Beit Midrash. The former Maimonides spoke and read Arabic and Berber, had Muslim colleagues, and needs to be situated in a world of Farabi, Ibn Sina, ibn Bajjah and the fiqh of Al Ghazzali and debates between Hanafi and Maliki schools of law, and the Ismaeli Qadi al- Nu man’s “Pillars of Islam.&#8221; In many aspects, Maimonides was quite conservative compared to the religious options his age. In contrast, the Maimonides of the Beit Midrash is a about a European reception of his works in Hebrew. In Provence, Maimonides was read with Hebrew translations of Farabi, and ibn Sina, but the original world has been lost.</p>
<p><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9062.pdf">First Chapter as pdf</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The “Mediterranean culture” that shaped Maimonides had, of course,  produced other Jewish leaders and scholars. It is interesting to compare  Maimonides to another “Mediterranean thinker” of impressive stature, Saadia ben Yosef Fayyumi, alias Saadia Gaon (d. 942).80 Like Maimonides’, Saadia’s thought was shaped by his education, travels, readings, and personal encounters, and included the legacy of different schools<br />
and religious communities. Like Maimonides’, Saadia’s originality lies in  his ability to integrate these diverse sources of influence into a coherent Jewish thought, speaking the universal cultural language of his time while  yet remaining entirely Jewish. The differences between the tenth-century  Saadia and the twelfth- century Maimonides are not only differences of  personality. The distinctive characters of their respective “cultural Mediterraneans” reflect the turning point in the twelfth century. Both Saadia and Maimonides can be seen as high- water marks of the Jewish Mediterranean society. Saadia, in the tenth century, marks the consolidation and coming of age of the Judaeo- Arabic Mediterranean culture. Maimonides, at the close of the twelfth century, marks the turning of the tide, the end of an era: the beginning of the waning of Islamic culture, the rise of Europe an intellectual power, and, as part of this process, the great shift occurring within the Jewish world.</p>
<p>In modern parlance, he could  perhaps be called “cosmopolitan,” that is, a person who belongs to more  than one of the subcultures that together form the world in which he  lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even some of his famous statements in his commentary on the Mishnah reflect the world in which he lived and book that were known to his readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ibn  Qutayba (d. 889), a traditional Muslim scholar, wrote an anthology of edifying material for the state secretaries, in the introduction to which we find him quoting the Prophet Muhammad’s learned cousin, Ibn Abbas, who had said: <strong>“Take wisdom from whomever you may hear it,</strong> for wisdom can come from the non- wise.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update: </strong></p>
<p>I thank my reader Jeff for pointing me to a recent book review by <a href="http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=18427">David Burrell at NDPR- here</a>. In general I recommend highly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Unknowable-God-David-Burrell/dp/0268012261">David Burrell’s Knowing The Unknowable God</a> as an easy to read introduction to the trajectory of Farabi-Maimonides-Aquinas.</p>
<p>Burrell chose the same passage, which I chose, from the first chapter to illustrate her approach. According to Burrell’s summary of  Stroumsa, in the chapters which I have not read yet&#8212;Maimonides was influenced by the Fundamentalist Almohad world of his youth, including his view of the unity of God, his definition of a leader, and his messainism. But unlike the Islamic world where jurist and philosophers were not the same social roles,  Maimonides in his rarely-found dual role could offer a more creative synthesis of fundamentalism and philosophy. Strousma finds a serious Ibn Sina influence on Maimonides’ vision of perfection as contemplative and erotic and ecstatic. She finds this is one of the places where Maimonides own religious belief is found.</p>
<p>She also attributes the Letter on resurrection to the Almohad heresy hunting against those falasifa who deny resurrection. (I thought for years that Bernard Septimus&#8217; work on the resurrection controversy using only Jewish sources was barking up the wrong tree for similar reasons, any introductory work on medieval Islamic thought mentions the Islamic controversy on resurrection at the end of the 12th century.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">She suggests that Maimonides&#8217; &#8220;identifying true monotheism with a noncorporeal perception of God&#8221; aligns him with Ibn Tumart&#8217;s school of thought (71). It is especially &#8220;Maimonides&#8217; overall perception of the role of the ruler that is modeled according to Almohad thought&#8221; (77). In particular, his &#8220;depiction of the Messiah is characterized by an overwhelming insistence on his military role&#8221; (78). Yet it is here that we must recall that</p>
<div style="padding-left:2.5em;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>the status of Maimonides within his own community was strikingly different from that of the Muslim philosophers of his generation within  their society[. Indeed], as the spiritual leader of a minority group, [he] could feel, perhaps more than a Muslim philosopher marginalized in the court, that he was able to shape the minds of his flock, [leaving] him, paradoxically, more freedom to adopt Almohad ideology than that left to his Muslim counterparts (79).</em></p>
</div>
<p>Chapter five, &#8220;A Critical Mind&#8221;, on Maimonides as scientist gives Stroumsa has :”a particular fascination for his obloquy towards pseudo-science, which he labels &#8220;ravings&#8221;</p>
<p>The chapter crowning the study, &#8220;&#8216;From Moses to Moses&#8217;: Maimonides&#8217; Vision of Perfection&#8221;, begins by comparing the Rambam&#8217;s concerns with those of Avicenna,… &#8220;the Guide gives us a glimpse of a positive description of Maimonides&#8217; understanding of paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on this unusual use of evocative language by the Rambam, Stroumsa proposes (and I would concur) that &#8220;his description of the bliss of the perfect souls rings with the exultation and rapture of the believer&#8221; (164). </p>
<p>Maimonides&#8217; own Treatise on Resurrection has elicited contentious commentary… Yet in the light of his clear predilection for immortality of soul, one wonders why Maimonides should insist, as he does in his &#8216;creed&#8217;, on obligatory belief in the resurrection of the dead. Stroumsa cuts the Gordian knot by suggesting that</p>
<div style="padding-left:2.5em;">
<em>in instituting a list of legally binding dogmas that define the boundaries of Judaism, [he] followed the example of the Almohads, [and especially of] their source of inspiration, Ghazali, who counted the denial of the resurrection as one of the marks of the philosophers&#8217; heresy.</em></div>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Since many did feel there is something to the comparison between Post-evangelical and Post-Orthodoxy, I will continue exploring it a bit more.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are moments that capture a certain feeling. 1946-7 was the feeling of the returning GI not going back to his hometown. 1959-was the threat of nuclear attack, 1968 was the sexual revolution and the counter-culture, and 1984 was the year of the Yuppie.None of these moments create a denomination they affect all denominations. The returning GI’s created all the suburban congregations of all denominations.</p>
<p>And the social mood of the returning GI’s- should not be quickly conflated with Film Noir and French Existentialism of the same years. Different trends and mood can occur at the same time.</p>
<p>This year is a sense of the post-Evangelical era. (There is also post-Mormonism)  It may not really kick-in for another few years. (The same way that those people who watch MadMen are able to see that things are unraveling toward the late 1960’s.) Evangelical religion was driven back by a variety of things such as the Scopes trial and Elmer Gantry in 1926. It retreated and then in the 1950’s wanted to be modern, educated and relevant.  It wanted to show that it does not have to be seen as backwards, rather it should be seen as intellectual and modern. It started growing again as a reaction to the 1970’s. By the 1990’s they were seen as mainstream.  They could show themselves as doctors, lawyers, and politicians; they are no longer backward.</p>
<p>Traditional Orthodoxy was Yiddish speaking and seen as not modern, not scientific, not family oriented, not democratic, not educated. Post WWII Modern Orthodoxy responded to these limits with concern for the modern. Then,  with the return to religion in the 1980’s, Centrist Orthodoxy embraced conservative positions on social and cultural issues combined with an identification with Yuppie values (The latter point itself is  big and important topic). And like the new Evangelicals, it effaced history and had a non sacramental approach (mizvot no longer change the worlds and performance is not cultivated). It shared a dispensational eschatology with evangelicals, Biblical promises are happening now but only as applied to Israel.</p>
<p>To return to the original Post-Evangelical post. <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/what-do-i-mean-by-post-evangelical">The Christian Blogger IM in his post What Do I Mean by Post-Evangelical? August 7, 2006 </a>notes some the history outlined above. He notes that Evangelicals were “Attempting, and largely failing, to establish a non-fundamentalist identity.” He offers a variety of thought of new turns of thought including: there is more possibilities in the classic texts and more relevant interpretations than currently taught; the boundaries of in and out matter less and the current boundary may not be true, creed is important but it is not to be used in an authoritarian way, show respect to those of other denominations; interpretation only occurs in a complex human matrix; the meaning does not fall from the sky in a magical or timeless way;  He also notes that he does not worry if some post-evangelicals are heretical or out of step- it will sort itself out over time. He states that the clergy’s role is not to define who is right and wrong. We need to return to the sources and to the spirit (experience, prophecy, intuition).</p>
<blockquote><p>We must be aware that there is far more in the Bible than the Reformation dealt with, and that many of our problems today are addressed by those hitherto unnoticed or undeveloped aspects of the Bible.</p>
<p>Those who want to bang the drum for a 450-year old tradition are dooming themselves to irrelevance. Our only concern is to avoid being beat up by them as they thrash about in their death-throes. I mean that I do not recognize the boundary lines of American evangelicalism as the boundary lines of true Christianity. I mean that creeds and confessions have positive and defining roles, but do not function as popes and unassailable authorities.</p>
<p>I mean that it has become virtually impossible to practice any form of Christian community that does not interact in some way with the larger church in history and reality. (I salute those who attempt to practice pure forms of fundamentalism, etc. They have my respect.) I mean that I do not share the hostility and suspicion of all things Catholic or catholic that is endemic to evangelicalism. I mean that I recognize that Christian belief emerges from a matrix of the text of Holy Scripture, the history of interpretation, cultural and sub-cultural presuppositions, the use of reason, the place of experience, the wisdom of the teachers of the larger church and the work of the Holy Spirit in revealing more light. I embrace this more complex understanding of Christian belief as part of the great stream of Christian existence, and I reject any notions that Christian belief falls from the sky as a magic book that exists apart from other components of human experience.</p>
<p>I mean that words like “postmodern,” “emerging” and “missional” are in the process of being defined and filled with meaning, and are not to be ridiculed and rejected out of hand because some who use them are out of step or even heretical.</p>
<p>I mean that I reject the idea that the primary role of a minister is to define other Christians as wrong. . I mean that the death of evangelicalism opens the door for a return to the sources…I mean that our reverence for previous epochs and events in church history must be tempered with an awareness that the work of the Holy Spirit in the church continues, and what was believed in the past is not immune from the light that may break forth in the ongoing present.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/what-do-i-mean-by-post-evangelical">Full version here. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>And in <a href="../../01/the-emergent-church-and-orthodoxy/index.html">the article on the Emergent Church that I posted here “The Emergent Church and Orthodoxy” </a>the author listed at least four points worth considering: Prophecy, greater focus on worship and ritual, not being worried about boundaries, and liberal politics.</p>
<p>I ask the Gen-Y/Millennials out there: How do they see themselves different than Centrism? What do they think are the sins and excesses of Centrism?</p>
<p>I ask again: How much of this is applicable to changes within Orthodoxy?  Does it sound familiar? Are their differences? Is this change inevitable? Which of these will change Orthodoxy more and which will change it less?</p>
<p>If I wanted I could collect the Facebook answers to the info line &#8220;Religious Views&#8221; to show that something is up. I have hundreds of examples of those raised Orthodox defining themselves in all sorts of convoluted ways. Don&#8217;t worry I will not do it, but a such a listing of self-identifications bespeaks a mood.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a moment or a mood – not an ideology or denomination. Post-evangelical is like Yuppie or returning GI – a set of values that will play itself out in a variety of diverse ways. How will these winds blow over the face of traditional practice? What will be the VARIED responses? I await details from those in the field.</p>

				<p>Orthodox graduate students are comfortable speaking of the influence of Greek ideas on Judaism, and will even homiletically explain it as<em> zeh leumat zeh</em> (that Jewish ideas correspond to the outside world.) And they are comfortable with their treating the <em>Guide of Perplexed </em>as Aristotelian (even if Maimonides himself thought the content was Torat Moshe). But most are not as comfortable situating twentieth century Judaism in those terms.</p>
<p>My online reader feed of web sources contains material from many faiths and they often reports on the same events occurring in several communities, within several months of the other communities and sometimes within weeks or even days. For example, having a gay speaker come to speak to the community and then the follow-up issues has occurred in many Evangelical colleges in the last year. Here is a story of a gay Christian speaking to an Evangelical college. I am not interested in the GLBT issues or the “Torah view” or identical “Christian view.”</p>
<p>I am interested in what is the conception of history that makes this possible? How do we formulate the way Jews are cultural embedded with Christians in America. What is the cultural construction? What is the hybrid? Why does the issue arise in the same months? Why does it get resolved by having a panel? Why are the arguments on both sides the same? Why does the institution react the same way on both sides?  Why does the negative reaction seen similar to the Christian response rather than the traditional Jewish language and practices of tikkunim? When Anglicans, Episcopalians, the Conservative movement within Judaism all debate the same points within a 2 year span, it seems natural. But when Orthodox Jews and Evangelicals do the same thing within months, as they do, is it just as natural?</p>
<blockquote><p><em></em><em>01/11/2010 &#8211; </em>Jonathan Odell A gay Christian speaks to fundamentalists</p>
<p>Last year I got a call from an administrator at a Midwestern seminary with a reputation for its “take no prisoners” conservative theology. He had permission to conduct a series of seminars on hot-button issues like abortion, stem-cell research, and gay marriage. His plan was to bring in a succession of speakers, one to take the pro side of an issue, followed by a second to present the opposing view.  I took a deep breath. I knew what was coming next. “We want you to take the pro side on homosexuality,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yippee,” I thought. “I get to argue for Satan.” So I asked him, “Why me?” Why me indeed&#8230;. Several years earlier I had given a reading on the same campus. It was from my novel. But I hadn’t come out as gay then, only as a Baptist.</p>
<p>“Actually,” the caller said, “I had heard you were gay before you showed up.” He told me that when the dean found out I was coming, he had done his best to cancel my reading. I had not known at the time that my gay presence was sufficient to cause a scandal. What would happen if I were to actually talk about it?<em> </em></p>
<p><em></em>The administrator pleaded his case. “I want you to come here not only because you’re gay, but because you’re religious. You’ve obviously held on to your spiritual beliefs.” I didn’t tell him I’d been able to retain my faith by steering clear of the hateful fundamentalists that universities like his turned out. Instead, I lied and told him I’d think about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>His reaction afterwards</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m here because whether I like it or not, you are in my life and I need to somehow make peace with that part of my life.”</p>
<p>But something interesting happened next, during the Q and A. The questions were not the ones I had expected. Instead, students asked thoughtfully about my life and my struggle with religion. “How do you as a gay man experience the presence of Christ in your life?” “How do you handle Christians who reject you without knowing your story?” “If your parents had not accepted you, what do you think you would have done?”</p>
<p>I would like to say everybody involved went on to live happily ever after, but life doesn’t work that way. A few professors whose students were at the session complained to the dean about my being allowed to speak. Some of the seminarians attending the session decided to push for a campus support group for friends of the GLBT community. The dean, alarmed, charged a committee to create a list of faculty and students who challenged the institution’s policy on homosexuality.</p>
<p><a href="http://commonwealmagazine.org/coming-home">Read the full version here.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I am only interested in how we explain this culturally and historically. Is the historic process any different than Centrism’s adoption of supply-side economics and moral majority rhetoric during the Reagan era? Is this any different than everyone responding to premarital sexuality in 1966-1970? Those are the years when the youth groups started having sessions on the tensions and difficulties of keeping “negiah” where everyone gets to state their difficulties in keeping the prohibition. And the thousand year tradition of a &#8220;pot of filth&#8221; became a &#8220;hedge of roses&#8221; (find the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/492709301">article by Jonah Steinberg online</a> for more details.</p>
<p>How does the hybrid of Judaism and American religion work?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The 1980&#8217;s and 1990&#8217;s attracted many original minds to Jerusalem. One of them, Moshe Kline, part-time real estate developer, devoted himself to a Torah lishmah quest for the structure of Mishnah. I was always intrigued by anyone who can discuss Leo Strauss, Maharal, and Mishnah in one sentence. My interest was originally the Maharal angle. But, I have had many colleagues who use Kline&#8217;s structured approach to the Mishnah in teaching HS or adult education.</p>
<p>An introductory lecture presenting his discovery and method as delivered to <a href="http://chaver.com/Mishnah-New/English/Articles/Introduction%20to%20the%20Structured%20Mishnah.htm">Talmoodists is available here.</a> <a href="http://moshekline.com/General/Color%20Codes/English%20Color%20Code.htm"><br />
</a><a href="http://chaver.com/General/Color%20Codes/English%20Color%20Code.htm">Having this chart</a> in front of you will help  in understanding the lecture.<br />
An article capturing his original insight <a href="http://chaver.com/Mishnah-New/English/Articles/TheArt-H.htm">based on Maharal is available here.</a><br />
The website has his articles on Bible and his complete printable color-coded Mishnah. If you want to discuss the method then please read the above articles first. <a href="http://chaver.com/">Here is the home page </a>of the website with tabs for articles on Torah and Mishnah.</p>
<p>He recently stopped by on a cold wintry NY day and answered a few questions.</p>
<p>1] <strong>What was your discovery about the Mishnah? </strong></p>
<p>The original goal of my Mishnah project was to determine the principles according to which chapters of Mishnah were organized. In order to uncover these rules, it was first necessary to identify the components of chapters. The differing divisions into mishnayot (Bavli, Yerushalmi, various printings of the Mishnah) are all late and extraneous to the text. So I began going through the Mishnah dividing the chapters into components according to literary indicators.<br />
Early on, I realized that the chapters were actually composed with two levels of division, a fact which is totally disguised by the common division into linearly-divided mishnayot. This was the key to the discovery that the chapters were composed as non-linear texts which could be visualized and understood as tables.<br />
The chapters of the Mishnah were formatted according to a paradigm that resembles a table. I then set out each chapter in a visual format consistent with its inner literary structure. The discovery of the literary structure of the chapter leads to an approach to the study of the chapter as a coherent construct rather that a collection of loosely connected laws.</p>
<p>2] <strong>Who has supported it? </strong></p>
<p>My edition of the Mishnah was accepted for publication by BGU Press on recommendation of Shamma Friedman and Daniel Boyarin. I have also received encouragement from David Weiss Halivni and Shlomo Zalman Havlin. Since I made it available online (chaver.com) about ten years ago, I have lost track of how many people actually use it. Currently people are downloading about 20-30 copies of the full text per day. In addition, several hundred individual chapters are accessed every day. So I guess a lot of people are using it.</p>
<p>3] <strong>What did you learn from Leo Strauss about reading a text?</strong></p>
<p>Although I cite <em>Persecution and the Art of Writing</em>, and see the Mishnah as an exoteric/esoteric text, I learned how to read during four years of the great-books program at St. John’s College. (Strauss retired to St. John’s as scholar in residence.) The most important element of this education, relevant to my research, is the requirement to read primary texts without commentary. This made me uncomfortable with the traditional Jewish approach to its foundational texts, i.e. that they could not be approached without commentaries. I was also influenced by the fact that the historical approach was anathema at St. John’s. Consequently, my work is neither “traditional” nor academic/historical.</p>
<p>4] <strong>What did you gain from Maharal?</strong></p>
<p>The Maharal opened the door for me to see the Mishnah as a coherent composition, primarily through his exposition of the pairs in the first chapter of Avot. He made it clear that this structure was to be read as a philosophic composition rather than a loose compilation of aphorisms.</p>
<p>5] <strong>What did you learn from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Ashkenazi_(Manitou)">Rabbi Yehuda Leon Ashkenazi (Manitou)</a>?</strong></p>
<p>From Manitou I learned first and foremost to trust in myself and my St. John’s training. After we studied Maharal together for a period of several months, I began to see other parts of Avot as literary constructs, in addition to the pairs in the first chapter. Manitou then told me that he had received a tradition that the whole of the Mishnah used to be studied in the way that I was beginning to read Avot. However, several generations ago this knowledge had been lost. He asked me to restore this knowledge by identifying the literary structure of the Mishnah. He was sure that the “kabbala” was embedded in the formal structure, or in his words, that the Mishnah was constructed according to the “kabbala”. However, he instructed me to avoid reference to this in my work, and limit myself to literary analysis. Monitou gave me my life’s work, which has now gone farther than he envisioned.</p>
<p>6] <strong>What are you current Bible projects?</strong></p>
<p>I am preparing a structured edition of the Torah which is similar to my edition of the Mishnah. In the meantime, I have published articles on Leviticus. Jacob Milgrom has become my mentor in biblical studies. I am also finishing an article on the link between the structure of the Torah and the structure of the Mishnah. In it, I demonstrate that Rabbi had an esoteric tradition regarding the literary formatting of the Torah which he applied to the composition of the Mishnah.</p>
<p>The paradigm can be seen in the first chapter of the Torah through the six days of creation. We all are familiar with the parallels between days 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6. These parallels actually divide the days into two parallel cycles of three days each, 1-3 and 4-6. What is less known, is that the cycles differ from each other in a fixed manner. The days of the first cycle contain creations that are unique, separated, named and motionless (Straus). The days of the second cycle contain groups of multiple, unnamed, moving creations: stars, fish, etc. By arranging the six days in a table containing two columns, the two cycles, and three rows, the paired days, you get a visual representation of the structure underlying the six days of creation. Each individual day is a function of the intersection of two planning lines, its column and its row. “Reading” the text according to this structure reveals the underlying metaphysics of the creation.</p>
<p>7] <strong>How does your approach differ from the literary approaches to Bible and Mishnah that are being produced by Machon Herzog? </strong><br />
My specific focus is on the division into the structural literary units and the additional meanings that are made available by the identification of these larger units.</p>

				<p>Interviews with Chief Rabbi di Segni  from January 12, and 14.</p>
<blockquote><p>In an interview with Reuters ahead of this Sunday&#8217;s visit, Rabbi Riccardo di Segni also said he hoped the event would help combat hostility towards the Jewish world and intolerance of any religion.<br />
<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2010/01/14/romes-chief-rabbi-says-only-god-can-judge-pius-xii-on-holocaustEN"><br />
INTERVIEW &#8211; Only God can judge Pius XII on Jews &#8211; chief rabbi</a><br />
By Philip Pullella<br />
ROME (Reuters) &#8211; Only God can judge whether wartime Pope Pius XII did enough to save Jews and whether he should have spoken out more forcefully against the Holocaust, the rabbi who will host Pope Benedict first visit to Rome&#8217;s synagogue said.</p>
<p>Di Segni was asked about a Vatican official who defended Pius &#8212; who became pope on the eve of World War Two &#8212; from accusations he turned a blind eye to the Holocaust.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it can be morally dangerous and, religiously speaking, dangerous to say that the will of God is to be silent and not to say a word in front of the suffering of the people,&#8221; Di Segni said, speaking in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;So let us be careful and let us not (look for) a way of absolving people. I think only God may understand if people have done His will righteously, not us,&#8221; he said.&#8221;Religion now has a tremendous responsibility in bringing either war or peace to the world. So a signal of peace and friendship starting here from Rome could be very important,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Jews we want to say very strongly that any kind of hatred against difference, and not only against the Jews, has to be banned, has to be condemned,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another Interview in Catholic News Service</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000121.htm"><strong>Rome</strong><strong> rabbi says pope&#8217;s visit shows commitment to dialogue</strong></a><br />
Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, the chief rabbi, told <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/">Catholic News Service</a> there is &#8220;a solid basis&#8221; for positive relations, but &#8220;with a storm every now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Times have changed,&#8221; the rabbi said. &#8220;Many things have been achieved; other things still need to be done. The path, the Jewish-Catholic encounter, is terribly complicated. It is not a smooth road leading onward, but it is one continually filled with stumbling blocks. The visit of a pope to the synagogue should demonstrate that beyond the stumbling blocks there is a substantial desire to communicate with each other and resolve problems.&#8221;<br />
As is often the case, he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s hardest to establish good relations with the person closest to you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/135563">Side point on Bnei Akiva</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bnei Akiva’s local representatives said they decided to participate after hesitation and followed the advice of Rome&#8217;s Chief Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, who said that the visit was a sign that Pope Benedict wanted to &#8220;continue the dialogue.” He advised Bnei Akiva that the pope should be “respected as a king.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni (1949-) the current chief rabbi of Rome offers a unique take on the dialogue. He assumes that both sides accept exclusivism, so to go forward we have to affirm pluralism. Ever the gadfly, di Segni writes that the Jewish tradition follows the exclusivist and anti-Christian counter-gospel narrative of <a href="http:///jewishchristianlit.com/Topics/JewishJesus/toledoth.html"><em>Toldot Yeshu</em>,</a>  on which he wrote his doctorate <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16319665">and then published as a book.</a> For di Segni, Christians must recognize that the derogatory exclusivism <em>Toldot Yeshu</em> is the Jewish tradition, and this corresponds to the anti-Jewish narrative of traditional Christianity. He ponders that the Christian Trinity may actually be idolatry and violates the Noahite law that requires monotheism. If Christians violate this law, according to deSegni, they will not find salvation and are, furthermore, deserving of death in this world.</p>
<p>Noahite laws may be incumbent on gentiles as a form of general revelation but, Segni asks, if we took that seriously then wouldn’t we would have to be missionizing for these laws? So too, Christians if they should take their own faith seriously, should advocate missionizing.  Rabbi de Segni proposes therefore that both sides call a moratorium on truth claims and missionizing. It is not that either side should actually give up their truth claims, or their exclusivism, or to stop hoping for the conversion of the other, but simply a practical moratorium, a practical pluralism.</p>
<blockquote><p>The real problem is not so much the Church’s conviction of the necessity for the Jews to be saved by means of Jesus. The real issue is what is done with that conviction. If we were to apply the system of Noahide laws to the latter, we would have to do everything possible in order that the Noahides observe them—including the law dealing with the prohibition against worship of other gods. Each person would have to become a missionary of the pure faith…</p>
<p>On the Jewish side, this movement would have to be matched by an affirmation of the principle that faith in Jesus (understood: on the part of Christians, not Jews ) is not incompatible with the worship of the one and only God. This is a principle which has been accepted in authoritative traditions within Judaism, but which would have to become more prevalent and accepted by the majority. From this would have to follow, on the part of Jews, a greater understanding of Christian Spirituality.</p>
<p>Moses Maimonides, in the rules he gives for kings in his treatise (Chapter 11), after having denounced the invalidity of faith in Jesus, nevertheless formulated an interpretation of the providential significance of the spread of Christianity, “to prepare the road for the king-Messiah, and to help the whole world become accustomed to serving God together, as it is said, ‘At that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord’” (Zeph. 3:9).</p>
<p>Perhaps the parallel suggests the solution, which cannot be immediate but eschatological. Each of us has the right to hope that the other will acknowledge that there is true faith in us, but we allow for that to unfold over a long period, which is beyond our control.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sidic.org/en/DocOnLineView.asp?class=Doc00047">Read full version here</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi De Segni argues that we keep our particular truth claims but suspend acting on them until the end time. Since we have no common ground for discussion if we put our truth claims first, let us avoid the question and deal with ethics and practical matters.He frames questions as an exclusivist and then answers as a pluralist. Unlike other thinkers, De Segni values diversity over dignity, he emphasizes religious exclusivism and prejudice and then calls for charity.</p>
<p>Rabbi de Segni does work toward theological charity by building on Rabbi Yaakov Emden’s acceptance of Jesus as a great teacher who did not want to harm Judaism, and therefore legitimate for the gentiles since</p>
<p>In the end what counts is human responsibility. In the human realm, both faiths are called by God to work in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As he left the ark, Noah received the assurance that humanity would never again be entirely destroyed by God.</em> Now, however this risk still exists—not destruction by a divine hand, but by a human hand with no guarantees other than our own responsibility, which we (especially as religious) cannot escape. Commitments and facts must come before forms and ceremonies. This is the authentic message of the prophets, which we recognize as a common source, and the comfort promised by the divine mercy will recall once more the waters of Noah, no longer as a sign of destruction, but as a sign of protections. <strong><em>As the prophet Isaiah says (54:9): “This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>di Segni sates that there is no need for Jews to change their current prayer because they have already been censored, but he claims that they were self-censored. </p>
<blockquote><p> Jewish prayers have already been self-censored, centuries ago,&#8221; Di Segni informed the prelate in a communiqué. &#8220;What has been brought to our attention once more is a history of polemics which goes back thousands of years, concerning which some clarifications are in order. Anyone can hear for themselves the prayers which Jews recite today, and they can easily be verified, even in translation,&#8221; Di Segni emphasized. &#8220;The essential fact,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is that today no reference to Christians exists in our prayers, which, among other things, have been the object of repeated interventions of censoring and self-censoring. The Hebrew texts were changed centuries ago.<br />
<a href="http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/themes-in-todays-dialogue/good-friday-prayer/468-messaggero-08mar9">full version here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Di Segni thinks that dialogue is important but he does not think that <a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-9149?l=english">Judaism can change through dialogue.</a> &#8220;There has been notable theological progress in Christian theology&#8217;s view of Judaism”  However, &#8220;reciprocity at the theological level does not exist,&#8221; the rabbi said. &#8220;Among politicians there can be discussions that lead to a solution, not so among theologians.&#8221; &#8220;Christianity is born from Judaism and, with notable efforts, can introduce elements of Jewish spirituality,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The contrary is not possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Side Point: <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143045.html">Rabbi David Rosen in Haaratz</a> on the poor behavior of Jews toward the Vatican.</p>
<blockquote><p>Israel&#8217;s behavior toward the Vatican over the past 15 years has been &#8220;outrageous,&#8221; one of the figures behind the 1994 establishment of diplomatic relations between Jerusalem and Vatican City told Haaretz last week. &#8220;Any [other] country would have threatened to withdraw its ambassador long ago over Israel&#8217;s failure to honor agreements,&#8221; Rabbi David Rosen said.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Once upon a time when Prof Twersky of Harvard was holding conferences on the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, someone commented to me that we need conferences on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, centuries. There is a sense that much would be gained if you put those that work on Kabbalah and those that work on late midrash in a room together, new connections would be found.  Some have noted in my Zohar review the passing references to Philo of Alexandria and Shiite thought.  What I could not include in the Forward review is any discussion of the use of extended narrative of late antiquity in these Zohar volumes such as the role of Sefer Hayashar &#8211;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Jerahmeel"> Chronicle of Yerachmiel </a>nor the history of the traditions of Moses as king and warrior in Ethiopia from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Moses">Chronicle of Moses</a>. Nor did I mention the alchemy. Much of this was already noted by Moses Gaster, Louis Ginzburg, Adolphe Jellinek and others.</p>
<p>What the Pritzker edition lacks is any greater context than early Andalusian Kabbalah. When Midrash is added to the footnotes it is from CD-Rom and Margaliot&#8217;s comments on the Zohar not as an actual useful comparison.  Or when there is a footnote to the messianic battles of <a href="http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/secretssby.htm">Nistarot of Rabbi Shimon</a> &#8211; the footnote does not make one aware of the half a dozen different versions composed over 500 years  or which version does the Zohar seem to know. The version in Jellinek? the one edited by Bernard Lewis? Nor are the sources in Ashkenaz material sufficiently noted.</p>
<p>Yet,  there are the connections that allude almost anyone in Jewish studies. For example, At this year&#8217;s SBL there was a paper on The Shepard of Hermes and thanks to<a href="http://mystical-politics.blogspot.com/2009/11/more-great-sbl-sessions-on-mysticism.html"> a write up on Mystical Politics</a>, there was a tentative connection to the Kabbalah.</p>
<blockquote><p>The third paper in the session was &#8220;The Tower as Divine Body: Visions and Theurgy in the Shepherd of Hermas,&#8221; presented by Franklin Trammell. The abstract of his paper reads:</p>
<p>Behind some of the visions and teachings in the Shepherd of Hermas lies the notion of a direct correspondence between the heart of the righteous and the androgynous divine body. This body is presented by Hermas as a sevenfold Tower that is in the process of being (re)built by (re)incorporating the feminine Ecclesia. Members of the Ecclesia, who are pure of heart, are clothed with twelve virgins and receive the seal of the Son of God, representing the female and male aspects of the body. They then affect the reintegration of this female aspect, being built into the eschatological Tower as a part of her. Hermas’ law of purity therefore plays an incredibly important theurgic role. In identifying the Tower with the Ecclesia, itself implicitly assimilated in the text to Sophia, the author portrays those who do not sin after baptism as participating in the (re)unification of pre-existent Wisdom. It is this process along with elements related to it that shares affinities with later Jewish mystical sources.</p>
<p>I found this talk fascinating, especially since I&#8217;ve never read the Shepherd of Hermas. I found particularly interesting the possible connections to Sefer ha-Bahir that he mentioned.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is the Shepard of Hermes?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shepherd_of_Hermas">From wiki</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shepherd_of_Hermas"><strong><em>The Shepherd of Hermas</em></strong> </a>(sometimes just called <strong><em>The Shepherd</em></strong>) is a Christian literary work of the second century, considered a valuable book by many Christians, and considered canonical scripture by some of the early Church fathers. The Shepherd had great authority in the second and third centuries.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd.html">text </a>and an<a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/shepherd.html"> Intro.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Shlomo Pines and other have noted the early references to Kabbalistic esotericsm in Patristics. But few look to works to books left out of Patristics like the Shepard of Hermes. Theses books give  insight into the thought of centuries like the second century, where we know little of the rabbinic worldview outside of the Tannaic works.</p>

				<p>An interesting find on the consistently superb blog <a href="http://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2010/01/crits-etc.html">Mirror of Justice,</a> written by two dozen law professors teaching at Catholic law schools.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Cambridge professor of theology,  Denys Turner, has noted &#8220;in much continental philosophy, from Heidegger to Levinas and Derrida, it is  acknowledged, with varying degrees of unease at having to concede the point, that the predicaments of our culture have an ineradicably <em>theological</em> character.&#8221; Back in 2004, Paul Griffiths made a similar point in a <em>First Things </em>essay, titled &#8220;Christ and Critical Theory,&#8221; which explores the Christian yearning of the likes of Lyotard, Badio, Eagleton (then a disaffected post-marxist), and Zizek.</p>
<p>If one takes the Crits to be involved with a philosophical engagement with difference, then their connection to a form of Christianity has been noted by theologians for some time. Points of contact exist between apophatic religion and the philosophical concern for difference, religious skepticism, and lived experience. Apophaticism is a <em>via negativa</em> approach to the divine where God is nameless because, in the words of Meister Eckhardt, &#8220;no one can say anything or understand anything about him.&#8221; The Crits, in their veneration of difference, negate the hegemonic traditions, thus leaving a space for apophasia, since positive namings of God are a part of the negated tradition.</p>
<p>What remains paramount for the Crits is experience. The lived experience of moral sentiments substitute for rational discourse, since such discourse is viewed as hopelessly rooted in authoritative traditions of moral reason that must be de-centered. Some, such as de Lubac, Balthasar, (and recently Pickstock and Millbank), see a genealogy for this in Ockham&#8217;s nominalism&#8211;the separation of language from reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>What would any of this mean for Judaism? Can any of this turn be used to create an ethical turn and moral sentiments toward love, fear, hospitality, and engaging the other?</p>
