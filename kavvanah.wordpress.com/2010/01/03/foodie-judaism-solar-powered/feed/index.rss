					<description><![CDATA[From what little I know about Narrative Medicine (talking with Bertie Bregman a bit about it; he was into it in med school and afterwards), I don&#039;t really see what &quot;accepting&quot; it means, or why it would affect rabbis.

As for the foodie thing, my wife was a foodie for a long time.  Now she&#039;s a cook.  As a pro, she feels that she&#039;s no longer a foodie by definition.  I think institutions like CKCA and the more extended program in J&#039;lem are a response to the foodie focus.  In my wife&#039;s class in the professional program, there were 5 men and 5 women.  The men were mostly already in the field, and were looking for some better training.  The women, except for Debbie, were not looking to become professionals, only better/more confident home cooks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1] I should have mentioned  &quot;Britain&#039;s chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks has called for this week&#039;s Sabbath to be devoted to the environment, ahead of the climate talks due to be held next week in Copenhagen.

Sacks has asked that this Sabbath, from sundown Friday until Saturday night, be focused environmental issues and has urged Jews across the U.K. to pray for sustainable habits of consumption and energy use. &quot;

2] the molecular gastronomy date has been changed to Jan 23rd.

3] The narrative medicine change will occur whether they like it or not.  Orthodox not too long ago did not know anything about medicine and medical halakhah was not constructed yet- and look what happened.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Teaneck is where they serve Cranberry Kugel &#038; Deli Roll (unironically).

Food serves an important purpose, in creating a cultural framework of giving a common language of the Orthodox. As Lichtenstein points out, &quot;learning&quot; and lomdus create a common language for people who otherwise might not have anything in common religiously. Being a Kosher foodie is an alternative language, especially in communities where people haven&#039;t picked up a Gemara in 10 years. As i once remarked about my Mother-in-Law&#039;s (religiously diverse) family, they like to talk about Music, Family and Food (as they are safe topics that do not cause conflict). 

Additionally it&#039;s easier to be a fineshmecker about food than clothing or travel which gets more expensive. Even people making less money can be foodies, if they want to invest the time and effort.

It&#039;s also possible to be into Heimish Cholent (with real kishke), eating herring with your fingers on Kichel and into Kosher elk and genuine Indian food. It&#039;s shows a morde developed palate.

On an unrelated note, Baalei Teshuva claim that most of the developments in food sophistication within the Orthodox communities come from Baalei Teshuva who cannot deal with what&#039;s served within Orthodoxy.

Lastly, in order to accept Narrative Medicine, Rabbis would have to reliquish their positions as Experts on Medical Halakha and focus on the experience of being sick, where they have no special expertise. Personally, I don&#039;t see this happening.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[torahumaddachic,

How do you think that narrative medicine will change the approach to Jewish medical ethics?
What would narrative medicine reject in the current approach?
 
And FYI

As guest chef at Solo NYC, sister restaurant to New York City´s famous Prime Grill, he will prepare an exclusive culinary adventure utilizing the techniques of Molecular Gastronomy, also known as New Cuisine and &quot;Avant-Garde Cuisine.&quot;

The Kosher Wine Society will contribute a truly special selection of wines to provide the perfect accompaniment to Chef Eli´s exciting menu. 

Meet Chef Eli in person and join us for this truly exotic food and wine pairing dinner.

					<description><![CDATA[the foodie process of differentiation is already playing itself out at the shabbos tables of Washington Heights. I can see two distinct groups: one which prefers zomicks, chicken breasts w duck sauce, deli roll, and taco salad; and a separate (socially at least) group- although there must be some overlap otherwise we wouldnt be invited to those meals to see the food variations in the first place- and a second group of CSA/locavore produce, artisanal bread, and a sneering contempt for onion soup mix. 
and, for what its worth, what happens when orthodox locavores like myself become doctors with a keen interest in narrative medicine?]]></description>

On the happier issue of foodie Judaism. I once tried kibbitzing my way through this topic. I would never have thought that Orthodox Jews would pay up for chemistry. Yuppiefication marches on.
