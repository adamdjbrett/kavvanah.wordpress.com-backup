LOL. No, it is not important whether the people are conscious of the categories. This is a sociological exercise: based on observed behavior, what can we say about where these people fit in best?

I think that while Open Orthodoxy strongly leans towards Liberal Secularism, generally, the rest of the Orthodox do not. However, before lumping everyone mostly into the Civil Religion sphere, and arguing why, let me just point out what I believe is obvious. This taxonomy is not about how religion is experienced, nor about how religious enclaves culturally present themselves, but rather about how religion interfaces with official or general public life.

There were (and still are) those for whom civil religion is their religion. That model was predominant in Judaism of the 1950s, and is indeed passé. However, as far as how we see or wish to see society in general evolve, I would say that except for Open Orthodoxy and the most insular Chassidim, all other Orthodox Jews fall into the Civil Religion category, except as relating to Israel, as the blog owner pointed out.

Let me show a few examples: Chabad erecting menorot in public squares. They are not content with large menorot in the Batei Chabad front yards and on the roof tops of their mitzvah tanks, but want menorot even on the lawn of important public institutions. Another, more meaningful example: across the board Orthodox opposition to homosexual marriage. It is noteworthy that even some very yeshivish and very chassidic activists recently got into that, too, as could be seen in the debates leading up to the latest vote in New Jersey. And of course, there is a strong feeling among most Orthodox in favor of school vouchers. The more left wing MO also like to demonstrate in favor of causes, such as workers&#039; immigrants&#039; and refugees&#039; rights, and they language is often unmistakably religious.

					<description><![CDATA[You are asking a question of how people view themselves within the context of these categories. The problem is that most Orthodox Jews, including many in leadership positions, lack the background in political theory to even understand your post let alone to be able to answer it for themselves.  

I would add a wrinkle into the mix. Where does one draw the line, to use Hannah Arendt, between the political and social spheres? Someone like me could end up in different categories depending on where you draw the line. I may not like Ayn Rand’s social philosophy, but I am a political libertarian, who wants the government out of all things that do not involve people causing other people direct physical harm. Someone like me would be trying to take things like school and health care and take them from the political to the social sphere and I believe in a strong social sphere with a civic religion. I admire people like Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and his advocacy for a strong shared social space with the religious beliefs that span the spectrum of a multicultural society. I support such a civic religion, but would not have the government play any direct role.]]></description>
