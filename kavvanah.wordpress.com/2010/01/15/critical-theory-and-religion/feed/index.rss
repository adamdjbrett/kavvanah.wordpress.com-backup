					<description><![CDATA[Yes, but it seems to have reached its apotheosis in MO. Think about valorizing as its spiritual figurehead a person who was an unabashed elitist who barely wrote about community and is esteemed for having some complicated and rather arcane inner spiritual life. 

What other streams of Orthodoxy have gone down this path to such an extent?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe there is already the genesis of a de-centered phenomenology of halakaha in Orthodoxy were lay people stop trying to break into the interpretive fortress of the learned class  (something that people attempted to do unsuccessfully by starting to write aggadic midrash again) and instead speak of the sentiments involved in performance/nonperformance of mitzvot. 

The problem is that in the context of American culture this tends to  turn inward rather than a communal turn toward the other. 

It also seems that Modern Orthodoxy in its quest to be modern has so privatized religious life that its members can scarcely articulate an thick idea of communal experience.]]></description>

I have always liked the way Vatimo put it.
Medievals asked: what effect did it have? 
Moderns asked: What does it mean to me? 
post-moderns ask: what does it say?
If moderns could make Sartre, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Hegel as part of Orthodoxy, then Derrida, Habermas, and Ricoeur, and Vattimo should not be any harder.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been arguing for a long time that post-moderism is no more or less hospitable to Orthodox Judaism than the modernism upon which Torah UMaddah is based.

One way that I like to present the issue is as follows.
The challenge of modernity was, &quot;Why put on Teffilin when you get up in the morning.&quot;
The challenge of post-modernity is &quot;Why get out of bed at all?&quot;
Since we seem to get out of bed anyways, putting on Teffilin doesnt seem so unreasonable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You give two options: nominalism and constructivism.  And use language of  &quot;difficult to sell&quot; or compelling. Are we talking sociologically? psychologically? What are we trying to overcome in the sell?
Post-moderns would find the Rawls and Freud type arguments wanting and none compelling- they are too real, not soft enough, not theological enough.
The Sabian story lasted for centuries with many embellishments and lasted until Robinson Smith in the 19th century.  I think Marc Angel uses a version of it to say that Torah is rational compared to the Sabian Haredim.
I do not think a post-modern reading of Sinai would ever yield a nominal metaphor, that is very modern.
Apophasism, Minimal Theology, Sinai without Being would probably be the way the people mentioned in the post would deal with a historical dogma.
Turner would look to its effect on the person as part of spirituality, a Sinai spirituality that is not a story but a presence in our lives.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The social contract tradition reads Kant&#039;s ethical theory in a Rawlsian way. The little I know about Leibowitz, he uses Kant as a proof text of sorts in praise of the glories of heteronomy, the starry heavens above and all of that, without any understanding of a transcendental deduction. He thinks the facticity of the rules is reason enough. 

For a pattern or structure to be primary it has to answer the question why this particular pattern and not some other. It could be, as in the case of Rawls, a justification that each of the premises that constitute the original position are plausible if we are going to try to work out what are the principles of morality. In the case of Freud there is some important congruence between the story of the primal horde and the resolution of the Oedipal complex. The parricide story is of particular significance, because a similar event occurs in the life of each individual; nothing to do with morality. Robert Paul tries to show, I think successfully, that there is a congruence between the Freud story and the chumash narrative, the parricide being that of Pharaoh. 

What&#039;s wrong with the Sabian story is that once it was shown to be a fiction somehow it couldn&#039;t function in the way that it was intended, the proof being that in fact this story was never taken up again or embellished.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[correction...sorry...&#039;first&#039; and &#039;second&#039; in the second paragraph of my first comment  should be exchanged. 

Adding to that example...we find almost the same controversy in the philosophy of mathematics. Platonism is easy to understand and does justice to our feeling that mathematics corresponds to some fact but it becomes very difficult to understand how we gain access to this mysterious world of numbers. Nominalism doesn&#039;t account for our feeling that mathematics is more than a useful way of talking.  The possibility of a middle way, of a reduction of numbers to sets and the establishment of a set theory without paradoxes and after Godel is way beyond my competence, but is the central issue which in turn has had enormous consequences for logic.]]></description>

I will think about your answer before replying. But is the sort of thing that you envision like Maimonides construction of the idea of the magical Sabians, we are the non-Sabians? 
or are you seeking a return to a Leibowitz Kantian view of Revelation? 
You examples of Rawls and Freud, makes me think that you would like the construction to be ethically motivated more than &quot;historic&quot; or monotheistic .]]></description>
