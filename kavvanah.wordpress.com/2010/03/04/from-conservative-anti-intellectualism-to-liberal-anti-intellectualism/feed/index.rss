					<description><![CDATA[Intellectualism certainly is not being versed in the modern philosophy, etc. what is &quot;intellectualism&quot;?

For example an average American knows a lot about baseball and spends time on it. Does it make him an intellectual? I think it does. In other words it is about being curious about something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem in my opinion is less anti -intellectualism than time. No one has the time to study new philosophers to any degree of depth. So after the superficial summary is put out and some analogy is established, that&#039;s about it...onto the next hot thing. 

It&#039;s the same with theologians who offer facile analogies to modern physics. These cliff notes do more harm than good.

In yeshiva we are all taught not to run, but to stay on the daf until the sugya is laid out with some clarity. The same here. In post modern philosophy especially the European variety, bekius is the enemy of understanding. 

One solution is never to refer to a proper name as if the doctrine associated with that name is  obvious. I do the same and I associate my own obscurantism with that flaw.]]></description>
