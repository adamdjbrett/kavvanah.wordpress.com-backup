					<description><![CDATA[1) My grandfather, ob&quot;m, grew up in South Germany and graduated from the Wurzberg Teachers&#039; Seminary founded by R. Bamberger. I&#039;ve recently become very interested in Bavarian Jewish life, especially as a subaltern to the Berlin and Frankfurt schools that get so much attention.

2) Regarding the &quot;we put the fun in fundamentalism&quot; bit, I wrote about a tailgate party that I hosted here:

					<description><![CDATA[I was saying that Tucker is really gesturing towards a more Hegelian notion of Sittlichkeit. Great. I am all there. But I do not see how we then preserve the sense that you OUGHT to keep shabbat. Sure, if Seth Schwartz finds me a papyrus saying that the Palestinian folks in Roman times kept shabbat, that was their mode of ethical life. But right now most Jews do not do so, and Tucker wants us to get rid of sectarianism too. This is a great evolution which I believe culminates in Spirit (last I checked).  Cannot wait to see the wholly secularized vaguely protestant MO of the future. 

In terms of neo kantian Halacha limiting us to a very cloistered set of reasons I think that this is not a problem. We need only look at Kant&#039;s anthropology where he tells us how to make a meal. Or else at his Third Critique, where the beauty of the arts is affirmed as (as if) teleological. The point is I agree with you. The space of reasons for self determining subjects is as wide as the starry sky above me, and for me more dizzying and awe inspiring.  I am sure others can empathize. If MOs chose not to be interested in much beyond the making meals part, it does not speak to a deficiency in Kant as much as in them. What can we say about someone who closes her eyes to the incredible possibilities of human life as a self determining subject in a society? Nebach.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[chakira...the big problem MO find in halacha are not the the rules or their endless specification , but in the inablity to find justifications  for any values outside of halacha, so that  most human cultural activities are then justified by philistine reasons like parnassah. 

 I think we can value activities not specified by halacha even within a Kantian framework. Kant allows for imperfect duties and acts of supererogation. But most importantly we have to give up a teleological maximizing ethic where if being frum is good, being even frummer is better. I took a stab at this on XGH (3/11).

I agree with you once you get past rules defining practises and institutions you leave Orthodoxy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your synopsis of Ethan Tucker&#039;s comments is interesting.  The point/s is one of continuing concern as we worry about the tension between making Torah available and applicable vs. bending it to the unspoken will of the contemporary community.  Rav Hirsch&#039;s position was an extreme dictated by the circumstances only.  Contrast that to the N&#039;tziv&#039;s position in Meishiv D&#039;var.

Michael, I don&#039;t think he meant that the rav in SF invented the beginner&#039;s service.  I think he was simply noting it&#039;s use.

Actually, I don&#039;t see that as unusual or an &#039;Aish&#039; thing.  The beginner&#039;s service has been around a long time.  Is there a reason we shouldn&#039;t hold the door open for people who may be looking for the entrance?  I don&#039;t see that as lacking in substance.  I see that as maybe leading to greater substance.

I can&#039;t do Superbowl parties, myself.  But maybe that is why I&#039;m not drawing crowds into the beit midrash?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If we are against formalist kantian halacha, then why not go full bore Hegelian and advocate halacha as a notion of sittlichkeit without extraneous statements about ought? There is even a Hazalic concept of going to see what people do. Thats it. 

I do not know how we would be keeping shabbat at that point, but I am not the one advocating the slightly awkward middle position that wants a bit of sittlichkeit and a bit of legislation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re GPATS graduates and the Maharat program: I- and many of my friends, from the informal straw polling I&#039;ve done- would do Hadar if we didn&#039;t have other compelling career goals.
