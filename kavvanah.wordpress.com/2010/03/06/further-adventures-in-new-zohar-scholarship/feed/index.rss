					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading &quot;Mystic Tales from the Zohar&quot; by Wineman and find it very sophisticated. He takes a literary, contextual approach to the Zohar selections he offers and does a fine. well-thought-out job. It works best when you look at the original beforehand then see his take on it. Your thoughts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having read this article I must register my severe disappointment. What is Yisraeli doing here? For me I got a reassertion of internalist modes of reading Jewish texts. OK, I read that in Boyarin, Intertextuality. I get it.
What I did not get was anything internal to the phenomenon. For me the phenomenon must be defined by a given problem and here it is a problem of immanentization. How did Mommy migrate down from Binah to Shekhinah? What theological problems neccesitate the constant, unending movement of immanentization? Brient, Harries, Blumenberg and others struggle to answer this question. For Yisraeli it is a non issue. Instead he notes that the immanentization happened and that Mommy and Daddy appear in sifrut Hazal. 

(I will give Yisraeli credit for noting the Stoic parallel. Had he read Marcus Aurelius he may have noted that the higher faculties in a person are also analogized to Gods.)]]></description>
