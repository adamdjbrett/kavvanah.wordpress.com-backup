					<description><![CDATA[Alan:  Thank you for referring to my article and  for your kind remarks. I think your placing the Rackman /Soloveitchik dispute  in the  context of legal theory is very well taken  and,  as you say,  adds an important  dimension to my article.  Perhaps  I ought to have sent it to you for comments  before I submitted it for publication! I welcome  commments  from bloggers who have read my article.]]></description>
