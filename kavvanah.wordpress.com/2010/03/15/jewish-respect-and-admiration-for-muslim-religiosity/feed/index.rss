					<description><![CDATA[We dont completely know. There was radical conversion to Islam of a large % of Jewish in the Ottomon empire and we dont have widespread concern and protest. We have more anger and rejection then kiruv or demographic concern.
I have always wondered why this was. 
For a full bibliography fro the Muslim side, see Marc David Baer, Honored by the Glory of Islam  (2007). He also has an article on Sufi versus non-Sufi as a medium of conversion. 
On the Jewish side you can start with the notes of Yosef Hacker, and the article of Leah BORNSTEIN-MAKOVETSKY, The Attitude of Jewish Scholars to Jewish Conversion to Islam and Christianity during the Last Century of the Ottoman Empire.
Someone upload an good article by Klorman about Yemen with a decent literature review.
