					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it was the timing of this opening.

But I plan on attending the show before it closes. David Smith is an old friend whom I have known since Chabad created a surprise Bar Mitzvah for him when he was a RISD student, way, way back when.

He is a born kabbalist (albeit possibly more Blakean than Lurianic) and I look forward to seeing his new art works.]]></description>
