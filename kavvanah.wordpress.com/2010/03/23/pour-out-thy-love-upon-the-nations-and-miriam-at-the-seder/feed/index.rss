					<description><![CDATA[These feminists must have really big seder plates, to add an orange, and a fish (and a bicycle).  Ramaz used to encourage a &quot;Matza of Hope&quot;, on a separate plate from the 3 (or 2), for Soviet Jewry.

Once or twice when I was a kid I dressed up as Eliyahu (well, a bathrobe - what did we all wear in class plays when playing Biblical figures?) , went out the back door, and came in the front at Shfoch Chamat&#039;cha.]]></description>

Go find the many articles on the topic. The commentaries are entirely Yudel Rosenberg and there are a few choice addition by Rosenberg to the text.
Shnayer Z.  Leiman &quot;Adventure of the Maharal of Prague in London: R. Yudl Rosenberg and the Golem of Prague.&quot;  Fourth annual lecture of the Victor J.Selmanowitz Chair of Jewish History.  New York: Graduate School of JewishStudies, Touro College, 2000. [reprinted in Tradition]
Avraham Benedict &quot;Hagadat Maharal o Aggadat Maharal&quot; Moriah 14 3-4 (1985) 102-113

The idea of a fifth cup goes back to the Rif and has a long genealogy woven between Kos shel Eliyahu and various millennial movements. . My comment was on the &quot;Shefah Ahavatecha&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question:  There is a haggadah in what used to be the common set/collection of Maharal&#039;s writings.  Some of the material is merely excerpted from G&#039;vurot, and N&#039;tivot, and the Drush for Shabbat Hagadol.

It also has two commentaries, Divrei N&#039;gidim and Lashon Limudim, which were &#039;published by...Y.Y. Rosenberg, rav of Tarla,...copied from a manuscript of...the son in law of [Maharal].

Are these commentaries the forgery that you are referring to?  Or is there another so-called &#039;haggadah of the Maharal&#039;?

Also, I&#039;m sure you know that the fifth cup idea was supported by Rav Kasher and Rav Goren, not relying on the Maharal necessarily.  Do you think they were mistaken, or are you and R. Golonkin et al merely saying that the Maharal never said any such thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s an article in the latest issue of Milin Havivin about the connections of Miriam to the Seder. It seems to me to be a bit of fishing for sources and emphasizing the tiny minority. Not that there&#039;s necessarily anything wrong with that.]]></description>
