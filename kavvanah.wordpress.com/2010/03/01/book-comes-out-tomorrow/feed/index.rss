					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/book-comes-out-tomorrow/#comment-671&quot;&gt;Yaakov Feldman&lt;/a&gt;.

I do not know any course or website. One learns to read academic Hebrew the same way one gets to Carnegie Hall....practice. If you did an Ulpan and got up to level Vav, then you had some practice. In my time in YU, back when 2 years of Hebrew was required, they got us up to daled-heh, so we could start with heh-vav afterward.  Sit down with 6-8 articles written by native Israelis and an Alcalay dictionary and practice.  I was also quite fond of Joseph, Asher. Milon le-munaḥim be-madae ha-ḥevrah veha-ruaḥ. A Dictionary of Terms in Social Sciences and Humanities 1974 50 pages, which I bought at the Hebrew U Akademon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I look forward to reading it! I&#039;d like to ask a somewhat tangential question though, since you&#039;re an academic. I&#039;m able to read classical Jewish texts (I guess it goes without saying) but I really need to struggle to comprehend monder, academic hebrew works. How does one learn to do that? Can you direct me to a book, website, course? Thanks. B&#039;hatlzlacha rabbah.]]></description>
