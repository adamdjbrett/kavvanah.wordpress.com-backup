<p>I had a medical virus this week and was ill so I did not post but people still showed up. No one emailed to to ask if I stopped blogging the way people did during autumn breaks. So this is good.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of posts after almost eight months.</strong></p>
<p>1] I post random clipped items that I read because people ask me what I find interesting on the web  They are almost always from blogs of other faiths or ethics. Now, there are new tools like “read something” to share articles but this seems to work fine. I tend to select lists. This is my cork board.</p>
<p>2] I post interfaith clippings of Jews or Jewish texts. These get steady hits and serve as a repository. These rarely get a publishable comment. (I don’t post the islamophobia and xenophobia.)</p>
<p>3] I post pieces on Jewish meditation, Zohar, and kabbalistic ritual. These are intermittent but always generate the most comments and the most personal emails.</p>
<p>4] I post long reviews of the most important theological works of the year. This has been the most surprisingly successful for determining if I have a book review to pitch to a journal and to determine if I have 1k or 8k words.  These are the works that usually don’t get reviewed on blogs because the book was too complex for this format.</p>
<p>5] Finally, I post sociological observations on the Orthodox community in comparison to the other faiths as it appears on my feed. These generate the most links on other blogs and the massive influx of temporary readers but are not my major concern. However, when I feel I have come up with something, then I do theme and variations for a while.</p>
<p>6] Every 2 months I look at the wide range of Jewish academic journals and download the pdfs. I do this to professionally keep up with the field but have not had time to comment on more than a few articles.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of the technical aspects of the blog</strong></p>
<p>a] I could arrange this in magazine format as five topics, wordpress allows that but this is working OK.</p>
<p>b] If anyone has any suggestions for widgets or plug-ins, then let me know. I have not found a good widget for finding old posts yet. The cloud does not yield a sufficient index.</p>
<p>c] I have gotten used to receiving my best discussions and comments by email. I did not think it would. On the other hand, phone calls are a bit much and I do not then have a printed record of the comments.</p>
<p>d] I have not upgraded yet for a memory increase to allow mp3s and video. I am debating if I want to do file hosting here or at itunes u channel.</p>
<p>e] I get the most hits on snow days. I get the least before Hag.</p>
<p>f] Only a handful of readers ever click through to links.</p>
<p>g] When you are kind enough to send me typos, I correct them in the text. I do not bother posting the list of typos.</p>
<p><strong>Any Suggestions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Book old and new</strong></p>
<p>I will be speaking and having a book signing at NYU-Bronfman Center this Monday April 26<sup>th</sup> at 6:30.</p>
<p>I will be speaking at DAVAR in Teaneck on MAY 8<sup>th</sup> after musaf, shalos seudot, and then book signing after havdalah.  Order book in advance at $48 and you can pick it up before shabbos.</p>
<p>Finally, my first volume had an orange color on top; I will make the second volume light blue, magenta, or green. But should I change the text at the bottom of the cover? Rambam hilkhot AZ had 4 font sizes and was attractive on the page. None of the standard Talmud editions for AZ have the same eye appeal.  Do any Rishonim have an attractive first page of AZ? Neither Meiri, Yeraim, nor anything by Mosad Harav Kook has better typography. Does it pay to switch? <strong>Should I keep the Rambam and just change title and color?</strong></p>

				<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1163329.html">From Haaretz- full version here</a></p>
<p>Tzvia Greenfield. Israel&#8217;s first Haredi female to be elected to the Knesset, she is a fierce critic of her own community&#8217;s attitudes to the peace process and modernity; describing the Haredi community as being &#8220;incapable of compromise.&#8221; Yet she still lives in it, a resident of the Jerusalem suburb of Har Nof.</p>
<p>Of course, her horizons are far broader than the narrow vista of ultra-Orthodoxy. The 62-year-old, who has a doctorate in political philosophy from the Hebrew University, was elected on behalf of Meretz last November. She advocates a two-State solution based closely on the pre-1967 War borders; a self-proclaimed egalitarian, she’s in favour of women rabbis and religious pluralism.</p>
<p>The mother-of-five, who sent her children to national religious high-schools and both her sons to the army, arrives as expected wearing a sheitel (one that looks like a sheitel) and a long dress.</p>
<p>She then speaks candidly about her prospects of influencing change: she is unsure that Israel&#8217;s left can be revived &#8211; she&#8217;s not sure they can awake secular Israel from its &#8220;slumber&#8221;- and feels compelled to channel change in her own back-yard, despite disillusionment about the trenchant positions of the Haredi world, which her Austrian &#8220;ultra-Orthodox Zionist parents&#8221; brought her into.</p>
<p>She describes the &#8220;haredization&#8221; of parts of Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh as &#8220;killing&#8221; those places: &#8220;Once they take over a community no one else can live in &#8211; like in some parts of Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh &#8211; that&#8217;s unacceptable. That is something people won&#8217;t tolerate because they want to live their lives. One neighbour cannot impinge on the other&#8217;s rights; it&#8217;s true the Haredi community doesn&#8217;t understand its task in a democracy. It believes when its population grows in a territory, the whole area should be governed by its rules.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;An essential part of adjustment is in being a minority; the problem is when they become a majority. They are already driving people out of Jerusalem and not just the secular &#8211; but the modern Orthodox; because they cannot tolerate this. If the Haredi community gets large enough we won&#8217;t see nice developments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her non-interventionist liberal instincts means she defends its right to promote a school curriculum that bares little resemblance to the national model: she believes a &#8220;balanced&#8221; approach is necessary in seeking to bring the Haredi world into the modern age, without assaulting its delicate nuances. &#8220;Interfering in questions of education is particularly sensitive and fragile,&#8221; she argues. &#8220;Thinking from all sides, I think society has to ensure Haredim aren&#8217;t poor. Despite Israeli society’s investment it&#8217;s a very poor community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can Meretz deliver change? &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. I think the left all over Europe and particularly Israel has severely failed on many assignments and I think the left should profoundly reconsider its goals and how it goes about them. To me after years of being a peace activist it&#8217;s a shameful situation and I think it&#8217;s unacceptable not to look at ourselves.</p>
<p>Q and A</p>
<p><strong>Bearing in mind you say some religious people have difficulty with compromise how would you like to see change stemming from the religious world?</strong></p>
<p>Religious people have difficulty grasping essential ideas like peace, compromise and accepting others. These are difficult issues and they&#8217;ve got to be worked out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing a book on the subject. I decided I had to write down what I think and that would be the best way to explain how one could retain ones religiosity and faithfulness to ones position and yet encourage profound changes.</p>
<p>I have one answer to your question. I think a religion ought to be concerned with human beings and not objects. Too often traditional religions have a great interest in objects and not enough in human beings. That has to be shifted completely. The emphasis and the concern should be entirely different and there are ways to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the demonstration of the human side of the Judaism has been lost?</strong></p>
<p>I think there is not enough concern about human beings, and I mean human beings in general, including non-Jews. As a religious person I believe that all human beings were created in the image of God.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve seen in Israel in the last thirty or forty years ever since the &#8217;67 War is a concern with land. That&#8217;s an object. It&#8217;s become the centre of attention for religious people and I think that&#8217;s a major mistake and I think that should be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you stand on issues of religious pluralism and the rights of all sects of Judaism to have equal funding with regards to conversion programs and education?</strong></p>
<p>Of course I support pluralism. People have to make their choices and decide what&#8217;s for them. There&#8217;s no way the state should direct on what or how they should do things. Every citizen should be a free subject to make his or her decisions without any input by the state whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>How would you, as a progressive Haredi, advocate it modernises its approach to self- governance?</strong></p>
<p>Education. Education is the answer to everything, The fact that it blocks general education to its community is part of the problem because they never really understand what is going on and make their own decision. I would try and allow these people to get education without breaking down the system altogether, without enforcing education on them in a way which cannot acceptable, not only for them, but even for me. I don?t believe in enforcing it brutally; it has to be done carefully.</p>
<p>The very fact it&#8217;s living in the modern world, is affecting it. We are talking about the younger generation that will make decisions about what they are doing. In both America and Israel.  They are re-evaluating the world that their parents have brought them into. We&#8217;re probably going to see changes in the next 20-30 years. After all, they do not want to be poor.</p>
<p>You hope that the secular and Haredi worlds can live side by side but at the moment even the modern Orthodox are getting annoyed with the Haredim as the recent riots in Beit Shemesh prove.</p>
<p>Once they take over a community no one else can live in &#8211; like in some parts of Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh &#8211; that&#8217;s unacceptable. That is something people won’t tolerate because they want to live their lives. One neighbor cannot impinge on the other&#8217;s rights; it&#8217;s true the Haredi community doesn&#8217;t understand its task in a democracy. It believes when its population grows in a territory the whole area should be governed by its rules.</p>
<p><strong>The Haredization of Jerusalem is already here &#8211; how can this situation be clawed back?</strong></p>
<p>The community is poor, uneducated and very militant &#8211; the combination is lethal. It will kill Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>How can the Haredi leadership recognise the need to modernise?</strong></p>
<p>There is one factor in favour of modernisation- poverty. Some of the leadership recognizes and is concerned by this. Although the politicians would recommend poverty should be paid for, the leaders have a deeper approach. Certain changes must occur. First women join professions. Later on some men join. Things will change. Young men will be encouraged to join colleges. Already now there are a couple of colleges where Haredi girls are accepted to law or commerce school.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the status of women in the Haredi world?</strong></p>
<p>The big issue here is a very delicate one. That is children. Large families thirty years ago was six children; now there&#8217;s 13 or 14 &#8211; from one wife. I believes the glorification of bringing as many children as possible is a definite way of ensuring women can&#8217;t bring their advantages into effect &#8211; subjugation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s inconceivable for a woman to say to her husband, &#8220;I won&#8217;t have more than three children&#8221; &#8211; a cause for divorce. Inconceivable and non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think there should be Orthodox female rabbis?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for it. I think if women want to serve as rabbis in religious function they should be given the right to do so. The issue of depriving women a religious position is part of deprivation of women from positions of power. Women don’t have equal rights in Judaism because they never had them in any field of life- a general result of subjugation.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a lack of state involvement in social issues?</strong></p>
<p>The state has been run by conservatives who don&#8217;t want equal rights for women, Arabs, anyone; any progressive left issues. They want to sabotage these things.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.collegecrunch.org/professors/the-20-most-brilliant-christian-professors/">This list</a> should give people a sense of what is considered academic religion today. I can quibble over some of the inclusions and I have my own favorites to add. While lists may be arbitrary or really a sense of misplaced concreteness in such a list but they are useful for keeping up on the field. the list includes both liberals and evangelicals and it has the leaders in questions of religion and science. While everyone should have read Peter Berger and know of Charles Taylor Robert George and Alvin Plantinga &#8211; the influence of many of the others cannot be underestimated. Knowing at least half of them is a good start for the pulse of popular academic theology.</p>
<p><em>The professors listed here are all “brilliant” in the original sense  of the word—they shine brightly among their peers as towering figures in  the academic world. In addition, they are all Christians who do not  hide their Christianity and see it as significantly impacting their  intellectual work.</em></p>
<p><em>We have limited this list to professors who teach in the  English-speaking world. A few listed here have officially retired or  moved on to other responsibilities, but in each case they keep close  ties to the academic world.</em></p>
<p>Peter Berger (1929-)</p>
<p>Professor Emeritus of Religion, Sociology and Theology at Boston  University, where he directs its Institute on Culture, Religion, and  World Affairs. A Lutheran, he studies the secularization of the West,  focusing especially on the rift between “ elite culture and the rest of  the population.” He sees American Christianity as a force for resisting  secularization: “In the U.S., unlike any Western European country, there  is enormous popular resistance to this trend [of secularization],  especially from evangelical Christians.” He has written numerous  influential books that have been widely translated. The University of  Munich and Notre Dame have awarded him honorary doctorates.</p>

<h3>Simon Conway Morris (1951-)</h3>
<p>Professor of Evolutionary Palaeobiology in the Earth Sciences  Department at Cambridge University. Praised by the late Stephen Jay  Gould for his fundamental insights into the Cambrian explosion, Conway  Morris ardently defends evolutionary theory in his book Life’s Solution:  Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe (Cambridge). At the same time,  he has no patience with atheists who use evolution to try to “prove”  atheism. Active with the Templeton Foundation, Conway Morris has become a  key critic of intelligent design. Conway Morris’s understanding of  evolution is deeply tinged with Neoplatonism. His favorite author is the  Christian apologist G. K. Chesterton.</p>

<p><strong> Louise S. Cowan (1916-)</strong></p>
<p>University Professor of English at the University of Dallas. She, as a  former dean, and her late physicist husband Donald, as president,  fundamentally transformed the University of Dallas’s curriculum,  advancing a generous Christian humanism. An author of books and numerous  articles, she is best known for her teaching and impact on students.  Now in her 90s, she continues to teach. As one recent student remarked,  “Dr. Cowan is a legend and a master at her craft. She is uplifting,  inspirational and brilliant. She is the reason that many teachers are  still teaching literature and loving it.”</p>

<p><strong>William Lane Craig (1949-)</strong></p>
<p>Research Professor of Philosophy at the Talbot School of Theology,  Biola University. With a doctorate in philosophy (under John Hick) and  another doctorate in theology (under Wolfhart Pannenberg), Craig is the  premier evangelical apologist of his generation. A consummate debater  who regularly debates atheists before university and (mega-)church  audiences, he is at the same time a top-flight and wide-ranging scholar  with a voluminous output that includes many books and articles. He has  made fundamental contributions in the study of God’s relation to time,  traditional arguments for God’s existence (especially the Kalam  cosmological argument), and divine and human freedom.</p>

<h3>Alvin Plantinga (1932-)</h3>
<p>John A. O’Brien Professor of Philosophy at the <a title="University  of Notre Dame" href="http://www.collegecrunch.org/school-profiles/indiana/university-of-notre-dame/">University  of Notre Dame</a>. After receiving his Ph.D. from Yale, Plantinga  taught at Calvin College. More than any other philosopher, Plantinga is  credited with the revival of Christian theism as topic of serious  inquiry within mainstream academic philosophy. In The Scandal of the  Evangelical Mind, Mark Noll cites this move in philosophy as the only  truly significant contribution of evangelicalism to the wider  intellectual culture. Plantinga has written several important books,  including God and Other Minds (Cornell), The Nature of Necessity  (Oxford), and his trilogy on proper function (Oxford).</p>

<h3>John Polkinghorne (1930-)</h3>
<p>Former President of Queen’s College at Cambridge University, where he  was also Professor of Mathematical Physics. Elected as a Fellow of the  Royal Society, he resigned his professorship in 1979 to pursue the  Anglican priesthood. As a priest, he became one of the leading voices  and teachers in the dialogue between science and religion, culminating  in his award in 2002 of the Templeton Prize. Polkinghorne “believes that  the universe is an ‘open’ and ‘flexible’ system, where patterns can be  seen to exist, but where ‘the providential aspect cannot be ruled out.’”  “His own faith has little to do with physics. It stems, instead, from a  more personal ‘encounter with Christ.’”</p>

<h3>Marilynne Robinson (1943-)</h3>
<p>Pulitzer Prize winning author (for Gilead) and permanent faculty  member of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop (University of Iowa). Her  non-fiction The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought trenchantly  critiques modern misconceptions that secular thinkers use to invalidate  Christian faith. Her 2009 Terry Lectureship at Yale, titled Absence of  Mind: The Dispelling of Inwardness from the Modern Myth of the Self,  expands on this critique. In a 2006 interview with The Christian  Century, she remarked, “I’d like to see mainline churches, collectively  and individually, remember and claim their profound histories and  cultures.”</p>

<h3>Henry “Fritz” Schaefer III (1944-)</h3>
<p>Graham Perdue Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Center for  Computational Chemistry at the University of Georgia. The inventor of  quantum computational chemistry, Schaefer has published over 1,000  journal articles and is one of the most widely cited chemists in the  world. Receiving his doctorate from Stanford, he was on faculty at Cal  Berkeley before taking his current position at Georgia. A constant  contender for the Nobel Prize, he has been persistently passed over for  membership in the prestigious U.S. National Academy of Sciences because  of his outspoken Christian views, skepticism of Darwinism, and support  of intelligent design.</p>

<h3>Charles Margrave Taylor (1931-)</h3>
<p>Emeritus Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at McGill  University, Canada. A Roman Catholic, Taylor is one of the premier  social and political thinkers of our time. His book Sources of Self,  according to Robert Hoffman, provides “a historical account of the  modernist protest against the disengaged and instrumental modes of  thought and action that arose when theistically grounded morality  crumbled.” It demonstrates Taylor’s thorough-going engagement with the  contemporary intellectual world. Taylor is the recipient of numerous  awards, including the Kyoto Prize (for arts and philosophy) and the  Templeton Prize (for progress in religion).</p>

<p>Blair Professor of Geosciences Emeritus at Princeton University.  Known for his genius at “seeing through rocks,” Suppe has received  numerous honors, including membership in the U.S. National Academy of  Sciences. A convert to Christianity later in life, Suppe has a passion  for missions. As a member of the American Scientific Affiliation, a  professional society of Christians focusing on the relation between  faith and science, he sees “significant parallels between Christian and  scientific knowing that lie at the very core of contingent epistemology.  Specifically, observation and interaction are fundamental to both  Christian and scientific knowledge.”</p>

				<p>Overheard snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Someone BT Yeshivish age 60 broke something valuable and they said:</p>
<p>&#8220;May it be a tikkun!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>My question is what happened to the traditional  &#8220;May it be a Kapparah!&#8221;??<br />
The traditional formula  is about the need to pay for one&#8217;s sins, there has to be an expiation by transferring the punishment onto the inanimate object.<br />
What does the new phrase mean? A tikkun is a positive act or something redemptive or restorative. Have we lost the sense of needing expiation for sins? Have we lost a sense that everyone has to pay dues or accept a certain amount of loss? Do we think everything we do has a positive force? Has the liberal language of tikkun olam finally become traditional? Thoughts?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Walter Brueggemann is the William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia<br />
He has devoted his life to a passionate exploration of Old Testament theology, with an emphasis on the relation between the Old Testament and the Christian canonical works, and the dynamics of Jewish-Christian interactions. He has published more than 59 books.</p>
<p>Brueggermann criticizes Brevards Childs as being too Christian and not pluralistic enough (Jon Levenson in turn uses the same arguments on Brueggermann). Walter Brueggemann is the standard mainline Protestant approach. He is the Reverend Lovejoy not the Ned Flanders. He is the standard approach now in seminaries that locating meaning in Documentary History is so 19th century skepticism and positivism, on the other hand he rejects fundamentalism or apologetics as anti-intellectual and repressive. <strong>Does he have anything to teach about moving beyond the false dichotomy? </strong><br />
He thinks history removes the theological sense of the text. We lose God and Sinai with criticism. We also cannot create an ethical approach with historical criticism. He is also willing to question parts of historical criticism. But on the other hand, he questions the fundamentalist approach as more concerned with external dogma and affirming an external event rather than accepting the revelation of the text. </p>
<blockquote><p>Passages from: Brueggemann, Walter. Theology of the Old Testament: Testimony, Dispute, Advocacy. Fortress Press: Minneapolis, 1997. (pp.726-29) Old Testament Theology in Relation to Historical Criticism</p>
<p>No doubt Brevard Childs is correct in his contention that the relationship between Old Testament theology and historical criticism is of crucial importance to any advance in Old Testament theology. Thus I take it as a truism that Old Testament theological interpretation must be seriously engaged with criticism, and any serious student of Old Testament theology cannot retreat into a “safe” fideism because he or she fears the results of critical inquiry.</p>
<p>The conclusion to which I am drawn is that the enormous apparatus of high historical criticism that reached its zenith in the nineteenth century and continued its dominance well into the twentieth century is not, in the first instant, of primary relevance to theological exposition at the end of the twentieth century. By such a conclusion, I do not intend any appeal to an anti-intellectual fideism; I appeal rather to criticism that is congruent in the two ways suggested. In drawing this conclusion, I only reflect what in practice has turned out to be the case for a great number of responsible scholars at the present moment, namely, that scholars have moved well beyond the critical categories that have come to represent historical criticism.</p>
<p>In my judgment, historical criticism (by which I shall refer to the entire Enlightenment enterprise that came to be associated with Julius Wellhausen and that now seems to reappear as neo-Wellhausianism) was committed to a Cartesian program that was hostile (in effect if not in intention) to the main theological claims of the text. </p>
<p>Thus what is required in a new, antipositivistic intellectual climate is a criticism that is not thinly positivistic, but that is open to the density of social and rhetorical processes that generate social reality beyond our “realism.”<br />
I suggest that in a new settlement still to be worked out between criticism and interpretation</p>
<p>     Serious energy needs to be given to discern what of the older historical criticism is to be retained and how it is to be used. There is much in the history of the literature and perhaps in the history of religion that still needs to be valued, even though almost every old “consensus” opinion is now under heavy assault. The challenge in retaining learning from the older historical criticism is to do so without a hidden commitment to the theological skepticism that seemed endlessly to accompany that criticism, but was not a necessary part of a critical perspective. There may be a place for skepticism, but it should be explicit along with its grounds, and not surreptitiously taken along with critical judgment.</p>
<p><strong>The real issue in the relationship between interpretation and criticism is to be aware that fideism and skepticism are twin temptations, and that criticism is an effort to be thoughtful in a way that does not permit fideism and that does not require skepticism.</strong> In much “scientific” study of the Old Testament, it is generally assumed that skepticism is much more intellectually respectable than is fideism. With the demise of positivism, that unstated but widespread assumption might well be reconsidered. Skepticism, often voiced as hostility to theological claim, is in fact not a given element in responsible intellectual inquiry. What passes for uncommitted objectivity in Old Testament study, moreover, is often a thinly veiled personal hostility to religious authority, which is displaced on the interpretive task as though such hostility is an intellectual virtue. No doubt an oppressive fideism and a hostile skepticism endlessly evoke and feed each other. We may now be at a moment when totalizing fideism is exposed as inadequate and when skeptical positivism is seen to be equally inadequate, when a genuinely thoughtful criticism can engage the density and depth of the text, which is available neither to fideism nor to skepticism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or a more technical plea to look at the text and not behind the text. The social world of a text does not explain the meaning of a text. For example, the social world of the Talmud does not explain the logic and meaning of the Gemara.</p>
<blockquote><p>A mere excavating of the social world behind the text, as if the text, itself, did not enter into the social construction of reality and provide an alternative &#8220;social&#8221; world of negotiation and definition, is a species of positivist reductionism. As Clifford Geertz once argued, this short-circuits the autonomous process of symbolic formulation. Geertz claims that such symbolic reductionism usually stems from theories whose &#8220;psychology is too anemic and whose sociology is too muscular&#8221; (Geertz 1973: 202). How what is said is crucial to what is said. </p>
<p>The Old Testament scholar, Walter Brueggemann, has recently eloquently argued that rhetorical criticism is an indispensable complement in biblical studies to sociological analysis. Echoing Geertz&#8217;s strictures, he deplores forms of historical criticism (of which the sociology of the Bible is a sub-set) which explain away literary cunning such that &#8220;what is interesting and dense in the text has been often forfeited&#8221; (Brueggeman 1997: 103). As he puts it, historical criticism &#8220;runs the risk that the methods and assumptions to which it is committed may miss the primary intentionality of the text&#8221; (Brueggemann 1997: 104).</p></blockquote>
<p>Brueggermann reviewed James Kugel&#8217;s 2003 <em>The God of Old: Inside the Lost World of the Bible</em> and thought that Kugel agreed with his seeking theological meaning as more important than history. But Kugel&#8217;s recent book sings a different song.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the other hand, Kugel refers to “The Project” by which he seems to mean a theological investigation into the “realness of things” that lies deep beneath the appearances that are so taken for granted among us: “They [the texts] can indeed come back to life, and their world, their way of seeing, can let us in to take the measure of things that are strange” (p. 3). At the end, Kugel concludes: “It is important to glimpse how things once were otherwise; certainly we then may better understand where the present came from. And perhaps also for another reason, somewhat more sublime: to remember that that ‘otherwise’ is, for all that has intervened, not unrelated to what exists in the fullest reality of today” (p. 199).<br />
Thus in the most restrained and almost whimsical way, Kugel’s ultimate concern is not historical but contemporary.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So what can be used from Brueggermann for an Orthodox approach? What cannot be used?</strong><br />

				<p>Since nobody had any clarifying comments on the Kugel post and it just got 600 hits in a day, let&#8217;s try a different approach.<br />
Here was one of the useful comments by Reb Yudel- any thoughts for an Orthodoxy? </p>
<p>1] How much history are you willing to give up to make a usable Torah both critical and as Talmud Torah?</p>
<p>I’m certainly willing to give up the scholarly agnosticism over things that are unknown and cannot be proven. Kugel ignores redactional history, presumably because it’s all hypothetical. I’m willing to assume a redactor, and throw R into the mix. I’m willing to assume that J played a redactorial role, collating and creating etiological folk tales. As a result, I can preach the moral growth of Judah, as cited by Sommers. Talmud Torah, unlike academia, does not require absolute proof.</p>
<p>&gt; 2] How much are you willing to defend an ethical message in the Bible despite historical origins?</p>
<p>That’s really the wrong question. The real question is, when did Modern Orthodoxy decide that Torah was ethical (and then why did it more recently renounce that view)? I don’t want unethical texts taught to my children, regardless of whether they were composed in the Iron Age or the Ipod Age. If Kugel makes it easier to remove Joshua from the 4th grade curriculum, so much the better.</p>
<p>(There’s a related question: When did Modern Orthodoxy abandon Hazal in favor of literary pshat? Why does Rashi’s division of characters into Righteous and Evil (following Hazal, of course) seem less appealing than the grays of literary analysis peshat?)</p>
<p>3] What needs to be added to Sommers to make it useful for Orthodoxy?</p>
<p>I don’t think Orthodoxy — which we can now define as the portion of Judaism which rejects the ordination of women — is impacted by any epistemology of Torah other than that which attributes absolute Divine Revelation to its current leadership. (Sort of like Mormonism, except without the transparency). Grant Daas Torah, and then the whole thing works.</p>
<p>For Conservative Judaism, which took the claims of academic Rabbinic scholarship as a lesson in the plasticity of Rabbinic halacha, the Sommers approach works fine: Torah SheBaal Peh simply goes back to [the putative date of] Sinai, to the tales and ballads that accompanied the evolution of our people.</p>
<p>As you say, Kugel is not a theologian, and his final chapter is weak: It simply peters out. Had he simply said, “I believe that part of my service to God is by following the tradition of my ancestor, and looking to the sacred anthology of Iron Age documents for meaning, knowing that the process of that search will itself create meaning” — he could have opened a door for a certain liberal Orthodoxy. Unfortunately, Kugel evinces no awareness of Talmud Torah as practiced around the Shabbos table or in the classroom..</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Apropos to the Kugel discussion- Here are some quotes from Brevard Childs who was at Yale from the 1960&#8217;s until the 1990&#8217;s.  Childs treats the Bible as a Christian work through the eyes of the Church even as he uses Biblical criticism. His approach is called &#8220;canonical criticism&#8221; is &#8220;an examination of the final form of the text as a totality, as well as the process leading to it.&#8221;  &#8220;Whereas previous criticism asked questions about the origins, structure and history of the text, canonical criticism addresses questions of meaning, both for the community (and communities &#8211; subsequent communities are regarded as being as important as the original community for which it was produced) which used it, and in the context of the wider canon of which it forms a part.&#8221;<br />
Childs was criticized on both sides &#8211; by Biblical scholars who wanted the text to remain in its bronze age meaning or documentary meaning and by fundamentalists who rejected any criticism. I am not advocating Childs&#8217; approach, I repeat I am not advocating Childs&#8217; theories. I am posting this as a sense of what most non-Jewish Bible professors that I know had to read in graduate school and it served as a basis for any further thinking they did on the topic. It also serves as a basis for many of the readings in an undergraduate Bible course. Many introductory courses try to show continuity with the tradition. </p>
<p>Childs&#8217; approach influenced Levenson, Fishbane, and other Jewish scholars who read the Bible with the Second temple and Rabbinic commentary, who look for intertextuality within the Bible itself, and treat the Bible as a Jewish work. The Jewish authors developed their own approaches but Childs is one of the many building blocks. Maybe I might post on some of the other building blocks. And as Benjamin Sommers pointed out &#8211; for many people Kugel&#8217;s book <em>The Bible As It Was</em> &#8211; his book on Midrash was taken as an extension of Brevard Childs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Brevard S. Childs is author of Biblical Theology in Crisis, and The Book of Exodus and Isaiah<br />
CHILDS: I have always objected to the term &#8220;canon(ical) criticism&#8221; as a suitable description of my approach. I do not envision my approach as involving a new critical methodology analogous to literary, form, or redactional criticism. Rather, the crucial issue turns on one&#8217;s initial evaluation of the nature of the biblical text being studied. By defining one&#8217;s task as an understanding of the Bible as the sacred Scriptures of the church, one establishes from the outset the context and point-of-standing of the reader within the received tradition of a community of faith and practice. Likewise, Scripture is also confessed to be the vehicle of God&#8217;s self-disclosure which continues to confront the church and the world in a living fashion. In sum, its content is not merely a literary deposit moored in the past, but a living and active text addressing each new generation of believer, both Jew and Christian. </p></blockquote>
<p>Childs accepts a unified approach without separate documents and looks for intertextuality. He sees the text as having a revelatory message from God. Notice his description of the human and divine elements and his definition of revelation. Later parts of the Bible were already hearing fresh insights into God&#8217;s prior words. It is quite Christian but it was still influential on Jews. Notice the subtlety of his view of revelation. On needs to hear a powerful theological message from the Bible. </p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, the Bible is also a human work written as a testimony to God&#8217;s coercion of a historical people, and extended and developed through generations of Israel&#8217;s wrestling with its God. The goals of interpretation can be defined in countless different ways, but for those confessing its role as sacred Scripture the goal is to penetrate deeply into its content, to be illuminated theologically by its Word, and to be shaped and transformed by its gracious disclosure which witness is continually made alive by its divine communicator.<br />
 The divine and human dimensions of Scripture can never be separated as if there were a kernel and a husk, but the heart of the Bible lies in the mystery of how a fully time-conditioned writing, written by fragile human authors, can continually become the means of hearing the very Word of God, fresh and powerful, to recipients open to faithful response.<br />
 First, I remain deeply concerned with the unity of the book which, I agree, cannot be formulated in terms of a single authorship.<br />
  Secondly, one of the most important recent insights has been the recognition of the role of intertextuality. The growth of the larger composition has often been shaped by the use of a conscious resonance with a previous core of oral and written texts. The great theological significance is that intertextuality reveals how the editors conceived of their task as forming a chorus of different voices and fresh interpretations, but all addressing in different ways, and in different ages a part of the selfsame, truthful witness to God&#8217;s salvific purpose for his people. </p></blockquote>
<p> Taken from Brevard Childs&#8217; Old Testament Theology in a Canonical Context.</p>
<blockquote><p>If one asks what was God&#8217;s purpose, that is, his motivation in revealing himself, the Old Testament is silent. However, if one asks what was God&#8217;s purpose, that is, his goal toward which his self-disclosure pointed, then the Old Testament is eloquent in its response.
