					<description><![CDATA[Jewish scientists tend to bifurcate more in my limited experience.  Definately non-Orthodox, but even Orthodox.

I could give either historical or theological reasons, but that doesn&#039;t answer the question. 

It&#039;s also that the defination of what someone Jewish is very different from what someone Christian.  

How about the most brilliant Jewish professors who thinks about and writes about Jewish themes?

Auman, Idel, Robert Pollack, Noah Feldman?]]></description>

I dont know. I just found it interesting. So, who would be the 20 Jewish professors in English? Brilliant is not the same thing as being a competent historian. Boyarin, Levenson, Fishbane? Roland Hoffman and Robert Aumann? Would Judith Butler count? Harold Bloom? Moshe Idel  and Moshe Halbertal? Certainly Michael Waltzer. Baruch Brody? More scientists who stake religious claims needed.]]></description>

Is this deliberate or just incidental?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to admit that I have not heard of, much less read, most of the mentioned professors, but any list that includes the author of Gilead (and Home) gets my immediate endorsement.

And Donald Knuth is a serious Christian - who knew!  But is it really the case that he &quot;[sees his Christianity] as significantly impacting [his] intellectual work&quot; - on theoretical computer science, algorithms and TeX?]]></description>
