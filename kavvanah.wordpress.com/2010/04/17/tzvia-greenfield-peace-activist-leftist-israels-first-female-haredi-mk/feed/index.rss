					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/04/17/tzvia-greenfield-peace-activist-leftist-israels-first-female-haredi-mk/#comment-839&quot;&gt;Alan Brill&lt;/a&gt;.

The problem is that while the self-denomination is useful in understanding the person (assuming she really does call herself Chareidi, which is not a given; it rather looks like the label was applied by the journalist), but not in understanding how the surrounding society relates to that person.

I don&#039;t think that, from the perspective of the article you brought us, which is not about Greenfield, but about whether and how she can impact others, particularly Chareidim, her self denomination is so important. It is much more important to know how she is perceived by those others she tries to impact.

Regarding all the examples you brought I would also suggest that they show how labels cannot pigeonhole every person, and that in such cases, sociologists and journalists alike should admit the existence of large grey zones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People self-apply denominations all the time. 
I dont want to talk about specific people but here are some examples of people I know who are closer to home.

Think of a YU graduate who moved to a hardei neighborhood, sends his kids to Haredi schools, thinks the majority of Modern Orthodox are not really orthodox, has adopted Charedi social mores but is insistent they he represents Modern Orthodoxy.  Would you consider that person Modern Orthodox? His self-identification is still with his MO classmates, friends, and teachers.  He may think for whatever woolly reason that the haredi life represents MO, but he continues to be concerned only with his old friends and entirely with the ideas of the community that created him. 

On the other side think of the YU graduate who is no longer shomer Shabbat or kashrut and made  it big financially in business. He  no longer lives in an MO neighborhood  but still considers himself MO and actually sits on the board of several MO institutions as a proud representative of MO. At donor dinners, the Rabbis praise him as a paradigm of the Mo community. He has no secular or liberal identity and sees himself as a loyal product of MO.  Is that person not modern orthodox in self-identity?

Or even closer to home, what of the Haredi who goes to med school and sends his kids to med school and now lives in an MO neighborhood and is haredi because they dress in traditional long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s quite apparent that the title is both self -applied and self-serving, as well as a provocation. 

Still, it is an important provocation to both the chareidi communities whose emphasis on social conformation in dress and manner makes it comically easy for a woman in a sheitel to call herself chareidi no matter what she thinks and does; and to the left, who often find chareidim noxious to the point of being unable to occupy the same social space. 

And while Har Nof is mostly a chareidi slum these days, there are still a number of families who live there who are DL or Anglo to the point that they don&#039;t really count as Israeli chareidim.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She has some thoughtful ideas, and is definitely more aware than most about how to bring about certain changes in traditional society, but I am at loss as to why she is called Chareidi, since she doesn&#039;t identify with Chareidim, sends her kids to a national religious high school, and otherwise maintains ideas that are foreign even to many Modern Orthodox &#038; National Religious. Perhaps &quot;Israel&#039;s first still-religious female Hareidi-raised Meretz MK&quot; would be a more appropriate title. But then again, I am not sure that she is the first.]]></description>
