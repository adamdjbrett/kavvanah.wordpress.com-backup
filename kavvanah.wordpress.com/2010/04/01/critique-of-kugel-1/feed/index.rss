					<description><![CDATA[I am reading this in amazement as to how the BTs were lied about by your culture. People rejected the secular vision in search for the truth and Orthodoxy doesn&#039;t care about the truth, they only care about the habit and the community and the sacred task of perpetuating the dysfunction forever.
You people can use a prophet to shame you about your predicament.
 	P.S. And what about people getting worked up about the Chabad idol worship. If your text and tradition is flawed about the central characters including Moshe himself, what difference would it make if RAMASH is consider a mashiyach but an equally stubborn and misguided bunch? Really?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also find Kugel&#039;s idea of how the Bible &#039;became&#039; a divine document to be very interesting. It seems rather strange altogether to envisage a God who reveals himself via an interpretive revolution of a text which was previously political propaganda, and who mandated (Kol ha&#039;omer ... ein lo cheleck la&#039;olam haba), due to this very revolution, a false belief regarding the authorship of the Torah text.
The biggest problem with the book, as noted by Dr. Brill, is that Kugel doesn&#039;t tell us about that nature of the historical evidence that has lead contemporary Biblical Scholars to where they are now. I once tried to engage Kugel in a discussion as to why I should take his reading of the historical data more seriously than than of say Kenneth Kitchen, but I didn&#039;t get very far.
If he would have started with, say, the archeological studies which argue that Jericho didn&#039;t exist at the time of the conquest, explained the evidence, and proceeded from there, I submit that the discussions we are currently having about his work would be much more productive than the wheel-spinning that we are currently engaged in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; 1] How much history are you willing to give up to make a usable Torah both critical and as Talmud Torah?

I&#039;m certainly willing to give up the scholarly agnosticism over things that are unknown and cannot be proven.  Kugel ignores redactional history, presumably because it&#039;s all hypothetical. I&#039;m willing to assume a redactor, and throw R into the mix. I&#039;m willing to assume that J played a redactorial role, collating and creating etiological folk tales. As a result, I can preach the  moral growth of Judah, as cited by Sommers. Talmud Torah, unlike academia, does not require absolute proof.

&#062; 2] How much are you willing to defend an ethical message in the Bible despite historical origins?

That&#039;s really the wrong question. The real question is, when did Modern Orthodoxy decide that Torah was ethical (and then when did it more recently renounce that view)? I don&#039;t want unethical texts taught to my children, regardless of whether they were composed in the Iron Age or the Ipod Age. If Kugel makes it easier to remove Joshua from the 4th grade curriculum, so much the better.

(There&#039;s a related question: When did Modern Orthodoxy abandon Hazal in favor of pshat? Why does Rashi&#039;s division of characters into Righteous and Evil (following Hazal, of course) seem less appealing than the grays of peshat?)

3] What needs to be added to Sommers to make it useful for Orthodoxy?

I don&#039;t think Orthodoxy -- which we can now define as the portion of Judaism which rejects the ordination of women -- is impacted by any epistemology of Torah other than that which attributes absolute Divine Revelation to its current leadership. (Sort of like Mormonism, except without the transparency). Grant R Daas Torah, and then the whole thing works.


For Conservative Judaism, which took the claims of academic Rabbinic scholarship as a lesson in the plasticity of Rabbinic halacha, the Sommers approach works fine: Torah SheBaal Peh simply goes back to [the putative date of] Sinai, to the tales and ballads that  accompanied the evolution of our people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James Kugel makes the Orthodox very uncomfortable because of one simple reason: his arguments are sound and based on solid scholarship. Orthodoxy has not really confronted modern scholarship in any meaningful (read satisfying) way and usually attempts to either ignore it or brush it aside (&quot;it&#039;s a dead theory&quot;, &quot;Hoffman demolished it&quot;). Of course, most folks - like Reb Yudel above - will usually begin with the ad hominum &quot;he&#039;s an apikores&quot; in an attempt to co-opt the discussion.

What one DOES with Kugel is another matter entirely. I think that most people will not reject Orthodoxy outright regardless of the challenges to TMS, simply because the community bond is so strong.

For those who honestly question and don&#039;t shun works that challenge core beliefs, Kugel - and others of his ilk - will remain relevant until other authors present a more convincing alternative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reb Yudel,
You said over yom tov that Kugel separates Talmud Torah from the Bible.
Since one cannot teach Kugel to kids or at a shabbos table:
1] How much history are you willing to give up to make a usable Torah both critical and as Talmud Torah?
2] How much are you willing to defend an ethical message in the Bible despite historical origins?
3] What needs to be added to Sommers to make it useful for Orthodoxy? 

Ben,
Look at Herder on &quot;theory of interpretation,&quot; which was used by Kugel in his book on Biblical Poetry. For Herder, literary   interpretation is a product of modernity. The Bible is  not literary in the modern sense. 
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/herder/#LanIntTra
Herder was the one who innovated the idea that every book must be read in its historical context. And Herder specifically mentions that the Bible must be read as a secular historian, not as a theologian, philosopher, or literary critic. 
Herder thought romantic style was modern and the Biblical style of parallelism was primitive. 
Kugel&#039;s idea of Biblical Poetry (1981) was read by many as implying that the Bible was literature in the modern sense, but he never said that. Kugel always separated modern literature from the principles of ancient literature. His readers did not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Another question: why did this book wake up Orthodoxy from their dogmatic slumbers more than other works? Why are Orthodox still interested in the book? 

How could you not mention the interwebs? Brettler&#039;s book was published in the Paleolithic Age (2005). Also, Kugel has been or is called, or he calls himself, Orthodox (as you allude to by noting that he speaks in Orthodox synagogues, but of course the reason why he is asked to speak is because he is considered to be at least Orthoprax, something  which cannot be said of Conservative or Masorti associated scholars). Also, his credentials are seemingly greater than someone like Brettler (Harvard being a more magical word than Brandeis). In short, the perfect storm.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple points. One is that he knows hazal and traditional parshanut -- he&#039;s not an am haaretz, so therefore he&#039;s an apikores. That&#039;s why the last chapter was so disappointing for believers -- he promised to solve all the problems but where they thought they might meet the second coming of Hertz....

A question: How did it come to pass that Modern Orthodoxy abandoned traditional parshanut -- Kugel&#039;s Four Assumptions -- and embraced the literary approach?

As you say, Kugel is not a theologian, and his final chapter is weak: It simply peters out. Had he simply said, &quot;I believe that part of my service to God is by following the tradition of my ancestor, and looking to the sacred anthology of Iron Age documents for meaning, knowing that the process of that search will itself create meaning&quot; -- he could have opened a door for a certain liberal Orthodoxy. Unfortunately, Kugel evinces no awareness of Talmud Torah as practiced around the Shabbos table or in the classroom.

Perhaps instead of a critique, you should write a piece of constructivist theology, reframing Kugel in a more sophisticated and practical manner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually wanted to say that I am rather ignorant about biblical criticism. At some pointed I started reading Harold Bloom but never actually read a book that speaks about the biblical alphabet soup. But this book for me is not about criticism, there is a poetic quality about Kugel writing that resonates with me strongly.

For me God resides inside a creative expression. I feel kinship with the authors and I don&#039;t feel that Kugel denies this key aspect to the biblical authors. Moreover his own inspired writing is an example of it.

Great, so why this book greater than the many other great critical works on the Bible?  Is it just that the internet pointed you to this one and did not point you other works? Or is it that he actually was directly head on critical of the literary, canonical, and religious readings?  I do think it is an important book but its innovation is not as just another work of Biblical criticism. Can you describe why it is a qualitative leap and so moving? 
I was disappointed by the critiques as not catching the rhetoric of the book. I was not saying it was not a great read.
Now, if only the web would be filled with discussions of Der Nister.]]></description>
