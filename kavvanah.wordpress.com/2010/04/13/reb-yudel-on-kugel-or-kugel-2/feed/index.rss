					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’d say that the real question is, when did Modern Orthodoxy decide that the Torah was redacted from multiple sources?&quot;

Gil, you must have missed our most recent meeting. I&#039;m emailing you the most recent &quot;Nimnu V&#039;Gamru: Proceedings of the most Learned Elders of Modern Orthodoxy, Vol XXVII, Issue 3 where you can find the relevant rulings on both the ordination of women (thumbs down) and the redactional history of the Bible (thumbs up.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Brill, thank you for the emailed articles I would read it soon. As far as blogging is concerned I am a purist, therefore there is a bit of an asymmetry. If you ask people to contribute ideas without showing any of your cards, while prepping for a publication, what&#039;s the point of the conversation and is it &quot;ethical&quot; towards the commentators?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’m willing to assume a redactor, and throw R into the mix. I’m willing to assume that J played a redactorial role, collating and creating etiological folk tales.&quot;

&quot;The real question is, when did Modern Orthodoxy decide that Torah was ethical (and then why did it more recently renounce that view)?&quot;

I&#039;d say that the real question is, when did Modern Orthodoxy decide that the Torah was redacted from multiple sources?

&quot;I don’t think Orthodoxy — which we can now define as the portion of Judaism which rejects the ordination of women...&quot;

I think the 13 Ikkarim, in one form or another, is also part of the definition of Orthodoxy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“not good enough to publish”. 

It is assumed that I have the same disclaimer. 

&quot;you in agreement with Sumners&quot;

No, if so I would not have written my critique. 

&quot;So my point is what do you think really?&quot;

The critique was my opinion.  Everything now is a scratch pad to formulate my actual write up of Kugel over the summer.  Since I have other concerns by day - my comments are here for long term percolation before submission elsewhere.  Have you started to edit some of your posts for submission to an editor, found likely venues, and contacted editors? I accept standard publishing as the criteria and academic publishing as a good thing. So of course, for me this is a scratch pad and micro comments of others that directly relate to a line that I have written are useful for formulating a final draft.
If you want to continue a meta-discussion of blogigng or a discussion of getting your stuff published then contact me by regular email or FB.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nasim Taleb has a big fat disclaimer on his web site that he puts there only material that is &quot;not good enough to publish&quot;. 

Take the Kugel for example. You published here a list of cryptic questions about his work, links to what someone wrote about Kugel, now someone’s comments to the list of your questions. 

If for professional, commercial, religious or any other reasons you don&#039;t want to highlight your opinion, that’s perfectly understandable.  But here is the question you ask almost on every post. What do you think?

May be you should have a disclaimer that you don’t express your opinions on the blog. But someone said on my blog that you in agreement with Sumners in favoring the theologians approach (another thing why the heck Sumners would publish in the academic baseball magazine that no body get or reads). What did he actually say?

So my point is what do you think really?]]></description>
