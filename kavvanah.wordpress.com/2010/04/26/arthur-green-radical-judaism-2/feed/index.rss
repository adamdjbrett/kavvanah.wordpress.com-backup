					<description><![CDATA[To use one myth(preoedipal)to attempt to debunk another makes little sense. Rabbi Green&#039;s &quot;quantity&quot; vs. &quot;quality&quot; descriptions in interpreting Jewish practice is close to the heart of the matter for those of us who are &quot;seekers&quot; of meaning in daily life. What Rabbi Green delivers is a Judaism with roots extending back to traditions but meaningful for living today.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To ej - your criticism of mystical paths of unity as attempts towards regressive merger may be enlightened by referring to Ken Wilber&#039;s discussion of the &quot;pre-trans fallacy.&quot; Certainly much of what is marketed as &quot;trans&quot; rational is in fact &quot;pre,&quot; but reducing all of one to the other would split reality in half, ignoring so much of what may very well underlie even the more traditional world view.]]></description>

I may quote you on his “breite playtzus” since the beginning of his career. You posted a while back that you bought the book, correct?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those who have had the privilege of meeting Rabbi Arthur Green will agree that he is just a wonderful person, decent, unassuming, warm, friendly, easy to talk to, a total mensch. When you compare his sweet personality with his theology there is this huge discrepancy. When it comes to speaking his mind he has no fear. He will go where his spirit and intuition lead, no matter how far away it may be from traditional thought. In Yiddish we call this &quot;breite playtzus,&quot; broad shoulders. And it&#039;s been this way I would conjecture from the very beginning of his career. I guess this quality is necessary in a leader, were it not that traditionally there was a rabbinical caste to keep a gadol from roaming too far off the plantation. But in the space where Rabbi Green lives there are no such constraints.I hope future students of Rabbi Green  get a better handle on  how these two aspects of his personality mesh.

This brings me to my second point. I&#039;ve been thinking why I so resist Jewish Renewal theologies. My tentative answer today is that such mystical ideas are of interest to those who welcome regressions to a pre-Oedipal stage of development, a place where there is no threatening father, no frightening aspects of reality, where a unity with the mother does not bring out either depressive or paranoid positions. It&#039;s a place of deep peace and joy with no downside. All that prevents us from acheiving this desirable place is our materialism and fear of letting go. 

Rabbi Green&#039;s theology should be understood as based on a deep longing for such pre-Oedipal moments of merger and unification, and its validity might very well hang on the question whether such regressions are desirable.]]></description>
