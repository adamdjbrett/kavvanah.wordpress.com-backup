					<description><![CDATA[See the sidebar of solitude-hisbodedus.blogspot.com under the headings &quot;Kabbalists&quot; and &quot;Other Chassidic Masters.&quot; But the Komarno material remains mostly untranslated. 

You could find it in a recent series of meditation manuals based on Heichal HaBerakhah called &quot;Be&#039;er Eliyahu,&quot; sold through Biegeleisen&#039;s Seforim on Sixteenth Ave. in Borough Park. The best place to start might be the small volume subtitled &quot;Achdus HaOlamos&quot; (from which the translation on the Solitude blog was taken).]]></description>

Why would you want to divorce the kavannos from the Shemoneh Esreh? These kavannos were developed to fit that vehicle specifically.

On the other hand, there are kabbalistic kavannos / visualizations, such as those of the Sefer HaBris and those of the Komarno Rebbe in Heichal HaBrochah, etc., that are not connected to the Shomoneh Esreh. If that&#039;s what you want to do, why not use those methods?]]></description>

This may be the crucial point of where and why Kabbalah did not truly develop a meditation tradition even if they had the techniques. 
Ramak has some of the same meditations without the liturgy in his Pardes Rimonim but I cannot see him advocating a practice without the liturgy. I can look to find where he states that it 
should/must/is only efficacious with the liturgy but I think the issue goes deeper. Hayyim Vital in his Shaarei Kedushah has meditations without liturgy and it creates a different spirituality.
The Hasidic tradition of Komarno has 202 meditations outside of the liturgy that have similar effect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you are refering to taking internal tantric meditations out of the context of long liturgical style sadhanas. That is actually not such a radical idea in Vajrayana, it is done all the time. Maybe it is in Kabbalah too, but it seems much more rare. I was wondering if there would be some axiomatic reason why it would not work, which would not be the case in Vajrayana.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not sure he is measuring accomplishment. In fact, I think he is not.
The instructions become habitual in a few weeks and there is no outside Roshi accessing you progress. Just daven this way. 
One would indeed be thrust back to conventional consciousness if one knew where he was. 
So after time one learns to retain focus. 
I know davveners who have the opposite problem, they get lost in the state of binah and forget about the siddur or that they have to return. 
Your right, i dont think he means it mechanically but how else does one create a manual for mental states? In addition, one gets a general sense of the pattern without having to look at the script. If every berakhah is a downward movement and the words Barukh atah hashem are always the same then the middle words are an ever regressing downward movement in which there are variants that usually correspond to practice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[His analysis brings up a point that seldom gets resolved; what mediates the disparity between aspiration and accomplishment? If we know what it is that we are trying to do, how do we know how close we have actually come? If we were to have realization of the &#039;collapsed telescope&#039; and stop in the middle to acknowledge it we would be instantly thrust back into conventional consciousness, no? Isn&#039;t the process of personal assessment linear and self-referential? It brings up some issues that are very tricky. I assume that these instructions are not meant to be taken mechanically, but instead offer a guideline to inquiry that is more or less a blueprint for a methodology. I assume the RAMAK would not encourage students to qualify or quantify the ascent. No?]]></description>
