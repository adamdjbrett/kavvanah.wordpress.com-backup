					<description><![CDATA[I told this over on Shabbos and said that Rabbinic Judaism as currently prayed out is not a culture of &quot;second chances&quot; (in contrast to the Chumash which is full of second chances).

My wife noted that we live in a culture that cannot tolerate the idea of failure or that one has to spend the next 30 years doing Teshuva for ones Aveiros. So, therefore, we now need a holiday of second chances.  

I suppose that the reason why Pesach Sheni is a great holiday to take on completely new meanings is because it is on every Orthodox Jews&#039; calendar, but has little actual content/substance. It&#039;s also easy to practice by just eating leftover matzah &#038; thinking about second chances.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You omit an important detail here. Someone actually send me the three maymorim yesterday (I cant read this anymore). Including the one you quote from Lamed Hes. All  the maymorim where said on the yahrzeit of Yisroel Are Leib, the Rebbes brother on the 13th. YAL was openly nonreligious, hence the personal theme in this message. The Rebbe was talking about his own brother.]]></description>
