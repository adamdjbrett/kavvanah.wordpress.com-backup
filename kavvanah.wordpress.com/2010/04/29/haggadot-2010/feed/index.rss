					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the Sacks shlit&quot;a Haggadah, assuming that Sacks writes his own books, to what degree is his specific language that important?  

Presumably he is processing his earlier sources and reformulating them in his own words. 

Especially as he has been attacked for what he says and who he quotes, he is probably very careful about how he formulates his ideas. 

Not to harp on a side point, but why not blaim the rabbanim for what is printed in their name? I could speculate about justifying their &quot;Haggadot&quot;, but ultimately, they have a veto power about what is printed by Artscroll in their name.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could you please explain the Artscroll gibberish ones? What exactly was the problem? Lack of quotation marks?

Maybe you could please post one representative quotation? If you don&#039;t want to reveal which book, what if you take that representative quote, change its references (if it used to say &quot;The RambaN quotes Sanhedrin 55&quot;, change it to &quot;The Rif quotes Nedarim 22&quot;, i.e. keep the structure but just completely changes all citations), and neglect to tell us its source. That way, we can see what you&#039;re talking about, but you won&#039;t reveal which book you&#039;re quoting.]]></description>
