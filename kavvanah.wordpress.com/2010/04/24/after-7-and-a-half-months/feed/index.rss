					<description><![CDATA[I like the FFdm better than the FFdO. The woodcut is distinct.
unfortunately,  the copy on Hebrew books has recent English translations above several words? 
Is there a clean copy online?

Moish,
It is on my list of things to do, maybe for Elul. We can use the mussar then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, there&#039;s always the Gemara or the Rif

http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37970&#038;st=&#038;pgnum=238

It&#039;s still 3 font sizes, 4 if you count the title, main, Ra&quot;n, and Shiltei Giborim.  You could move the text block to the bottom of the page, and put the picture of the gemara page on top, giving you better exposure for the title LFNI at the top of your page.

Or for the archaic look, how about FFdM 1720 edition, at http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42050&#038;st=&#038;pgnum=3

Four type sizes: titles, main, rashi, ein mishpat ner mitzva

I have an AZ of similar vintage, I&#039;ll send you pictures of the first page (no shaar-blatt, as published - Haberman)  Nice little woodcut around the initial word.  Berlin/FFdO, 1739.

The opening word of the Bomberg Yerushalmi (1523) is fairly pretty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/after-7-and-a-half-months/#comment-857&quot;&gt;Jon Baker&lt;/a&gt;.

I have the Talmud scanned and we played with it for the last cover.
It is not just font size but the effect on the eye. If you crop only the top third of the daf, then your eye go out toward the edges, the Rah and the Gilyon Hashas. Daf 21b has a nice centered graphic sense to it.  
The Rambam left the eye in the center. So i take this as a vote to change the text also?]]></description>
