					<description><![CDATA[That was a very strong speech.

It&#039;s not clear to me how the Church would benefit by further clarifying their theological stance on the Jews.  They&#039;re already fighting internal battles over it, and short of deciding that there is no need for even mission to the Jews (i.e., that the Jews have a path of their own to salvation and have no need at all for Jesus and the Church), they&#039;ve may have benefited as much as they can in the inter-faith relationship.  

Any further movement towards acknowledging that the Jews already have their own path to salvation would likely  further alienate the more conservative of their clergy and lay folk who read the Cathechism as reinforcing the Church&#039;s historical (pre-Vatican II) stance.  Movement away would strengthen those in the Jewish camp who never acknowledged the Church&#039;s Vatican II overture as anything substantial, and who criticized the inter-faith effort from the outset.

Perhaps their current stance is as good as it will get?]]></description>
