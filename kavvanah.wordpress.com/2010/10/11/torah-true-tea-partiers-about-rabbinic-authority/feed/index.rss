					<description><![CDATA[http://www.app.com/article/20101021/NEWS/101020004/In-Lakewood-influence-splinters-for-Jewish-leaders-Vaad
&lt;blockquote&gt;Scroll forward eight years to 2010, and it&#039;s the Vaad that&#039;s now experiencing a jolt … one so intense a local official likened it to an &quot;Orthodox Tea Party&#039;&#039; backlash.
Known as a potent political force able to steer entire voting blocs, this body of rabbis, businessmen and government liaisons was unable in recent months to muster enough Orthodox community support for its most established darling.
In this bubble of rigid customs and clear hierarchies, a consensus has formed that the grip of the old order is slipping as technology and new thinking take hold.
It is struggling, they say, to keep up with an expanding Orthodox population as fresh voices speak out and the economy shifts personal priorities.
&quot;We&#039;re at a point where the community has minds of its own and does not just follow recommendations without understanding them,&#039;&#039; Vaad member Avrohom Moshe Muller said. &quot;It puts us in a different position.&#039;&#039;
Some Lakewood leaders argue that a splintered Orthodox constituency may hurt the town&#039;s influence at the state level. Others see the diminished leadership role as a healthy swing toward an open political system&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Can you explain this a bit more? How? Who? What would have been without the internet?

The influence of Israeli poskim, for one thing. Before widespread internet use, I do not recall the regular dissemination of the up-to-the-minute pesak of Israeli Da&#039;as Torah.  

Actually, allow me to post an amazing statement in a widely distributed printed pamphlet:

&quot;The anisakis question is not new but has recently caused quite a stir in the halachic community. The gedolei haposkim in Eretz Yisroel, Rav Eliyashiv shlit”a; Rav Wozner, shlit”a; Rav Nisin Karelitz shlit”a; Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlit”a; and Rav Moshe Sternbuch shlit”a among others, have all forbidden fish that may possibly contain the presence of the anisakis. They feel that the fish is forbidden min HaTorah, unless it has been checked.

&quot;Many distinguished חוץ לארץposkim (located outside of Eretz Yisroel) maintain that the Shulchan Aruch’s criteria for permitting these types of fish is that as long as the anisakis is generated in the flesh, the fish is permitted. 

&quot;Practically speaking, how will this controversy be resolved? This is a question of an אסור דאורייתא . I believe that just as kashrus has been vigilant regarding b’dikas toloyim on land, so too it will be vigilant in the sea. Kosher fish market mashgichim will be trained to spot worms on a lightbox or under ultraviolet light.&quot;
http://www.kashrut.com/articles/OpeningUpACanOfWorms/

To me this is amazing - and novel. Here you have a rabbi matter-of-factly telling the masses that the Americans tend to pasken le-kula (and apparently still hold that salmon is kosher) but the Israelis pasken le-chumra. So, practically speaking, opines this rabbi, what will probably happen is that light boxes are coming to a fish near you: that is, we will ignore our American poskim and pasken like the Israelis.

This is the new reality and examples like this mount every day. Strictly speaking, this isn&#039;t an internet phenomenon per se, but my contention is that it is the internet that has turned Israel into the neighborhood next door, that has turned a phone call away from a long-distance big deal into nothing at all. Webcasts, Youtube, Skype, email, blogs, even the print media-- all of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: where to look for the wave of Tea-Torah.  

Just as the union contracts of government workers can anger voters during a recession (e.g., &quot;I&#039;m surviving on less income, why do my taxes have to fund their raises?&quot;),  the length and tenure of pulpit contracts could help trigger congregant anger.   It is only natural that this would happen if a pulpit rabbi received a generous, long-term contract before the Great Recession began.

But  a professional rabbi would be financially dis-incented from making that argument (similarly, it&#039;s hard to find negligence lawyers advocating tort reform).   So I would raise my antennae to detect a lay leader, or at least a non-pulpit rabbi, riding the wave of such a movement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lakewood would be sui generis, expect for that it is basically the still growing center of American Charedi Judaism. (As an aside, someone needs to write a straightforward, honest, journalistic account of the rise, growth &#038; transformation of Lakewood, NJ from a small defunct resort town with a single (intentionally) out of the way Yeshiva run autocratically by a single family into the current massive, wild place that it is today).

Lakewood on many levels is different primarily because it is younger than almost all other Jewish communities in America so no one is able to control the community. The Agudah has minimal activity there. (As another aside, but relevant to this discussion, the Agudah strength, among the people, is primarily in &quot;out of town&quot; communities where being active in the Agudah can be an expression of their Judaism). 

The leadership of Bais Medrash Gevoha (BMG) has been attempting for years to force their will on the community (much to the resentment of even those who studied in BMG). The last attempt on the leadership&#039;s part, with mixed results, was when they forced all of the girls&#039; schools to not open until there was a spot for every girl in every High School. In contrast, when the Kotler family was running the show, there were no sit-down Pizza parlors allowed in Lakewood. 

In many ways this is just playing out the culture of BMG where there are no shiurim &#038; people basically join any chaburah that they want &#038; ties to the Yeshiva are just formal. (As yet another aside, the RY of the Mir in Jerusalem (with whom my brother is very close) has severely criticized BMG for this hefkervelt and, at some point, unsuccessfully attempted to open a Yeshiva in the NYC area as an alternative to Lakewood. )

But at this point most people are moving to Lakewood because of the cheap homes with all of the amenities of an ultra-Orthodox community, so they have no affiliation with BMG. 

Individuals such as Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen &#038; Rabbi Gissinger have set up little fiefdoms, but their authority is limited to members of this congregation.

I strongly believe that &quot;tea party&quot; arguments work better in Lakewood than in Washington Heights (KAJ) or other Jewish communities with a more centralized form of leadership. However, no one really wants to change American Chareidi halakha or the status quo. No one is going to start sending their children to public schools. So its application is rather limited.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EJ I don&#039;t think you are quite correct.  Remember that skeptic blogs are not really that old and that the people involved with them seem to go through stages of grief which focus them more on lost innocence than on new approaches.  However, most of them seem to stay within the frum community more or less as they reach &quot;acceptance&quot;.  Many of these people may be open to helping create new approaches to things.  Indeed, Judaism always had periods like this where someone had to create something new.  It could be as simple as this...egalitarian orthodox communities.  People who are committed to every other aspect of orthodoxy but cannot deal with separation of gender roles.  Frankly I believe that there is a huge market for that (and perhaps it will draw more from the conservative movement, but also from Orthodoxy).  All it will take is one serious Rabbi to move in this direction and voila.  That said, there are several ways in which this can work.  Firstly, the Nusach clarifications that are being embraced by both Sephardim and the new Nusach Eretz Yisrael could break things up.  Also the NeoHasidic approach could go modern orthodox or even conservative.   Finally, the tuition crisis is not a joke.  Indoctrination begins there...without the schools, the kids are going to get thrown in with the general population and that is almost certainly the direction thinks are heading in.]]></description>
