					<description><![CDATA[1) Putnam fails to mention the devastation brought about by yippies-hippies from one side and the Weathermen on the other. The labor union left never recovered. Much of the Orthodox rhetoric sounds to me like they are constantly reliving the traumas of that period. Either frum-frum  or nihilism and vice, with little in between.  2) Putnam’s claim that the dividing line between religious and non religious is premarital sex is not fully correct. It is pretty much a non-issue beginning with those left of Conservadox . Even in Orthodox blogs when the issue of tefilin dates comes up, most everyone remains sane. Orthodoxy goes ballistic over homosexuality, witness this Rabbi Levin moron. I think the reason is that many find even just imagining homosexual intercourse disgusting, a sort of violation of their bodies. A politician who favors gay marriage becomes by contagion muktzah machmas mius, irrespective of any other issues. 3) They don’t discuss the spectacular failure of stage two feminism. So many Jewish women who are now childless and of a certain age, regret their own decisions. This has accrued to Orthodoxy’s benefit since they seem to have no such problems. These days I think  this career talk while still present is quite subservient to family and children, even in non-Orthodox circles. The women don’t start hunting and fishing at 18, but by 28 they become acutely aware of the big 3-0. 4) The idea that religious people are the most benevolent  needs to be modified. After all Orthodoxy imports capital and tends to be quite weak in civic  and humanitarian activities. The standard bearers of charity remain the great Jewish Reform families. I just read a letter of a great grandchild who said “Thank you zaide for teaching me how to use a trust fund.” What is true is that these rich families form a network, but not one that is temple based. 5) The place where the turn to secularism is felt most are the Conservative synagogues. Everyone is so impressed with independent minyanim-Hadar, but they don’t amount to 50,000 people. Most everyone including the Chancellor is clueless what should be done about the million that remain, when the have turned so sour on congregational life.]]></description>
