					<description><![CDATA[I would suggest that DIY or Baal _______ Judaism will work best with these people.  Much like the popular Baal Tefilah prayer training program, young people like mastery, they like participating in group activities and they like ecstatic performances that take them away from themselves (like concerts).  All of these things can resonate well within a Jewish context.  Teach them how to pray like Chassids (like a mosh pit) and own the service.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Generational speculations are becoming an unfortunate speech tic of this blog. I am flummoxed as to how any of the above statements could mean much of anything. As a graduate student surrounded by graduate students, I am also particularly insulted by the infelicitous formulation that
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;We are also very different from them and difficult to fathom and identify with. We prize the life of the mind, we love to read, and we work long hours for relatively little money. We must remember that this generation values money and what it can buy. &quot;&gt;
There are more people who are reading books and care for the life of the mind than can be employed in our country. Perhaps what the author of this piece meant to say (other than that undergrads are alien lifeforms) is that academic labor has changed as universities have expanded into schools for the middle class and concomitantly deemphasized intensive liberal arts while relying on a contingent system of labor. Of course, it would be harder to critically analyze relations of labor and think about the shifting role of qualifications in over-determining societal roles (ala Pierre Bourdieu) than it would be to engage in facile narrative arcs about &quot;My Generation&quot;-- which happens to be a new primetime show on ABC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
