Shalom R Zusel,

I have not had the pleasure of attending a night to honor Israel, but I have been in countless similar events here in Israel, and my feelings are identical to what you stated here
&lt;b&gt;I truly believe, based on my experiences that the philosemetic Christians really believe that God really meant what is stated in Genesis 12:3 and they don’t want to be cursed by our mutual God.&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fewer words coming and going is my preference. As a Catholic Christian I have found Torah study to be a jaw dropping experience into understanding the spiritual teachings of Christ. My teacher is a rabbinical student from Manhattan. Once a month he comes to my church and unpackages all the exquisite nuances contained in the Hebrew words of the Torah with a little Kabbalah tossed in. While our teacher has no inkling of the revelatory impact of his teachings, our little band of Christians are often stunned as his teaching sends wave after wave of insight flooding into our minds and hearts. Our teacher has absolutely no knowledge of the New Testament, which is as it must be for the magnificent Jew that he is, but what he reveals to us about Torah is spiritual treasure for us Christians. I cannot get enough of his kind of teaching of the Torah&#039;s spiritual meaning. 
There can be only love between Christian and Jew when they speak to each other with the language of the spirit and the heart. It would be nice if we could leave the end times conversion matter up to Hashem and not try to get ahead of the process. Letting Hashem convert us individually is enough for now.]]></description>

Len,
The Holy See lists dialogue with Jews under ecumenicism with non-Catholic Christians and not as dialogue with non-Christian religions. 
We have not had any clarifying statements in several years to further clarify the documents.  Protestants are considered &quot;heretics, apostates, and schismatics&quot; but giving witness.]]></description>

If there&#039;s mission but no proselytizing I think that implies he considers the Jews to already be in the Church, but either operating in error or apostates.

Is that it?

And if so, care to say which view he holds?]]></description>

NJs to regard them AS Noachide laws (not de facto, as R. Steinsaltz and others propose), we really should know how, and how seriously, he takes them. Is he w/Rambam and most Charedi poskim about their historicity or R. David Novak and historical critical scholarship?

I would assume that he would claim to be the former but actually be closer to the latter (or de facto like Steinsaltz). You can email him or his handlers and ask. I think he would treat his new homily about the three covenant as Torah true, which he combines with Hirschman&#039;s book on universalism, Kellner on Maimonides, and Korn on the halakhic authorities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for chewing a bit on Hick&#039;s pluralism in your book - I didn&#039;t really notice its particular influences in &#039;interfaith dialogue&#039; until then, now I see it all over, truly insidious - invidious. Accepting people for whom they&#039;re not - in fact, for whom no one of faith actually is. I think R. Riskin is of a similar strain; Judaism actually &quot;is&quot; what it is, others are not REALLY what they are (or at least what they think they are) - so as with Hick&#039;s default-liberal-ambiguous universalism being the only thing that REALLY &quot;is&quot; - ambiguous universalisms are only offerings to be acknowledged from particularist others at the table.  Can Hick, R. Riskin or the Evangelicals really accept that none of them may be what they really are, and there are no temporal yardsticks? The Jewish *believing* Orthoprax academics can rely on &quot;Torah&quot; - the yardstick - &quot;is not in Heaven&quot;, it itself is literally even adjured here - so a maculate, BibCrit Torah and the evolving, historically-conditioned tradition that gave rise to it determines its reality here (at the same time liturgically/theologically saying it derives from Torah). Some fellow travelers with R. Riskin harbor these ideas, and believe others worth talking to in other religious must secretly agree with them - looking for others acknowledging the Church preceded the NT and authored it, while saying the NT gave rise to the Church - and the Church as an utterly-human institution - but if such cloistered intellectuals exist, they are probably at the same imaginary table as Hick&#039;s those &#039;whom no one of faith actually is&#039;; open Conservative (in the Jewish sense) Universalists breaking bread with &quot;on the down-low&quot; quasi-particularist universalists. But I have no idea what R. Riskin thinks the Noachide laws are supposed to be; literally given from Adam and Noach, etc, a post-exilic Rabbinic formulation with no actual historical sanction from On High? - what? If he&#039;s going to consider intellectually coercing NJs to regard them AS Noachide laws (not de facto, as R. Steinsaltz and others propose), we really should know how, and how seriously, he takes them. Is he w/Rambam and most Charedi poskim about their historicity or R.

					<description><![CDATA[I highly doubt he read any of my book. And I am not into joint covenants or Hick&#039;s pluralism. But your guess about the other source he read was correct, it was one of the two main voices in the article.
Christoph Cardinal Schönborn&#039;s position is more subtle. There is no two covenant theory or salvation by Hebrew Bible alone. He sees the Jewish covenant fulfilled in the new covenant. As he writes, there is mission but no proselytism. He avoids the word salvation and does see Judaism as not another relgion but as part of internal Christian ecumenicism, a part that is not fulfilled. 
&lt;em&gt;&quot;The fact that the Church has apologised for the diverse forms of compulsion which they have had to suffer throughout the Christian era implies that Christians have now irrevocably renounced all forms of proselytism. This does not mean that Christians for their part have abandoned the mandate to proclaim the Gospel &quot;to the Jews first&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
There remains a hole that allows the spirit of the new covenant to already be at work on people who heard the first covenant. Schönborn has an essay on Mesekhet Berakhot showing the work of the new covenant and its effects on the rabbinic concepts of berakhah and tefillah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first impression of Rabbi Riskin&#039;s paper was that he&#039;s been reading Alan Brill&#039;s most recent  book and some of Eugene Korn&#039;s work, and took them seriously.  He&#039;s applying a Jewish theology of other religions to the task of creating a common ground with Christianity.

I had some reservations about some of his points.

A covenant requires two participants.  In what he calls the third covenant, the human side doesn&#039;t have a representative from the gentile nations; only the Jews are there.  So I don&#039;t see how the gentiles can end up as one of the parties to the covenant as he states on page 19.

If  the covenant is for the Jews to witness God&#039;s word to the non-Jewish world, he&#039;s not presenting anything new, other than asking Jews to change their focus from an inward one to more of an outward one.  We are  supposed to be a &quot;kingdom of priests&quot;, as Rabbi Riskin points out.  Priests  serve in the name of God and teach.  Who should we Jews teach -- ourselves?  No -- the mandate is already clear for us to teach non-Jews.

Rabbi Riskin makes what I feel is a common error regarding our current relationship with the Christians.  He makes it seem as if the Christian world (in the form of &quot;leading theologians from most churches&quot;) really accepts the possibility that Judaism is salvific for the Jews.  It doesn&#039;t.  This issue is one that&#039;s controversial and open for discussion within the various churches.

The Roman Catholic church is publicly split on the  matter, with the liberal US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Central Committee of German Catholics and certain cardinals (including the Pope&#039;s principal adviser on Jewish-Catholic relations, Walter Kasper) most publicly accepting that Judaism does offer a second path outside the Church for salvation, while more conservative elements (including the Papal household&#039;s preacher Raniero Cantalamessa and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn) deny and reject that assertion.  Support for the idea is not reflected in the Catechism -- salvation is still only through the Church.  

Roman Catholics comprise only about half of the world&#039;s Christians.  In the US Baptist  and other Protestant churches, I can&#039; t imagine how the concept of a dual path to salvation could ever take root. 

We probably won&#039;t see this resolved any time soon, so perhaps Rabbi Riskin is remiss for writing as if it were a fait accompli.

Finally, I enjoyed how Rabbi Riskin turned the tables on the Christians with his three-step program.  We&#039;ve heard often about the Christian expectation that in the end of days Jews will convert to Christianity.  In the Jewish liturgy we have mention that  all nations will come to worship God in Jerusalem, but I think that this is first time a leader of the modern Jewish community has publicly speculated that perhaps the Christians will convert to Judaism!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first impression of Rabbi Riskin&#8217;s paper was that he&#8217;s been reading Alan Brill&#8217;s most recent  book and some of Eugene Korn&#8217;s work, and took them seriously.  He&#8217;s applying a Jewish theology of other religions to the task of creating a common ground with Christianity.</p>
<p>I had some reservations about some of his points.</p>
<p>A covenant requires two participants.  In what he calls the third covenant, the human side doesn&#8217;t have a representative from the gentile nations; only the Jews are there.  So I don&#8217;t see how the gentiles can end up as one of the parties to the covenant as he states on page 19.</p>
<p>If  the covenant is for the Jews to witness God&#8217;s word to the non-Jewish world, he&#8217;s not presenting anything new, other than asking Jews to change their focus from an inward one to more of an outward one.  We are  supposed to be a &#8220;kingdom of priests&#8221;, as Rabbi Riskin points out.  Priests  serve in the name of God and teach.  Who should we Jews teach &#8212; ourselves?  No &#8212; the mandate is already clear for us to teach non-Jews.</p>
<p>Rabbi Riskin makes what I feel is a common error regarding our current relationship with the Christians.  He makes it seem as if the Christian world (in the form of &#8220;leading theologians from most churches&#8221;) really accepts the possibility that Judaism is salvific for the Jews.  It doesn&#8217;t.  This issue is one that&#8217;s controversial and open for discussion within the various churches.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic church is publicly split on the  matter, with the liberal US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Central Committee of German Catholics and certain cardinals (including the Pope&#8217;s principal adviser on Jewish-Catholic relations, Walter Kasper) most publicly accepting that Judaism does offer a second path outside the Church for salvation, while more conservative elements (including the Papal household&#8217;s preacher Raniero Cantalamessa and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn) deny and reject that assertion.  Support for the idea is not reflected in the Catechism &#8212; salvation is still only through the Church.  </p>
<p>Roman Catholics comprise only about half of the world&#8217;s Christians.  In the US Baptist  and other Protestant churches, I can&#8217; t imagine how the concept of a dual path to salvation could ever take root. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think R. Riskin has something different in mind than the long-standing &quot;interreligious dialogue&quot; - the materials he presents for a missionizing Judaism indicate that (he also does so rather selectively; leaving out that Gentiles who do not accept Sheva Mitzvot should be executed [Hilkhot Melakhim 8,10]). To approach non-Jews on Noachide terms is to not approach them on THEIR terms. Elsewhere in presenting &#039;missionary judaism&#039; views, I think he stops short of saying Noachide laws are only 7 stepping-stones to being Jews; non-Jews now to be understood not on their various terms, but as &quot;not-yet-Jews&quot;?... Someone who is not aware of other &#039;non-proseltyzing&#039; Jewish views could read this as a hope and mission that the world only be comprised of one people - which given the depth and breadth of halakha - entails the destruction of the worlds peopleS as themselves. I am not a historian of the Catholic Church, but I do not think even Catholic Christianity, with the longest (and renounced), history of coercive conversion, conceived of so utterly eliminating the worlds nations AS nations.

About readings of Bible, I had meant really only regarding those doctrines I mentioned, not all of the parshanut (which definitely do not all consider each other to be kosher, even if reigning Orthodoxy does so now), versus evangelical Bible study; and I do think evangelicals/fundamentalists have the idea that other protestants may have other interpretations OF the &#039;word of God&#039; - and consider that those readings are wrong. That&#039;s part of how they have a million denominations within streams.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A response to Rabbi Riskin and Christian dialog.

I am new to this blog, but I would like to share my experience with Evangelical Christians, specifically those who are part of CUFI (Christians United for Israel).

After attending a local “night to honor Israel,” I sought ways to expand the interaction between the local Jewish community and the Christian supporters of Israel (both madinat Israel and am Israel).  I have been holding Jewish group “conversations” with members of a local congregation for over a year.  The conversations have ranged from Rosh Hashanah to History of Zionism to Jewish practices and beliefs regarding death and mourning.   There is no interest on either side to convert the other, but a very strong interest on the part of the Christians to get to know “us” better because we acknowledge the same divinity.

I have found that Jews and Christians, particularly fundamentalist Christians, have very different approaches to Biblical study and analysis.  For the Christian fundamentalist, the text, even in the King James’ version, is the absolute word of God.  For the Jew, even the most Orthodox, there is always another interpretation, or insight, even if it is deemed to be wrong or even heretical.  It does exist.

Many of my Jewish friends, both Orthodox and Reform, fear the Evangelical’s end game of the End of Days.  I think they are wrong.  I truly believe, based on my experiences that the philosemetic Christians really believe that God really meant what is stated in Genesis 12:3 and they don’t want to be cursed by our mutual God.
