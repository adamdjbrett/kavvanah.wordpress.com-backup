					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/yom-tov-sheni/#comment-1711&quot;&gt;H Sragow&lt;/a&gt;.

First of all, yom tov observance isn&#039;t just about whether or not you go to shul; someone could stay home and still be observing yom tov (or Shabbat) at home.

Second of all, a 2-day shul that wanted to become a 1-day shul would still have to do some things differently, beyond simply not having services on the 2nd day.  Certain practices that are specific to the 2nd day in 2-day communities (e.g. Simchat Torah, yizkor, Ruth) would be moved to the 1st (only) day.  If the 2nd day is on Shabbat, they would have regular Shabbat services that day instead of yom tov services.  If the shul has a daily minyan, they would have weekday services that day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No Breslau conference is necessary today, because  1-day observance does not require a different instutition to serve it.  It just requires that some people show up on the second day, and others don&#039;t.   You can watch it happening (or not happening) yourself, based on the proportion of open seats in the synagogue on Day 1 versus Day 2.   Similarly, the institution that serves the mass of people that show up on Saturday morning can also serve the trickle of stalwarts who show up for daily minyan.  

I actually saw Yom Tov Fatigue expressed not on Day 1 but on Day 3.  Several community members that would normally attend synagogue on shabbat, stayed home because they were &quot;shul-ed out.&quot;  Given the blur of experienced difference between your generic yom tov day service and the shabbat service, many people groan at the prospect of another 3 hours in shul.  It is not surprising that some drop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Breslau Conference of 1846 dealt with the issue from a rabbinical point of view and after dealing with the problem of Sabbath prohibitions.

My question is whether there was already a push by the laity in the 1820&#039;s? And was it driven by pragmatics? Were there local initiatives already before Breslau?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great question - I never thought about that before.  Yom tov sheini was repealed by the Breslau Conference of 1846.  The days of the week for Rosh Hashanah in years leading up to that were:
1830 Sat
1831 Thu
1832 Tue
1833 Sat
1834 Sat
1835 Thu
1836 Mon
1837 Sat
1838 Thu
1839 Mon
1840 Mon
1841 Thu
1842 Mon
1843 Mon
1844 Sat
1845 Thu
1846 Mon

(See &lt;a href=&quot;http://mahrabu.blogspot.com/2008/03/end-of-era.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for a key to what each configuration contains.)

So their time was much like ours:  they had recently gone from a weekend-holiday-rich era to a weekend-holiday-poor era.]]></description>
