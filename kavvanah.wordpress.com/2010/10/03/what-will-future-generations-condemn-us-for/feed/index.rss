					<description><![CDATA[I feel we’ll be condemned by our progeny for allowing Diaspora Judaism to disappear. We’ll be condemned for not stopping Israel from becoming  over time an undemocratic apartheid state. An apartheid state leads over time to a one state solution or endless strife. Either solution will create a reverse Zionism. I read there are already close to a million yordim. Third, though we can’t do much about the Russians, the old Likud people or even most Sefardim,  the settlers and the charedim are from circles close to ours. We have not done enough to stop these movements, each of which can have awful consequences for Israel. 
On the global level I agree with Appiah about the environment. I can’t get worked up over animal rights when we can’t stop genocide. The old people are interesting. Medicaid people are warehoused and many times live in the same facility with schizophrenics. It’s awful. All the rest, the children don’t call, or even fax…yes, but there are far bigger problems. In fact in one respect we are far too kind with old people. There are drugs that cost over $100,000 annually, and prolong life on average for 1-2 months. A large part of  Medicare is devoted to the final months in a person’s life. We can’t afford it. 

I think peak oil will bring us down before environmental apocalypse. You don’t need much…a 10%-20% absolute shortage, and the world economy is in big trouble. And the fight for resources will make life vicious. 

If it’s not one thing it’s another. As Roseanne Roseannadanna  used to say “Well, Jane, it just goes to show you, it&#039;s always something.&quot;]]></description>
