					<description><![CDATA[Is it not better to see the chazon ish as simply seeing the failure of musar to create moral people even to the degree of having a simple understanding of the difference between right and wrong and concluding that no one has so far not found a better solution that sitting and learning Gemara?
I do agree that it might have been deeper also. Perhaps the chazon Ish had discovered the vast underworlds inside the &quot;Self&quot; that he thought was better not to open up like some Pandora’s box.
 (I also think  that no one has found in the Jewish world anything  better or more powerful than Gemara  in terms of self improvement.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am disappointed that these accomplished scholars have descended, in written publication, to personal attack.  How much better it would have appeared had the aggrieved parties held their thoughts, settled the matter privately, and issued a joint communication about anything the public really needed to hear.  

I&#039;d suggest the editor would better serve his readers by suggesting the scholars share a pint of ale at the next academic conference.]]></description>
