Well, someone who listened to the series invited me recently to give the talk. So I was looking at some recent Conservative religious thought and here are some thoughts, specifically relating to Orthodox matters. They are not the content of my talk – they are are observations that loop back to things discussed here. These thoughts are impressions of an outsider and maybe over generalized. </p>
<p>For those who want some decent reading of where things are at and going- here are some good links. <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=4&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=623&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=3382&amp;TTL=The_Future_of_Conservative_Jewry">Arnold Eisen’s March 2010 vision for the movement,</a> <a href="http://www.shefanetwork.org/torah_resources">an assortments of current pulpit rabbis giving their important sermons (lots of good stuff in there)</a>, and <a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/11511/">the 2007 short visions for the movement.</a></p>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that the phrase Covenantal approach to Judaism has been gaining traction in the last three years. Covenantal meaning that there is an ongoing relationship with God and hearing God’s word. The traction is not in the name of the movement but in the thinking about applying tradition.There is a subtle shift from “tradition and change” or any legal theory of change to a relationship model. Many of the pulpit rabbis use the phrase to describe the uniqueness of the movement. Eisen speaks of going beyond the sovereign self to the broader commitments of covenant, mizvah, and community. In the debate between emphasizing the head or the heart, the winner seems to be emphasizing people&#8217;s lived narratives.<br />
Orthodox should not be projecting legal theory from prior eras onto contemporary Conservative rabbis. Human dignity and ongoing relationship with God is cited more than Catholic Israel.</p>
<p>Second, I noticed that the big tent is not spoken about anymore.  Rabbi Alan Silverman, one of the short list of candidates to be the new chancellor mentioned the need to going back to being a big tent that embraced the full spectrum of positions. That is distinctly absent from out Arnie Eisen’s rhetoric. Eisen did visit Hesder Yeshivot in his preparation year but did not go that route. I have also noticed a hesitancy about Talmud as a discipline from some of the speeches. Originally, the Conservative movement was focused on peoplehood with influence of Ahad Haam, Dubnow, and others. Someone started calling the movement halakhic in the 1980’s , (I suppose to compete with Centrism’s recent use of the term)That rhetoric has now shifted more to covenantal.  I am speaking about those official statements- those fellow travelers who do not affiliate are more likely to use the term- halakhic.</p>
<p>It is interesting that spirituality is tolerated but not part of anyone’s agenda. The bigger news is that everyone seems to now have caveats on the value of wissenschaft. Pure research in Jewish Studies is left for the university.  Now, scholarship has to be balanced by concern for people’s everyday lives. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, Marshall Sklare was the best analysis of the Conservative movement. It was a practical and pragmatic need to care for the masses of Eastern European immigrants guiding them in their Americanization and then suburbanization. There was nothing overly ideological about the movement. Sklare pointed out the lack of theory, consistency, or roots to Europe. Mordechai Waxman in his <em>Tradition and Change</em> also had a pragmatic understanding of the movement. One of the critiques that Orthodoxy had about the Conservative movement was that it was non-ideological and solely a pragmatic logic. Now, Orthodoxy invests the Conservative movement with an anachronistic heavy ideological mission from the first day. It seems that the debates between Reform and Orthodoxy in the 1840’s have been projected onto the Conservative movement. (I assume everyone has read Sklare and Waxman already).</p>
<p>But just as Reform and Orthodoxy were at their nadirs in 1970, I assume that Conservative movement will regain their traction after retooling. But the biggest question today that keeps coming up in discussions is that the best and brightest, those most committed to Torah study, prayer, and community work are not officially affiliating with the movement. There are many independent minyanim doing well, many political action groups, many dynamic young rabbis, and places like Hadar. Yet, there is a trend not to want to affiliate with the movement. The movement has an image of still too much old time suburban synagogue of the cantor leading everything, responsive reading, no spirit, no learning and still has a post WWII feel.  But there is a new active generation. </p>
<p>When I compare this to Centrist Orthodoxy, the moment of alienation was eclipsed by writing the past off. Back in the early 1980’s, the majority of Orthodox synagogues meant old synagogues in the Bronx, hundreds of small town synagogues in New England and the Midwest, synagogues in declining neighborhoods. Centrist Orthodoxy basically wrote them all off and focused on 10-12 major communities of professionals who send their kids to day schools and have possibly spent a year in Israel. Orthodoxy went from Shapiro’s wine to Cabernet Savignon, from clerks to physicians, and from old time Jews to the new heroic halakhic Jew. Yiddish, nostalgia, and looking backwards were jettisoned. Even synagogues where the former rabbis were important rabbis were ignored if they were in declining neighborhoods. The past was effaced and the word modern was temporarily dropped to be Centrist. No one had a problem doing this because the new generation was frum, learned, and correct in a way the old-timers were not.  No one in the creators of  Centrism had a problem with ignoring the old Jews in the old shuls. (They also ignored most of the West coast, allowing the vacuum to be filled by Chofetz Chayim, Chabad, and Ner Israel- but that is another story.)</p>
<p>To return to what I see, as an outsider, in the Conservative movement. The movement is still holding on to its old haunts and habits in Long island and North East so that the new generation has a disconnect. It still projects Chaim Potok more than contemporary novelists and artists. The movement has everything to gain by embracing all these new dynamic leaders, but they have no need to return to decay of the movement. So things appear less than the sum of the parts. As several of their leaders have noted there is no central organization for seeding and directing social planning. One thing we learned from watching the decline of the mainline churches is that any Church with valuable property like Episcopalians did better than Methodists with their suburban property. Carved Stone buildings in the city are more stable socially than modest wood buildings in the burbs. The movement has inertia.</p>
<p>Finally, the rise of websites like Kosher.com that delivers kosher food to anywhere, allows congregations to exist in communities without kosher butchers, bakeries, or kosher delis and pizza shops. Will that change the observance levels in way out of town communities? </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://http/www.rabbidavidrosen.net/bio.htm">Rabbi David Rosen</a> was the Jewish speaker at this years synod of Bishops, which was dedicated to the situation of Christians in the Middle East. Rosen was the former chief rabbi of Ireland, currently works as the interfaith representative from the AJC, is adviser to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and represents the State of Israel in interfaith dialogue. Rosen may be chosen by the ministry of religion and the chief Rabbinate but his views do not reflect those of the current foreign minister. He also holds a knighthood from the Vatican. Two years ago, the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, Rabbi Shaar Yashuv Cohen spoke at the synod of Bishops. Rabbi Cohen is currently, the de facto rabbinical decider (posek) for matters of interfaith.</p>
<p>In the speech, Rosen first speaks of the changed relationship from teaching of contempt to friendship. Then he speaks about the suffering of Christians in the Middle East (I skipped the political sections because I don’t want to debate politics). Rosen is adamant that  no one should have their dignity and rights taken away. He is glad that Israel has responded to pressure and returned some rights to clergy.  His big plea at the end is that events in middle east and the actions of the Israeli government should not be dampen relations between the faith. He quotes JPII that Judaism is intrinsic to Christianity.</p>
<p>Rabbi Rosen also quotes the Catholic catechism, discussed  here in the comments on the Rabbi Riskin post.  The section he cites is <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> (sect.839) :-&#8220;It is in pondering her own mystery that the Church, the People of God of the New Covenant, discovers her own profound bond with the Jews, who were chosen by the Lord before all others to receive His word.&#8221; Rabbi Rosen cites it from a specific speech of Pope Benedict where Benedict explains this quote as indicating that  &#8220;the Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God&#8217;s revelation&#8221;. This implies that Judaism already contains the Christian revelation but is a different response than the Christian response. The question is whether Judaism is a separate path for Jews or an incomplete version of Christianity. There is also the ambiguity if the mystery of God&#8217;s choosing the Jews is a positive contrast or a negative mystery of contrast. Either way, Christianity has been re-contextualized in Judaism.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http:///www.zenit.org/article-30646?l=english">writeup from Zenit, the News service from Rome.</a> Here is the <a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-30645?l=english">full transcript of the talk.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The  Jewish-Christian relationship and the Middle East<br />
</strong>by Rabbi David Rosen</p>
<p>The relationship today between Christianity and the Jewish people is a blessed transformation in our times &#8211; arguably without historic parallel. In his words in the great synagogue here in Rome last January, H.H. Pope Benedict XVI referred to the teaching of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council as &#8220;a clear landmark to which constant reference is made in our attitude and our relations with the Jewish people, marking a new and significant stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally this striking sea change in the way the Jewish people is viewed and presented , still had and has to contend with the influence of centuries, if not millenia of the &#8220;teaching of contempt&#8221; towards Jews and Judaism, which obviously is not eliminated overnight nor even over forty five years. Accordingly the impact of this transformation in Catholic-Jewish relations varies considerably from one context to another. Arguably the most dramatic internalization has taken place in the United States of America where Jews and Christians live in an open society side by side as vibrant self-confident and civically engaged minorities. As a result the relationship has advanced there to a unique degree involving cooperation and exchanges between the communities and their educational institutions; and today the US boasts literally dozens of academic institutions for Catholic-Jewish studies and relations, while there are perhaps three in the rest of the world. Indeed there is a widespread perception among the Jewish communities in the US of the Catholic Church as a genuine friend with profound values and interests in common.</p>
<p>However there are many countries where the abovementioned social and demographic factors are not present. In most countries where Catholicism is the dominant social force, Jewish communities are small if present at all, and the relationship between the Church and Judaism often gets little notice. I confess to having been surprised to find Catholic clergy and sometimes even hierarchy from some countries, who are not only remarkably ignorant about Judaism, but often even about <em>Nostra Aetate</em> itself and the relevant teachings of the <em>Magisterium</em> concerning Jews and Judaism.</p>
<p>While as indicated, Jewish experience in the US has done much to alleviate negative impressions of the tragic past; there is still widespread ignorance about Christianity in the Jewish world &#8211; especially where there is little or no contact at all with modern Christians.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the plight of Palestinians generally and Palestinian Christians in particular should be of profound concern to Jews both in Israel and the Diaspora.</p>
<p>To begin with, especially as Judaism brought to the world the recognition that every human person is created in the Divine Image; and that accordingly, as the sages of the Talmud teach, any action of disrespect for another person, is an act of disrespect for the Creator himself; we have a special responsibility for our immediate neighbors.<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Below is Rosen&#8217;s well-crafted pitch not to let politics interfere with interfaith relations which is combined with a push to attain greater clarity from the Vatican on the role of Judaism within their theology. Rosen frames the discussion in such a way as to bracket out the more restrictive voices and to push for a stronger theological acceptance of Judaism. He also uses some of the words of JPII to push for an expansive reading of the catechism. The bold was in the version that I received.</p>
<blockquote><p>However the <em>Instrumentum Laboris</em> commenting on <em>Dei Verbum</em> describes the dialogue of  the Church &#8220;with her <em>elder brothers</em>&#8221; as not just necessary, but as &#8220;essential&#8221; (sect.87). Indeed in his visit to the great synagogue in this city this year, Pope Benedict XVI quoted the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> (sect.839) :-<br />
&#8220;It is in pondering her own mystery that the Church, the People of God of the New Covenant, discovers her own profound bond with the Jews, who were chosen by the Lord before all others to receive His word&#8221; ;  and added that &#8220;the Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God&#8217;s revelation&#8221;.<br />
These words echo those of the late Pope John Paul II who in his historic visit to the same central Jewish place of worship in this city in 1986 declared that &#8220;the Jewish religion is not <em>extrinsic </em>to us but in a certain way is <em>intrinsic</em> to our own religion.<br />
With Judaism therefore we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion.&#8221;<br />
Furthermore in his Apostolic Exhortation of June 28<sup>th</sup> 2003 he described <strong>&#8220;dialogue and cooperation with believers of the Jewish religion&#8221;</strong> as being<strong> &#8220;fundamentally important for the self-knowledge of Christians&#8221; in keeping with the Synod&#8217;s call &#8220;for acknowledgment of the common roots linking Christianity and the Jewish people, who are called by God to a covenant which remains irrevocable&#8221;</p>
<p>As I have indicated, I am fully cognizant of the fact that the political realities in the Middle East do not always make it easy for Christians to acknowledge let alone embrace these exhortations. However I pray that the miracle of what John Paul II referred to as </strong>&#8220;the flowering of a <strong>new springtime in mutual relations&#8221; will increasingly become evident in the Middle East, as throughout the world.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/9618">Here is the WJC write-up</a> emphasizing the political.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=191629">Jpost article:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>the Sunni representative, Muhammad al-Sammak, political councilor to the mufti of Lebanon<br />
Asked whether he agreed with Rosen’s statement that Christians could become “blessed peacemakers in the city whose name means peace,” the Lebanese political councilor replied, “I subscribe blindly to anything said by Rabbi David Rosen.”</p></blockquote>

				<p>For my Hebrew readers, there are several recent articles on college that came out this week in Israel. They offer an interesting parallel to the American debates. Dr. Aviad HaCohen defends the academic enterprise against those who blames the ills of society on college such as R. Avraham Wasserman of Yeshivat Ramat Gan. And there is a great interview with Rabbi Shabbtai Rapaport of the Bar-Ilan Kollel on how the college can have both religious and non-religions and that it creates a respect for the Jewish tradition teaching that Judaism is not for the Datiim alone. That he has no problem bringing Academic tools into the study hall. And the section quoted below is a little diatribe against the ignorance of our age.</p>
<p>The h/t goes to<a href="http://ravtzair.blogspot.com/2010/10/blog-post_13.html"> Rav Tzair</a> and here is a quote from his post with the links.</p>
<blockquote><p>.לפני כמה ימים הצצתי באתר כיפה וראיתי <a href="http://www.kipa.co.il/family/show.asp?id=40486">מאמר של ד&#8221;ר אביעד  הכהן</a> שבו הוא תוקף את:<br />
ניסיונם  של כמה רבנים, שהדי דבריהם נשמעו באחרונה ברמה, לתלות את כל חוליי החברה  הדתית בלימודים האקדמיים.  <a href="http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1193105.html">לראיון  שהתפרסם באתר הארץ עם הרב אברהם וסרמן</a>, ר&#8221;מ בישיבת רמת-גן ורב קהילה  בגבעתיים, על <a href="http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/images/eti.jpg">מאמר  שהוא כתב בעלון &#8220;עולם קטן&#8221;</a> כנגד יתר האקדמיזציה הפושה בציבור.</p>
<p>&#8211;  עם או בלי קשר לידיעה הקודמת, היום <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3967625,00.html">התפרסם  באתר YNET ראיון עם מו&#8221;ר הרב שבתי רפפורט</a>, העומד כיום בראש המכון הגבוה  לתורה (הידוע בכינויו &#8220;הכולל&#8221;) של אוניברסיטת בר-אילן. אני בטוח שלא מעט  מתלמידיו יתקשו להאמין שהוא אמר את המשפט הבא:<br />
זו אוניברסיטה שמנסה לחנך. היא לא פונה רק אל השכל, אלא  גם אל הלב ואל ההכרה וזה האופי המיוחד שלה. המסר שעובר כל הזמן הוא  חשיבותה של המורשת היהודית. וכל הזמן , תוך כדי, לא דוחים אף אחד. לא  אומרים לאף אחד בגלל זה אתה לא יכול ללמוד כאן, אלא אומרים אנחנו  אוניברסיטה שהתורה עניין מרכזי בה, בוא ותראה. בבר אילן את התפיסה הזו  נושמים באויר.<br />
(לשם ההגינות אבהיר שאני לא זוכר אי פעם שהרב שבתי  התבטא כנגד לימודים בבר-אילן או בכל מוסד אקדמאי אחר)<br />
הראיון מסתיים  במשפט שהוא מאד מאד משקף את האיש:<br />
אני חושב שהחיסרון הגדול של דורנו זו הבורות שנובעת מחוסר חשיפה  לתורה. זו אינה בורות של חוסר ידיעה, אלא מתוך הכרה שזה יהיה לי קשה. אני  חושב ששונאי ישראל האשימו אותנו בהרבה דברים, אבל אף פעם לא בטיפשות. עם  ישראל הוא עם חכם. אני חושב שצריך לפתח את תחום התורה והאמונה והמורשת ולא  רק ללמוד אותם. יש לנו מחויבות להוריש לדור הבא משהו עשיר יותר ממה  שקיבלנו.</p></blockquote>

				<p>These are notes to myself on a new book that will be required in courses on the topic. If you have an interest n theory of relgion read on, if not wait for me to post a less academic post.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich_Beck">Ulrich Beck</a> offers a social definition of the changes of religion in the last decades. Why is it an era of post-secularization? And why does that make orthodoxies a good choice. Let me know what you think about his theories.  I received a pre-publication copy and am still digesting it, so there will be more personal comments in an eventual part II. (I assume ej ordered a copy when I gave him advance notice in a comments thread.)</p>
<p>This is the one book to read this year about religion in the world.  Ulrich Beck, an important German sociologist of globalization, cosmopolitanism, and secondary modernity has written a synthesis of the various works on post-secularism of the last decade. He integrates Habermas’ allowing religion into the public sphere,  Jose Casanova’s critique and reformulation of secularization,  the gang over at Immanent Frame (Charles Taylor, Talal Asad, Arjun Appadurai et al)along with  the sociology of Zymunt Bauman, Anthony Giddens, and Pierre Bourdeau.  This book is almost a summary study of the writings on religion of the last decades and into the future. Beck is <a href="http://www.barcelonametropolis.cat/en/page.asp?id=21&amp;ui=72">interviewed often</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/2-10-2006-88579.asp">has many quotable quotes.</a> (There are many more interviews out there.)</p>
<p>Beck&#8217;s opening point is clear. Most sociology of religion has been functional and accepting. They explain why people have beliefs without judging the value of the beliefs. Sociologists are equally open- minded toward any manifestation of religion -new age, Evangelicals, revivalism, and magic.  Beck argues that we need a sociology of the effect of religion on society and to examine the cultural productivity and destructiveness of religious beliefs. The contents of religious beliefs  as an “autonomous force and reality, their vision of a different humanity and their power to make whole worlds tremble, are so rarely exposed in their full ambivalence to the gaze of sociology.” Beck is a confirmed European secularist, yet he seeks to capture the power and hold that religion has today.</p>
<p>Beck&#8217;s conclusion about contemporary religion is that everyone has a” God of one’s own.” This God is not an omnipotent God, rather God needs mans help to be acknowledged and to make the world a better place.  God himself is “impotent and helpless in an apocalyptic age” We turn to God to seek solace and dignity not safety or solutions.“We wish to chain our personal God to our own desires, traumas, hysterias, fears and hopes and at the same time, we want to keep these chains in our own hands.”  (13)</p>
<p>Beck considers taking refuge in dogmas of faith that are incompatible with our “individualized experiences and ambivalent feelings” is a form of self-deception- it fails to acknowledge individualism. Rather one needs to recognize the empirical and historical fact that the  <strong>God of one’s own correspond to the space of one’s own life and life of one’s space.</strong> Man is at the same time believer and God. Modern life is fragmented with an alterity of own’s own life. (15) One’s own life is another name for the contingent and reflexive nature of that life </p>
<p>Beck declares that the collapse of secularization theory is greater than fall of the Soviet Union (21). Heavily reliant of the essays that Habermas wrote in 2007 – 2008, Beck declares a post-secular age. orthodox and conservative religions are gaining ground everywhere. (24) The new religious movements are based on changing psychological schools cobbled together to form Gods of their own. Asian and archaic elements are accepted by even the  most modernized people. (27)</p>
<p>The visit of Pope Benedict to the US or Britain was a mass media event of papacy- a cosmopolitan event. It filled no churches and does not stop decline but it becomes a major cultural event even for atheists. God in the age of technical reproduction is adapted for mass media- there is an aura given by  the Pope (37-8)</p>
<p>Beck is one of the leading theoreticians of globalization. Habermas’ reflexive modernity (and Bauman&#8217;s liquid modernity) is defined by Beck as having three elements &#8211; <strong>risk society, individualization, and cosmopolitanism.</strong> Beck prefers the term cosmopolitanism to that of globalization since there is an  erosion of clear boundaries, an  involuntary confrontation with the other, and a new need for a hermeneutic of the other. (67-8) This time it is a choice of enriching mutual recognition or violence.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmopolitanism</strong> is defined as a product of powerful economic, political, and mass media developments at the start of the 21st century. There is a simultaneous abolishment of older boundaries between people and the creation of new ones. Erased are the old boundaries , the new overrides the pre-existing hierarchies of class, caste, exclusion. In turn, it creates new boundaries of violence and tolerance or new sets of competing religious universalism or a dualism of good and evil that withholds dignity to outsiders.  (52-54)</p>
<p><strong>Individualization</strong> does not mean Bellah’s individual, and egoistic choice, nor is it Enlightenment autonomy  and it is not the market’s conscious choice or individual preference.(see Anthony Giddens and Zygmunt Bauman).Individualization is imposed on the individual. There are no more specific roles in a marriage, ways to act at work, or paths in life. Until recently, men were the legal bread winner and women had to cook. Now that that is not legally mandated, Individualization is the process of deciding in a marriage of the routine of chores, roles, place to live, finances.  A similar need for choice, negotiation, decision making applies to all aspects of our lives. </p>
<p>The third element <strong>risk society</strong> is to recognize that these changes are not better nor worse (Giddens vs Toraine), rather that we are forever seeking to minimize or deal with risk in our lives. Individualization creates risk. We live on a circus high wire act trying to balance marriage-divorce, several jobs over the course of a life, self-praise and marketing, the need to be flexible and resilient to change. We always have risk and are making decisions – evening meal, insurance, who takes out the trash, old age, medical decisions,  university training, what house to buy, who to have as neighbors. There is a new immediacy to our lives  and we need to make choices<br />
<strong>Here is where religion comes in—submission to orthodoxy is part of a strategy of decreasing risk- The effect of religion in the public sphere is to help mediate risk society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beck’s core thesis about religion</strong> in an age of cosmopolitanism: 1] religious belief spreads in proportion to insecurity 2] religious subjective anarchy of new age, spirituality, pop psych&#8211; churches have made their peace with it 3] Religion is similar to individualization of family and social classes  4] Religion has broken away  from an elite or priestly model -people write the religion in their own words 5] It is a fallacy to link declining membership and lack of commitment to any form of decline in relgion or secularization. People are interested in religion in their own terms, even without membership or commitment. (85ff)</p>
<p>Individualization creates a God of one’s vision outside of  church- against the secure backdrop of the welfare state and modern technology. Religion is  an empowering of the believing individual who with the aid of doctrine creates commonality with others that creates new borders. </p>
<p>Authority is based on personal commitment. But the asking for individual commitment blurs lines of church and self.  (The old kehilah system or even the synagogue system of the 1950’s no one asked if you wanted to join or for any personal commitment).</p>
<p>Originally, we had doctrines, rules and rites and then we asked a second order question who is a Christian? Doctrines were universals, differences of individuals were not considered. Now in the age of cosmopolitanism, we ask who is a Christian? and then what are the doctrines and rites?</p>
<p>[For a Jewish equivalent, <strong>we used to ask what does Judaism say or require? Then ask who buys into it?</strong> Individual lack of commitment did not play a great role. Now we ask Who is Orthodox? And then determine the lines of the doctrines and practices. <strong>Commitment comes before the system.</strong> There used to be starting universals like peoplehood, yiddishkeit, or even  to follow torah and mizvos, now we start with particulars.] </p>
<p><strong>And now that everything is a  matter of personal commitment then we deny dignity to others who don’t share our belief.</strong> If I believe then you are wrong, then there is no philosophy, institution, or universal that transcends my belief.  Religions today are more exclusive specifically because they are more personal and based on commitment.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, people thought that religion was certain knowledge against the egoistic individualism of what Bellah called “Sheilaism.” Now, from a post-secular perspective, all the individual commitments to Evangelicalism, Orthodox Judaism, revivalism, and spirituality are all forms of personalized commitment similar in content to Sheilaism, but good for risk management in an age of forced individualism.</p>
<p>To be continued in part II with tolerance and  the political elements of religion.</p>
<p>In the meantime any thoughts?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>This is a first draft. Not completely thought through so it may change in a few days. I am not wedded to any section, so I may retract whole sections. Yet, I think there is something here.</p>
<p>When I first started this blog, the New York Times Sunday book review had an issue dedicated to the 1930’s depression featuring books about the attitudes toward the downtrodden masses . Many of the opinions featured corresponded to the positions of the Conservative rabbis of the era and their decision for the law to respond the masses.  (My thoughts on the 1930&#8217;s will show up in a more professional venue, eventually). This week’s New York Times book review has two articles about the Tea Partiers.  As I read those articles, it sounded much like the rhetoric on the orthodox blogs and orthodox editorials which blame the Rabbinic administration for the high cost of yeshiva tuition.  It seems like we are heading for some form of Tea Partying about rabbinic authority. </p>
<p>It seems that the economic difficulties are generating a sense of outage that is taken out on the current leadership, in our case day school administrators. The important line in the book review is that “the objects of their outcries …are of far less consequence than the great failures that plague the nation.” There are problems and the objects of anger are not the cause. So the question is: When will there be a Rabbinic leader who is playing  a tea-partier role?  Since we have had rabbis in the 1950&#8217;s hunting communists, in the 1960’s wearing Dashikis, in the 70’s advocating “do your own thing”  in the 1980’s cozying up to the Moral Majority, becoming libertarians in the 1990&#8217;s, and rabbis sounding like Evangelicals today, then it is only a matter of time until we start hearing Tea Partier sermons about Rabbinic leadership.</p>
<p>People are angry that they cannot afford to live the frum lifestyle they want, because if one is frum then one is guaranteed the lifestyle. Someone has to be at fault. If you create a community that requires the members to be in the top 6% of US income, and makes one comfortable only if one is in the top 3% then you have a social problem.  The objects of blame are a side show, but if the blogs are an indication then there is some of the blame is being placed on leadership. </p>
<p>From the NYT</p>
<blockquote><p>Anatomy of an Uprising By ALAN BRINKLEY		October 8, 2010<br />
Listening to the many and diverse demands and ideas that the Tea Partiers express in their rallies, pamphlets and oratory does relatively little to explain why so many Americans are so angry… Similar outbreaks of outrage and blame have accompanied most major economic crises over the last century and more….  The Great Depression produced multiple movements that reviled the power of bankers and the concentration of wealth. In both cases, as in our own time, the movements soon became immersed in innumerable other grievances and prejudices.<br />
The Tea Partiers are right to be angry. But the objects of their outcries …are of far less consequence than the great failures that plague the nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let me recount another Sukkot story.  We had as a guest an NCSY BT from the 1970’s who is RW MO, as are his kids. He now lives in an agudah neighborhood somewhere in the US where 4 bedroom houses cost 180, 000. He was complaining that the synagogues here in Teaneck don’t allow drinking. He was adamant in his declaration that: who do the rabbis think they are telling us what to do! Rabbis have no right to forbid anything! He proclaimed that the tradition to drink on Simchat Torah goes back to the Gemara since the gemara says we do birchat Kohanim at Shararit because the kohanim will be drunk  by mussaf. (I did not correct him about the Gemara or tell him what the Mishnah Berurah actually says, it was too good of a diatribe). Over the course of the meal, he complained about NY orthodox, its day schools, and the cost of living in the NY community. There was a sense of the Torah being one thing and the Rabbis as administrators as another. There was also a sense of how alienated some parts of out of town Orthodoxy are from the NYC enclaves.</p>
<p>There is a certain distrust of the elites in America and so too in certain parts of Orthodoxy. Many people feel outside or looking up at the elites who are disconnected from their lives.  And many want freedom – a core value in America. Our enclaves are conformist and dont hear their needs.  </p>
<blockquote><p>The Beat Generation and the Tea Party   Lee Siegal<br />
Still, American dissent turns on a tradition of troublemaking, suspicion of elites and feelings of powerlessness, no matter where on the political spectrum dissent takes place.<br />
Like the Beats, the Tea Partiers are driven by that maddeningly contradictory principle, subject to countless interpretations, at the heart of all American protest movements: individual freedom. The shared DNA of American dissent might be one answer to the question of why the Tea Partiers, so extreme and even anachronistic in their opposition to any type of government, exert such an astounding appeal.<br />
More seriously, the origin of the word “beat” has a connection to the Tea Partiers’ sense that they are being marginalized as the country is taken away from them. According to Ginsberg, to be “beat” most basically signified “exhausted, at the bottom of the world, looking up or out . . . rejected by society.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are people out there who fell that they are not represented in the Rabbinic elite, just like Tea Partier’s have  “a feeling that their opinions are not represented in Washington.” This movement or moment is likely to come from the right wing side – a call to follow Torah and not Rabbinical organizations, Rabbinical administrations, and the politics generated by rabbis. (It will probably still deeply respect Gedolim, Zaddikim, and Rabbinic authority in general-just not the political manifestations of lower levels of the hierarchy.)</p>
<p>In the past when there was an economic gap and a blaming of the Rabbinic leadership it led to varied results. In the 1740’s, there was a critique of Rabbinic leadership and the newly wealthy and new lands of Podolyia created Hasidism. People broke from the Kehillah to form shiblach. In the 1880’s, it lead to a variety of secular solutions that fled the Rabbinate to Zionism, Socialism, Bund, Folks Party. The story of Kotso shel  Yod by Yehudah Leib Gordon  conveys a sense of the alienation. By 1921, it lead to young Rabbis choosing the Mizrahi movement that preached job training, education for productivity, and secular studies. The Great Depression created a generation of Conservative rabbis who spoke of social realism and helping the masses.</p>
<p>Now, what will come from the economic crisis of the last few years.  There will certainly be the creation of Orthodox communities that allow one to make lower than the top 6% of income. Centrism may be cast as having been a rich man’s religion. But the interesting point is that the blaming of the Rabbis as an object of scorn for the economic difficulties will lead to a distancing from the seemingly aloof rabbis. (It does not matter if it is true at all, just that it is perceived that way).</p>
<p>Now from where will the change occur? There are three choices: (1)the places with 180K homes far from NY who are alienated from the economics and education required for Centrism. (2) the new places in the Sun belt devoid of seminaries, rabbinic elite, and direct contact with the North (3) the heart of places such as Bergenfield where the economic inequities are being felt. This corresponds to (1)Those who fundamentally disenfranchised from the community  (2)Those in a new place without a strong leadership base (3) those in the center who feel the greatest dissidence and that their expectations not met. Hasidism started in a place like the second choice, Secularism, Bund, and Mizrahism in the third, but those leader found fertile ground for their ideas in the first group.</p>
<p>Let me know when you start hearing from some young Rabbi who thinks we need to scale back Rabbinic authority or that the Rabbinical supervised enclave is not needed. Not a liberal Orthodox Rabbi who never had a strong sense of authority, rather someone who has a tea-party rhetoric against the elites who are not concerned for the needs of the people. Look to the right not the left. Someone with Tea Party politics and a strong sense of Torah.</p>
<p>I am not interested in discussing American politics, rather to gather the voices of the new Jewish generation. </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There is a major under-reported story that will effect Jewish religion in America.<br />
Hebrew College in Boston just announced that their 32 million dollar debt has been renegotiated. (<strong>see Update below</strong>) <a href="http:///www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/10/hebrew_college_says_deal_will_cut_32m_debt/">see here</a> and <a href="http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/hebrew-colleges-32m-windfall/">here.</a> <a href="http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2009/12/14/story1.html">This is where they were 10 months ago.</a>. </p>
<p>Rabbi Daniel L. Lehmann, the college president who is a YU musmach, took over in 2008 to a 32 million debt left by the previous administration. The institution did not meet the interest payments the year Lehman took over and paid operating costs on credit. They will enter 2011 with a clean slate. he was able to do this in the midst of a recession. This will give Lehmann and the Rabbinical school headed by Arthur Green an ability to emerge as the premier non-orthodox non-denominational rabbinical school. (This makes Lehmann into one of the top fundraisers out there right now &#8211; worthy of the comparison to Norman Lamm who renegotiated YU&#8217;s debt and then raised funds to make YU one of the wealthier institutions.- <strong>see update that negates this line.</strong>)  Currently JTS remains with a much smaller debt, but one that it cannot get out from under.<br />
If Lehmann can keep this up, he can design from almost scratch any type of new Jewish institution he wants. One not tied to any denomination or burdensome institutional tradition. Knowing his track record, he will succeed. He built the new Jewish HS in Boston from scratch.<br />
The Rabbinical school under Green will definitely draw students from HUC JTS, and RRC. We will see if he makes a pitch to attract liberal YU students like himself.  His interests include music- he is likely to develop the existing music program. Expect his 2011 graduation-end of year speech to give a vision of where he is taking the institution and American Jewry.</p>
<p><strong>Update-</strong> It seems that Hebrew College had to give up the building to pay off the debt. 32 million was not raised, rather they gave to the banks the ill conceived building that Gordis built. There is still no clear indication if the building was repossessed or if there is a lease to stay at that location. (I should know not to trust Rabbinical school announcements about their finances, oh well. ) If they vacate, where will they go? I stil have fond memories of their former location in a run-down mansion in Brookline. So, it shows strong leadership and does not show massive fund raising. Either way- they are now free to build Jewish programs when other seminaries are strapped for cash.</p>

				<p>This speech tic of speaking of the new generation is not going away so fast.<br />
There is a new Avi Chai Report:<br />
<a href="http://www.avi-chai.org/generation.pdf"> Generation of Change: How Leaders in Their Twenties and Thirties Are Reshaping American Jewish Life</a></p>
<p>Much of the results is old hat already and the write up has too much of Jack Wertheimer&#8217;s preaching rather than Steve Cohen&#8217;s sociology.<br />
The report introduces three types of activities: <strong>protective, progressive, and expressive.</strong> They are also working with a clear divide between establishment and non-establishment.  Since I filled out the survey form, from their write-up it seems that my answers were included in the statistics for the older establishment group. 🙂</p>
<blockquote><p>
Organized Jewish life in the second half of the twentieth century was focused around protective activities&#8230;<br />
It is simply not true, as some contend, that younger Jewish leaders want nothing to do with these organizations and their protective causes. Many do, especially among those who are socioeconomically more secure and relate positively to the networking culture of the established Jewish organizations; political and religious propensities also dispose some younger leaders to identify with protective causes.</p>
<p>Two other agendas are simultaneously at work among young leaders. “Progressive” causes appeal to some: Jewish leaders involved with start-ups are especially apt to identify with broader social causes—environmentalism, service to the downtrodden (mainly non-Jews), and a variety of social justice causes, including what they regard as justice for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>The third agenda might be labeled expressive: Young Jewish leaders want to help their peers find personal meaning in being Jewish. There has been an explosion of interest in Jewish culture—including everything from foods of various Jewish communities to an interest in Jewish languages and folkways to a celebration of Jewish books, music, film, and other artistic productions. A small but noteworthy minority is drawn to experimental forms of Jewish religious expression, usually found outside of conventional synagogues. And more broadly, younger Jewish leaders have created a wide range of opportunities for their peers (and others) to study Torah, explore spiritual questions, and probe what being Jewish means to them.</p>
<p>The emphasis leaders place on protective, progressive, and expressive types of Jewish activities sets groups apart from one another. Put differently, the mix of these three elements shapes the particular culture of organizations for young Jewish adults, whether they are sponsored by establishment organizations or non-establishment ones.</p>
<p>Nonestablishment Programs: Over the past ten to 15 years, a large network of new programs and institutions has been<br />
created by Jews in their 20’s and 30’s. These so-called start-ups tend to be characterized by the following:<br />
1. They do not hesitate to question the status quo.<br />
2. They seem highly attuned to their clients—younger Jews.<br />
3. They experiment.<br />
4. They network with one another and arrive at<br />
innovative solutions.<br />
5. They have the agility to associate seemingly unrelated<br />
fields and causes.</p></blockquote>
