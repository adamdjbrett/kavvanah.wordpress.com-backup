Rav Lichtenstein is 77 (pardon the anachronism, he was born on Yom Yerhushalayim, 1933).
Those of us who remember him when he was younger (i.e., even at age 70) realize that he&#039;s much slower. Nevertheless, the amount of work he does to this day is astounding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rav Lichtenstein is not only growing older but he has always had a conservative bent and as an earlier poster mentioned, a preference for analysis over position.
His son however, Rav Mosheh Lichtenstein, is of a different nature. Not as well-known in America, it would be good to see his profile increase, as he is  unafraid to speak his mind and give more definitive often provocative answers to the sorts of questions mentioned above.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see an inflation of corrective measures: first day school was supposed to &quot;do the trick&quot;, then yeshiva in Israel, now stay away from college, who knows what they&#039;ll think of next - all the while having to become more and more wealthy to support all of these crown jewels (many institutions are much less than that).
Maybe nothing works, and Orthodoxy is actually doing no better than it ever did. Which of course is terrible, thanks for asking, becuase Orthodoxy needs crises to survive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how much of the shock at &quot;getting old&quot; and feeling the community shifting is a result of the changes, and how much from the breaking of an implicit promise. The return to Orthodoxy was billed as a return to &quot;Judaism Eternal,&quot; and the assimilation (and intermarriage) of earlier generations was attributed to ignorance of Judaism -- which day schools (and then yeshiva in Israel) promised to correct.

In other words, we did everything right. Why isn&#039;t it working?

My inner Hirschian wonders whether the failure of this generation’s Jewish education to keep kids frum is correlated with the displacement of Hirschian ethical and universal values by the parochial and particularistic. Is today’s Jewish education the same as it was back in the ’70s and early ’80s?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just came from a session with rabbis in Chicago and Rav Lichtenstein. While this was supposed to be questions and answers, it was really one question with a follow up. The question centered around Motti Elon and the controversey.
Yes, Rav Aaron is frail, and you have to listen carefully, but he was extraordinary in describing the complexities, his own personal feelings, and in his wonderful way of  not giving a simple yes or no response. He spoke with empathy and supported people&#039;s internal conflicts. He remains a treasure to the Orthodox community.]]></description>
