I&#039;m sorry, but I have to say I don&#039;t agree that the CHURCHES have made peace with New-Age etc&#039;. The people have made peace with it, about that I agree with you. That&#039;s true, and that fits what I said &quot;it&#039;s the belief that counts, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s not who you believe in that matters&quot;.

That&#039;s also why I don&#039;t agree that &quot;because people speak of commitment, becoming a BT, letting God in their heart then they become justified exclusivists&quot;. Quite the contrary, at least many times. I mean, is it not strange that they have become justified exclusivists when they want to combine Christ and Yoga? If the former, Mohler would not have received a thousand calls an hour from those who combine Evangelical belief and Yoga.

And thanks for the explanation of the final paragraph.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/ulrich-beck-a-god-of-one%e2%80%99s-own/#comment-1766&quot;&gt;tomerpersico&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;maybe i missed something, but... what&#039;s the name of the book?&lt;/em&gt;

A God of One&#039;s Own.
&lt;em&gt;
 i simply don&#039;t see some of the things Beck says. like &quot;religious subjective anarchy of new age, spirituality, pop psych– churches have made their peace with it&quot;. i think definitely not. here is a recent example: http://www.albertmohler.com/2010/09/20/the-subtle-body-should-christians-practice-yoga/&lt;/em&gt;

Evangelical rhetoric is entirely subjective and has the same subjective qualities as new age-even if they are calling the new age pagan. Mohler is at this point the exception that proves the rule. Mohler is about the only religious leader in the US who has not even made his peace with Jewish-Christian dialogue. But that is why Mohler gets all the press these days, the newspapers can always count on him the say something opposite and opposed to whatever they are writing about. Mohler states that he received a thousand calls an hour from those who combine Evangelical belief and Yoga, so he has hit a nerve in the flock. Even when opposing it his own Christianity is pretty subjective. Personally, I liked his essay on Yoga. I dont think it is value neutral.

&lt;em&gt;and &quot;Religions today are more exclusive specifically&quot;??? what about Peter Berger&#039;s consistant talk about religious people having to be pluralists since they meet the neighbor and discover that although he does not worship the same god, shucks, he&#039;s a really nice guy? i&#039;m with Berger in this one: it&#039;s the belief that counts, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s not who you believe in that matters&lt;/em&gt;.

This is where Beck adds to Berger. It is not just he is a nice guy and we all picked our religious paths so we know it is contingent and provisional. No, because people speak of commitment, becoming a BT, letting God in their heart then they become justified exclusivists. Their own emotions and volition provides an absolute truth that negates the truth of others.

&lt;em&gt;and a question: i could not understand this (i feel) important paragraph:
&quot;[For a Jewish equivalent, we used to ask what does Judaism say or require? Then ask who buys into it? Individual lack of commitment did not play a great role. Now we ask Who is Orthodox? And then determine the lines of the doctrines and practices. Commitment comes before the system. There used to be starting universals like peoplehood, yiddishkeit, or even to follow torah and mizvos, now we start with particulars.]&quot;
could you explain?
&lt;/em&gt;
Becks point is that we used to define our religion based on the group, the tradition, doctrine and other universals that transcend the self. For example, the synagogue and rabbi are Orthodox- then with that objective standard in place I identify with it. But my own beliefs and practices are secondary to that of the external group. Someone belongs to the group, if they accept the external universal. Now, people make personal commitments which are private and subjective and then and only then look to the the dogma and rites which I personally affirm. It is like someone committing to become a Baal Teshuvah or to become Orthodox and then defining the religion and definitions based on the personal experience of commitment.
In the Certau sense- relgion is first a private language and then an external doctrine or practice. Or in the Foucault sense, religion used to be without an author. Now every religious doctrine, law, ritual, or practice has an author.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did buy the book, thank you very much. I just don’t know enough to fully appreciate what’s going on. Here is my first impressionistic take away on  Beck and the Jewish Problem. Beck’s descriptions of individualism –personal God either already exist (Liberal Judaism) or are unacceptable(Orthodoxy). Halacha, ask a ruv, group conformity take away much of the alleged difficulty in creating an autonomous self. More important for the Jewish world  is his idea that religions must/will  become cosmopolitan, and accept gracefully living in one space with others who have different conceptions of value and morality, all the while not succumbing to an all embracing relativism. The Pope has expressed similar sentiments.
What happens then when we transpose this theme to intra-Jewish conflicts? We Jews are flirting with a full schism between those who are Orthodox and those who are otherwise. Even the most radical charedi knows life would become much more difficult should the secular disappear. If we are not to schism, the question then becomes how can we create a cosmopolitan Jewish world?  How can we  create a civil, accepting, open society, though with different religious beliefs? To preach as Beck does that it is happening everywhere is not a prescription what to do when it is vehemently rejected by the Orthodox and in a way by secular Jewish society as well . 
A second application is the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Even if we accept Beck’s main thesis that nations are soo yesterday, what follows? It’s really a variation of the EU argument…we are trying to break down national barriers, so why can’t the Israelis follow? The idea is a non starter. Perhaps Beck might be useful in thinking about partial one state solutions. Suppose there is no Palestinian state, all negotiations fail. Is it possible to create some in-between fractal state, that would improve the position of the Palestinians while not traumatizing the Jews. Imagine Bernard Avishai’s vision of  two city states building vertically, but now only Jews have a vote on national issues. Add to this undemocratic situation a free market in land and real estate. Both  Palestinians and Jews can live anywhere they so please, and let the market work it all out. We now have a non- democratic but also a non- apartheid state, with the economic freedoms that would exist in a full democracy.  The EU countries have not merged in all respects. They have one currency, but other policy variables are still run by the individual nations. What they have are open borders. Maybe a Beckish solution would be to  stop thinking exclusively about territory and start thinking about integrating functions.]]></description>
