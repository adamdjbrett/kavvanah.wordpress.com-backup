					<description><![CDATA[I believe you are correct when you assert that the enlightenment did not, &quot;defeat superstition&quot;. I do however think, and I hope you can agree, that it transitioned us out of using religious reasoning for many matters. Especially ethics, from Spinoza to Kant&#039;s deontological system of ethics. If you were to ask the average person on the street why he does not murder his neighbor, the answer will be more fulfilling than, &quot;because the Bible tells me so&quot;. 

Regarding the future of religion in the US and the world, I recommend (if you have not read them already) &quot;The Evolution of God&quot; by Robert Wright and &quot;Breaking the Spell: Religion as a natural phenomenon&quot; by Daniel Dennett.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dr. Brill! The review works better with the introduction. 

As for Karen Armstrong, I have recommended her Battle for God in the past to students when talking about religious fundamentalism with the caveat that they should take her “the fundies are coming” hysterics with a grain of salt. At least she offers a more nuanced popular discussion of religion than the truly awful CNN miniseries God’s Warriors. Micklethwait and Wooldridge are much better than Armstrong so I’ll be sending students to them. 

What books on the present day status of religion would try to get into the hands of high school and freshmen college students?]]></description>

She is a former nun who rejected her past and currently thinks that all we need is ethics and liberal  theism. She aims for a popular audience and writes a book a year. This book by Micklethwait and Wooldrid is borderline popular-high culture like the Economist and takes more seriously various Orthodoxies.]]></description>
