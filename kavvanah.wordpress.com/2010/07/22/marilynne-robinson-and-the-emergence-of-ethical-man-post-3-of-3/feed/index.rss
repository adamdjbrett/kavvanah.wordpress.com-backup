					<description><![CDATA[This looks to be a good read along side Jaron Lanier&#039;s &quot;You Are Not a Gadget&quot; - a &quot;deep human&quot; response to the effects of philosophy deriving from technology (Singularity and &quot;transhumanism&quot;), than scientific reductionism, but we live in a world no less built by technologist engineers than &#039;sci&#039; scientists (and most &quot;mad scientists&quot; are really just mad engineers).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/marilynne-robinson-and-the-emergence-of-ethical-man-post-3-of-3/#comment-1366&quot;&gt;Lawrence Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;.

I did not include LMF on purpose. You are completely correct about LMF. No argument on my part. 
In UBM - it is a bit trickier. When describing Sinai  it fits into the dialectic model, when it does religious experience it is LMF, but when unpacking the ethical and the natural state of man, I hear resonances of Emergence of Ethical Man.  We get the language of selfish natural man and the need to raise ourselves. In ubm, we get a language of revelation and one of religious experience that are not co-extensive, not just as the shift from &quot;awareness of God&quot; to the halakhah. Maybe I should take UBM off my list. 
Thanks for the clarification.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan: What about the rational religious consciousness in U-Vishtem? Does not this precede revelation? Again, in LMF Adam the second  has a depth awareness of God  prior to revelation. See my chart at the end of  my article, Maimonides and Soloveitchik on the Knowledge and Imitation of God.&quot;  Am I missing something?]]></description>
