					<description><![CDATA[Very fascinating piece on this seemingly small group of Israeli religious or formerly religious expressing a clearly minority view for the Dati community.  What fascinates me is how they describe their personal relationships with Judaism with the political events that surrounded them in Israel.  Rabin&#039;s assassination seems to have been the event that caused a line to be drawn in the sand.  One would often assume a crisis of faith leading to backing away from active observance.  For them, it seems that the racism and social injustices play the primary role, and crises of faith are secondary or non-existent.  Then again, perhaps those are one and the same.  Faith without an ethical practices for this crowd is challenging and seemingly contradictory.  Interesting to see this article at a time when the Haredi community is trying to show itself to not be racist in order to garner sympathy for the events in Emmanuel.]]></description>
