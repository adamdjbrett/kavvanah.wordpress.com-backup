				<p>Several months ago,<a href="../../../04/01/critique-of-kugel-1/index.html"> I posted a critique of Kugel.</a></p>
<p>Well lo and behold Marilynne Robinson&#8217;s <strong>Absence of Mind</strong> has a similar critique in her book pp 24-29. I was not expecting to find it here. Robinson had the same sense that I did that Kugel’s book was equally non-humanistic.</p>
<p>Robinson’s version of the critique is that Kugel assigns “primitively” on the Bible, “this most seminal text”  Kugel states that all meaning in the book is eisegetical and that any lessons for our life would be greeted by the Biblical authors with incomprehension. The book is not even religion but etiology for political and social realities.</p>
<p>In contrast, Robinson declares that no one would be reading the Bible today if it did not have what to teach.</p>
<p>Kugel states that books from Mesopotamia like Gilgamesh written 3000 years ago has no messages-so too the Bible has no messages<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Robinson writes that: on the contrary, Gilgamesh is one of the great stories of human civilization and its quest for immortality is eternal. There was brilliance to Babylonia. “The low estimate of Babylonia becomes the basis for a lowered estimate of the Hebrew Bible – the modernist declension.” Gilgamesh is not part of a religious canon and does not have exegesis and is still a great contribution to civilization</p>
<p>Robinson says that China, India, and Greece all have ancient works that allow us glimpses into how humanity deals with theodicy, anthropology, and catastrophe. If the Upanishads, Gilgamesh, and Homer have what to teach then so does the Bible</p>
<p>In this case, Robinson claims that we can learn from the monotheistic changes to the story. We cant assume Gilgamesh was just patched into Genesis and no one noticed the plagiarism- It was reworked to teach a specific message.</p>
<p>She thinks that Kugel assumes ancients had no culture and he has a low estimate of their creativity.</p>
<p>Kugel backs himself into the same false dichotomy as the fundamentalists and the new atheists. For Kugel, if the Bible is not that of the Scribes and their midrashic traditions, where texts are read intertextually and contemporaneously, then it is not religion.</p>
<p>Robinson also points out the conceit of moderns to think they are first to notice the ancient near east background in the bIble and the use of Gilgamesh. Grotius used Biblical similarities to Gilgamesh to argue for truth of Bible because they provided external confirmation!! She says, of course Moses used the fables and religions of antiquity – so what?</p>
<p>She concludes that Kugel’s claim that anyone who disagrees with him is dishonest is a modernist goal of showing others wrong. His need or anyone&#8217;s need for debunking the past as an urgent crusade without concern for the wealth of pre-modern knowledge, she rejects simply as a conceit.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Friends recommended that I read Marilynne Robinson&#8217;s writings, especially her Pulitzer winning novels. She is touted as a master craftsmith of the written word, theological believer, and creating her own form of Neo-Calvinism. So I decided to pick up her recent response to the skeptics.</p>
<p><strong>Absence of Mind: The Dispelling of Inwardness from the Modern Myth of the Self, by Marilynne Robinson</strong>, <em>Yale 158 pages</em></p>
<p>The book is her answer to the new atheists in which she argues that we have humanism, subjective self, and human experience. She does not respond to their claims as much as say that there is more to the world. She claims that they are creating a lack of mind, a lack of self. And that they are only creating a &#8220;para-scientific literature&#8221;</p>
<p>She quotes Dennett’s definition of religion “as about social systems avow with a belief in a supernatural agent.” Dennett is not talking about private religion, religious experience, religion as meaning in life or creation of moral order. Maimonidean rationalism, Buberian dialogue, and new age renewal is not religion for Dennett.</p>
<p>Robinson shows that the problem of materialism, scientism, and behaviorism are not new problems. She claims that the Materialist position is separated from the wealth of human insight. The subjective human mind is what gives us knowledge of the human experience.</p>
<p>She opens her book with a description of how scientists feel a sense of discovery, accomplishment, and fulfillment when they solve a scientific problem. From a human point of view, science is not just facts in a text book.</p>
<p>She is an advocate of the writings of William James and his radical empiricism. And treats the new atheists as rejecting James. She reduces much of their materialism and the selfish gene to the nineteenth arguments of T. H. Huxley. (more on this in later post- post #3) And she uses Freud as her example of psychological reductionism.She finds ever new ways of showing that these new writings do not add anything to the debate of the last two centuries. (Except that a generation of science trained religious fundamentalists are discovering them for a first time. They trade the absolute claims of their material religious fundamentalism for a secular version.)</p>
<p>She thinks they are bypassing Donne, Bach, the Sufi poets and Socrates. She considers as essential to human life metaphysics, imagination, human experience, and in turn these are to be considered a revelation from God</p>
<p>Even in the social realm, she finds their obsession with Fundamentalists misleading. She asks: what of the religion of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, or her own cultured Calvinism?  She does accept  from the new atheists that some of the fundamnetalists were equally bad for the soul since they are just as materialist and not concerned with the self as the new atheists.  They are also obscurantist and anti-education. She suggests and I agree<strong>, &#8220;that some of the new atheism is a reaction to militant religious fundamentalism.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>She agrees with Harvard popularize of science Stephen Gould, that religion and science have nothing to do with each other. Gould used to be assigned at YU and the subject of frequent public lectures by the Bio dept.</p>
<p>Pinker considers that religion offers the answers to the ultimate questions, but since the ultimate questions are unanswerable then we dismiss the whole activity. To this  she answers, no, no, no. Questions that are deemed unanswerable has driven the thoughts of humanity. The history of civilization  answers these questions in ever new answers and forms. From the Library at Alexandria  to the Library of Congress we have collections that enrich our lives- ideas, texts, human experiences, quests for meaning.</p>
<p>She is defiantly preaching the choir. She assumes her reader has read, or at least can read, Grotius, Calvin, Spenser, Emerson, Jung, Searle and Putnam. Those who cannot are the very materialists swayed by the new rhetoric. And those who defend against the new atheists through materialist apologetics and trying to refute scientific method wont find comfort here either.  Religion is not in the scientific realm. Yet, Robinison as a committed non-liberal Calvinist does point in the direction that future discussions of a viable religion position needs to take.</p>
<blockquote><p>Quotes from reviews:</p>
<p>Robinson makes a strong, unapologetic case, not for mystery but for self-respect.</p>
<p>We look in the mirror, Marilynne Robinson writes in &#8220;Absence of Mind,&#8221; and we see an untrustworthy, self-interested creature with an untrustworthy mind. No wonder a philosopher such as Tolle, for instance, who offers the idea that we aren&#8217;t so bad after all, that we have a right to believe in the value of experience and the mystery of the universe, might be clung to like a floe that a polar bear has finally found to rest upon.</p>
<p>Winner of a Pulitzer Prize for her novel &#8220;Gilead,&#8221; Robinson in this new nonfiction work questions the authority of science, not its methods, which she sees as evidence for the capacity and beauty of the human mind. She is annoyed by the arrogance of modernist thought, which has entrapped us for so many generations: &#8220;After Darwin, after Nietzsche, after Freud, after structuralism and post-structuralism, after Crick and Watson and the death of God, some assumptions were to be regarded as fixed and inevitable and others as exposed for all time and for all purposes as naïve and untenable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robinson, however, affirms her own &#8220;very high estimate of human nature&#8221;: &#8220;We have had a place in the universe since it occurred to the first of our species to ask what our place might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>But positivism and modernist thought have had the opposite effect: They encourage the &#8220;exclusion of felt life&#8221;: We are discouraged from making explanations about our place in the universe. Subjectivity is not allowed; instead, there is what Robinson calls an &#8220;absence of mind.&#8221;</p>

				<p><strong>If I forget thee, Jerusalem,</strong><br />
Then let my right be forgotten.<br />
Let my right be forgotten, and my left remember.<br />
Let my left remember, and your right close<br />
And your mouth open near the gate.</p>
<p>I shall remember Jerusalem<br />
And forget the forest &#8212; my love will remember,<br />
Will open her hair, will close my window,<br />
will forget my right,<br />
Will forget my left.</p>
<p>If the west wind does not come<br />
I&#8217;ll never forgive the walls,<br />
Or the sea, or myself.<br />
Should my right forget<br />
My left shall forgive,<br />
I shall forget all water,<br />
I shall forget my mother.</p>
<p>If I forget thee, Jerusalem,<br />
Let my blood be forgotten.<br />
I shall touch your forehead,<br />
Forget my own,<br />

For the second and last time<br />
To the most terrible of voices &#8212;<br />
Or silence.</p>
<p><strong>Let the memorial hill remember</strong></p>
<p>Let the memorial hill remember instead of me,<br />

Let the beasts of the field and birds of the heavens eat and remember.<br />
Let all of them remember so that I can rest.</p>
<p><strong>A Touch of Grace:</strong></p>
<p>At times Jerusalem is a city of knives,<br />
And even the hopes for peace are sharp enough to slice into<br />
The harsh reality and they become dulled or broken.<br />
The church bells try so hard to ring out calm, round tones,<br />
But they become heavy like a pestle pounding on a mortar,<br />
Heavy, muffled, downtrodding voices. And the cantor<br />
And the muezzin try to sing sweetly<br />
But in the end the sharp wail bursts forth:<br />
O Lord, God of us all, The Lord is One<br />
One, one, one, one.<br />
(The Hebrew word for &#8220;one&#8221; also means &#8220;sharp&#8221; in Hebrew)</p>
<p><strong>Love of the Land</strong><br />
by Yehuda Amichai / Translated by Linda Zisquit</p>
<p>And the land is divided<br />
into districts of memory and regions of hope,<br />
and the residents mingle with each other,<br />
like people returning from a wedding<br />
with those returning from a funeral.</p>
<p>And the land isn&#8217;t divided into war zones and peace zones.<br />
And whoever digs a trench against cannon shells,<br />
will return and lie in it with his girl,<br />
if he lives till peace comes.</p>
<p>And the land is pretty.<br />
Even surrounding enemies decorate it<br />
with weapons shining in the sun<br />
like beads on a neck.</p>
<p>And the lands a package-land:<br />
and its well-tied and everything is in it,<br />
and its tightly bound<br />
and the strings sometimes hurt.</p>
<p>The land is very small<br />
and I can contain it inside me.<br />
The erosion of the land also erodes my rest<br />
and the level of the Kinneret is always on my mind.<br />
Therefore I am able to feel it entirely<br />
by shutting an eye: sea-valley-mountain.<br />
And therefore I am able to remember<br />
all that&#8217;s happened in it<br />
at once, like a person remembering<br />
his entire life at the moment of death.</p>
<p><strong>Poem #12 Eicha</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;How doth the city sit solitary,&#8221; the prophet<br />
lamented over Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If Jerusalem is a woman, does she know desire?<br />
When she cries out, is it from pleasure<br />
or pain? What is the secret of her appeal?<br />
When does she open her gates willingly and when is it rape?</p>
<p>All her lovers abandon her, leaving her<br />
with the wages of love necklaces earrings,<br />
towers and houses of prayer<br />
in the English, Italian, Russian, Greek, Arab styles,<br />
wood and stone, turrets and gables, wrought-iron gates,<br />
rings of gold and silver, riots of color. They all give her<br />
something to remember her by, then abandon her.</p>
<p>I would have liked to talk to her again, but I lost her<br />
among the dancers. Dance is total abandon.<br />
Jerusalem sees only the skies above her<br />
and whoever sees only the skies above&#8211;not<br />
the face of her lover&#8211;truly does lie solitary,<br />
sit solitary, stand solitary, and dance all alone.</p>
<p><strong>“Songs of Zion the Beautiful #21”</strong></p>
<p>Jerusalem’s a place where everyone remembers he’s forgotten something<br />
but doesn’t remember what it is.<br />
And for the sake of remembering I wear my father’s face over mine.<br />
This is the city where my dream-containers fill up like a diver’s oxygen tanks.<br />
Its holiness sometimes turns into love.<br />
And the questions that are asked in these hills<br />
are the same as they’ve always been: “Have you<br />
seen my sheep?” “Have you seen my shepherd?”<br />
And the door of my house stands open<br />
like a tomb where someone was resurrected.</p>

				<p>We had a nice debate going between Kevin and Arie on relativism. Here was the original discussion that got me interested. It was on the Legal blog <a href="http://www.mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/">Mirror of Justice</a> between July 2 and July 10. Here are some of the positions. There were thousands of words on the topic. These are some of the less semantic and less technical responces. I must note that Leslie Green himself tweeted the discussion here. I alternate blockquote and italics to differentiate. I did not write any of the material below.</p>
<blockquote><p>Green inadvertently affirms the future Pope&#8217;s thesis when he argues that we do have minimum moral standards and that they are determined by the ever changing  whims the majority.  To this country bumpkin, that sure sounds like relativism. But, what do I know? <strong>Michael S</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>The point that Pope Benedict is trying to communicate, I believe, is that many people, including many influential people, appeal (sometimes only implicitly, but sometimes quite explicitly) to relativism in the face of demanding moral claims. People want to do what they want to do. As the socially liberal movie maker Woody Allen famously said, &#8220;the heart wants what the heart wants.&#8221;  So, when morality gets in the way, many are tempted to say (sincerely enough, even if often inconsistently) that morality lacks any objective basis. <strong>Robert George</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p>The serious disagreement between Pope Benedict and Robby (and Catholic moral-theological traditionalists generally) on the one side, and some Catholic moral-theological dissidents on the other, with respect to the issue of same-sex sexual conduct, is a disagreement about the requirements of human well-being.  This is a disagreement between two groups neither of whom is relativist (or subjectivist), both of whom are fiercely anti-relativist. <strong>Michael Perry</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>When I was young, innocent, and hopeful, a conversation broke out among several friends and myself about the old &#8216;Nazis marching in Skokie&#8217; case, which I had read about in connection with a history of the ACLU.  Some of my friends, with whom I was inclined to agree, thought if fitting for the city to prohibit the march.  Other friends, with whom I was inclined to disagree, argued that the prohibition was a violation of the Nazis&#8217; First Amendment rights.   I recall feeling great irritation with this latter observation, and I said as much.  It just couldn&#8217;t be licit, I thought…For in &#8216;tolerating everything&#8217; one would be tolerating, among other things, intolerance &#8212; toleration&#8217;s contrary.    </p>
<p>I hit upon a tentative solution that I later recognized to have been a primitive grope in the direction of Kripke&#8217;s response to the  Epimenides (the &#8216;paradox of the liar&#8217;). The Epimenides, as many here will recall, is the paradox occasioned by a statement&#8217;s apparent self-denial &#8212; a statement of the form &#8216;this statement is false.&#8217;  The putative paradox stems from the statement&#8217;s being false if it is true, and true if it is false &#8212; assuming, of course, that it must be one or the other and not both.  (That assumption turns out to be false.)<br />
Now intuitively, Kripke&#8217;s response to paradoxes of this form, if I&#8217;m remembering it rightly, involves distinguishing between what he calls &#8216;grounded&#8217; and &#8216;ungrounded&#8217; statements.  A grounded statement, again if I recall this correctly, is about something other than a statement.  It&#8217;s about dogs, or cats, or what ever, anything other than statements.  So long as you have one of those, then any statement about that statement, or about a statement about the statement about the (grounded) statement, or &#8230; , will itself be grounded as well.  Otherwise, not.  If one then stipulates that only a grounded statement is possessed of a truth value, one defuses the Epimenides by observing that the self-denying proposition in question is ungrounded, hence possessed of no truth value at all, true or false, hence not paradoxical in the &#8216;both true and false&#8217; sense.</p>
<p>Now my own youthful proto-Kripkean response to the &#8216;tolerance&#8217; conundrum worked in much the same way as Kripke&#8217;s response to the Epimenides: &#8216;Tolerance,&#8217; I speculated, always carried what I then called a sort of &#8216;argument place&#8217; with it.  It always implicates what the grammarians call a &#8216;direct object.&#8217;  One does not simply &#8216;tolerate.&#8217;  One &#8216;tolerates x,&#8217; or &#8216;tolerates y,&#8217; etc.  Further, assuming some x that it is right to tolerate and wrong not to tolerate, it surely will often be right not to tolerate intolerance of that x.  At any rate it will need not be incoherent to deny toleration to such instances of intolerance.  </p>
<p>Now, how does this bear on the conversation here?  I think in this way:   There seems to be much intolerance afoot in some quarters, for example, of girls and women who wish to participate on equal terms with boys and men in educational and vocational settings.  My guess is that most of us in &#8216;the West,&#8217; be we generally &#8216;leftward&#8217;- or &#8216;rightward&#8217;-leaning where political questions are concerned, agree that instances of this form of intolerance are not to be tolerated, either as an ethical or as a legal matter.  And there is no incoherence, nor need there be any bigotry or relativism, in any such judgment.  </p>
<p>All of us, &#8216;left&#8217; or &#8216;right&#8217; or &#8216;in between,&#8217; who find sexism of the specified type intolerable are simply taking a universally applicable human right seriously &#8212; &#8216;absolutely&#8217; seriously.  We are not thinking as &#8216;bigots&#8217; or &#8216;relativists.&#8217;  And we might even be right, moreover, in some cases, to describe certain instances of the particular form of intolerance itself as bigoted or relativist &#8212; if prompted or defended, say, by reference to a putatively relevant &#8216;fundamental difference&#8217; between women and men, or to a putative &#8216;religious&#8217; or &#8216;cultural&#8217; right to subordinate women.   </p>
<p>There are some, for example, who appear to take sexual orientation to be more a matter of behavior or &#8216;lifestyle choice&#8217; than of genetically determined or deeply-psychologically-rooted identity.  There are others who appear to see things the other way round.  </p>
<p>To those who see sexual orientation as merely a &#8216;lifestyle choice,&#8217; by contrast, it will sometimes be tempting, again in careless moments, to view defenders of &#8216;gay rights&#8217; or &#8216;gay marriage&#8217; as &#8216;relativists.&#8217;  For it will sometimes seem to them, again prior to reflection, that their opponents think &#8216;anything goes&#8217; where behavior and &#8216;lifestyle choice&#8217; are concerned.  But in fact bigotry and relativism are apt to be neither here nor there in these cases.  For in fact most on both sides will be absolutists about moral and ethical matters, and in agreement that it is ethically wrongful to view persons as subordinate on the basis of ineluctable attributes.</p>
<p>And it is only by keeping one&#8217;s eye on the real ball &#8212; that is, by fixing attention on the act or attribute in question &#8212; that we keep the door open to real progress.  I fear that labeling, as &#8216;bigots&#8217; or &#8216;relativists,&#8217; those who view the ball differently than we do is, all too often, an indicator that our eyes have strayed from the ball, and that the discussion has accordingly become ungrounded.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Last month on the BBC there was an all-star discussion of Cardinal Ratzinger’s phrase “Dictatorship of Relativism.” Discussants included the philosophers Simon Blackburn and Stephen Wang, Archbishop Williams, and members of Parliament. Williams was even keel and noted how fundamentalism and relativism are flip sides of each other – both are absolute and close down discussion. Williams also noted how easily people move from fundamentalism to non-belief. </p>
<p>However, Leslie Green Professor of Philosophy of Law, Balliol College, Cambridge launched into a biting critique seeing that those who throw around the word skepticism are scapegoating ones anxieties. The Nazis blamed the Jews, the Pope blamed the relativists. This is important because many Rabbis use buzz words like relativist, following zeitgeist, or post-modern in the same way to designate whatever they don’t like. Green also denies that people are relativist or that they think anything goes. Finally, he asks how much should we tolerate the demands of religious groups that go against public welfare? He offers a note that religious groups are good at arguing from pseudo-sociological data.</p>
<p>On the blogs that I read this interview has been generating much discussion. I will give some of the conflicting reactions in a later post- along with more of my comments. But in the meantime, if you got a chance to enter the discussion- What would you say after Leslie Green?</p>
<p><em>In April 2005 Joseph Ratzinger, the most powerful<br />
theologian in the Roman Catholic Church, delivered a homily to the cardinals preparing for the conclave that was to elect him Pope.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>
RATZINGER (Source: Vatican Radio): Today, having a clear faith based on the Creed of the Church is often labelled as fundamentalism. Whereas relativism, that is, letting oneself be &#8220;tossed here and there, carried about by every wind of doctrine&#8221;, seems the only attitude that can cope with modern times. We are<br />
building a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one&#8217;s own ego and desires.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>WILLIAMS: To the extent I think that people are a bit threatened and a bit impatient about real engagement and argument, then the odd thing is that fundamentalism is the mirror image of a kind of<br />
inflexible relativism. People want the arguments to be over. Just as the relativist or the junior official in the Foreign Office &#8211; we want the arguments to be over, let’s just you know treat everyone equally<br />
&#8211; so the fundamentalist says I want the arguments to be over. And what one philosopher who matters quite a lot to me said about thelabour and the patience and the pain of real thinking just disappears.</p>
<p>GREEN: In the 1930s, in Germany, anything that was bad in the eyes of the German state &#8211; 32, 39 &#8211; was caused by who? The Jews. Why? They didn’t like the Jews. America &#8211; 1952, 55. Anything that<br />
was bad in America was caused by well who? The Communists. Well why? Because they didn’t like the Communists. And so now here we are &#8211; 2005. Benedict I of course invents this concept of the dictatorship of relativism. There’s a bunch/clutch of bad things<br />
happening and he doesn’t like them. Who’s it caused by? Caused by the relativists, you know. </p>
<p>GREEN: No-one in this country or in America or in Europe thinks that anything goes. So let’s take sexual morality. Sadly, to my way of thinking, since there’s so much that’s rich and important in Catholic moral theology, the Church has transformed itself into a<br />
kind of fertility cult, so that what it really cares about now is making sure that you know men aren’t having sex with men and nobody’s having abortions and there are no condoms in the JCR around the corner here and that there aren’t any divorces. Well even in a fairly liberal, tolerant sexual morality, there’s nobody<br />
that argues that anything goes. The people that Pope Benedict deplores don’t think that rape is okay, and they certainly don’tthink that the sexual abuse of children is okay. Everybody agrees<br />
there is a bottom line minimum to which we all must conform. And the thing is of course that some folks disagree about where theminimums should be drawn. That’s democracy.</p>
<p>GREEN: So that if I  can say well I’m a member of a church and the view in my church happens to be that all children have to participate in animal<br />
sacrifice and so we’re not allowing children to be adopted out to families that don’t tolerate the sacrifice of rams on the full moon every month &#8211; we would say “No, this is preposterous” even although it’s only a sheep. Now people can disagree about this, and  obviously many religious people disagree because they have very firm &#8211; dare I say &#8211; absolutist, fundamentalist and mostly uninformed views about the nature of human sexuality that are overlain on top of their religious views. They’re entitled to those.<br />
But if you’re providing a service to the public &#8211; you’re not talking about your little congregation, you’re<br />
talking about the fates of children, their welfare and their wellbeing &#8211; you have an obligation to respect the minimum.</em></p>

				<p>For an earlier posting on Rav Morgenstern’s teaching of <a href="http:///kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/rabbi-morgenstern-and-meditation/">meditation –see here</a></p>
<p>The Komarno Rebbe has yet to merit a scholarly treatment or even a Wikipedia entry.<br />
In the meantime you can read about his uncle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzvi_Hirsh_of_Zidichov">Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov</a> or a general overview at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komarno_%28Chassidic_Dynasty%29">Komarno article.</a> You can also read<br />
<strong>Turn Aside from Evil and Do Good: An Introduction and a Way to the Tree of Life</strong>, by Zevi Hirsch Eichenstein, translation and introduction by Louis Jacobs,</p>
<p>I remember when Moshe Idel offered Komarno as an undergraduate seminar, there were only four of us in the room- two undergraduates, myself, and another YU grad. Idel spend most of his time showing how the autobiography-diary can be used to unpack discussions about experience. In the diary, he writes “I did” and in his theoretical writings he writes “One should” or “It was done by some.” Idel also pointed out that the three most erudite Kabbalists among Hasidic rebbes were the Komarno, Hayim of Chernowitz, and the Koznitzer.</p>
<p>The Komaro wrote dozens of works and at least ten of them major works, a commentary on the Zohar –Zohar Hai, a commentary on Humash- Heikhal Ha-Berachah, a mystical diary, commentaries on Mizvot, on mishneh, and much more. The Komarno Rebbe practiced the Lurianic-Vital Yihudim, actively sought the presence of the shekhinah, and had conversations with deceased saints. His introduction to Humash mentions how Moshe received an out of body ex-static experience. His was a Hasidism of doing, a religious life of performing yihudim, tikuniim, and segulot. He and his uncle had a special disdain for Chabad because they turned chasidus into a form of hakirah- philosophic investigation.</p>
<p>When I received two shiurim from Rav Morgenstern on Komarno I was pleased and looked forward to studying them. They are based on his shiur in Yiddish 8 pm on Tuesday nights – ohalei yosef #4. On other nights he gives shiur on Breslov, Ashlag, and Chabad. The shiurim are ostensively on  Netiv Mitzvotekha by the Komarno rebbe. From the nature of shiur one gets a sense that it is to relative beginners who want a smattering of all things in Kabbalah. He reads a passage in Komarno and then proceeds to tell his listener what it means in the Ramak, Ramchal, Baal ha-Tanya, Rav Nahman, and Ashlag.  Mostly, it is Chabad material- he turns Komarno sodot into theoretical discussions of the higher and lower unity, tzimzum, egul ve yosher. It is the very approach that Komarno warns against.</p>
<p>He does discuss how according to Komarno mitzvoth have deep secrets leading to devekus, but he connects it to theoretical discussions from Chabad rather than the hands -on Kabbalistic approach that uses Chayyim Vital’s Shaar Ha-Mizvot and Shaar Hakavvanot<br />
Yihudah tataah  is defined as sensing that nothing is random – all things that occur are part of Hashem’s plan. We need to feel God’s omnipresence in our lives and that everything is providence.<br />
Rav Morgenstern repeatedly quotes Ramchal and Nefesh Hahayyim- that all of this is mashal and it is all from our human perspective. This is quite non-Komarno.</p>
<p>Shiur Two is on sweetening of judgment (hamtakat hadinim)  Rav Morgenstern emphasizes our sins and less the cosmic judgments from the shvirah.<br />
In this shiur he defines the path of the Besht as devekut, emunah, and yichud. The first is the secrets of the commandments, the second is see that all is providence, and the third is meditation. This is not the way most groups define the Besht. Compare any introduction to the Besht to see the difference.<br />
The major new point here is the emphasis on working on Emunah – this places Rav Morgenstern in a set with Rav Moshe Wolfson, and Rabbi Itamar Schwartz –there are require emunah more than knowledge of kabbalah or religious experience .  Not a quietist negation of the self and only think about God as usually taught in Hasidut rather a goal to believe that all is God and His providence.</p>
<p>I recommend as a baseline for understanding the recent material Benjamin Brown &#8211; Initial Faith and Final Faith &#8211; Three 20th Century Haredi Thinkers&#8217; Concepts of Faith [1998] (Hebrew) <em>Akdamot</em> 4 where he deals with the Hazon Ish, the Rebbe Riyatz, Miktav MiEliyahu, Chofets Chaim and others.  </p>
<p>Rav Morgenstern explains the Shema as teaching that God is an eyn sof; that is exactly the sort of Chabad approach avoided in the original call to follow the Arizal.<br />
Rav Morgenstern explains yihudim as Letters of the divine name serving as a symbol or parable for Hashem. He then adds his own interest, “So too light…most ephemeral thing.” On p 15 we get one of his give aways that he has read a meditation manual when he writes that one needs to reign in one thoughts and stop them from flitting from one subject to another – one needs to learn to focus.</p>
<p>The Komarno states that he explained a topic fully in Notzer Hessed, but Rav Morgenstern’s shiur does not give the parallel material.<br />
Rav Morgenstern’s message is that Those who learn deep secrets of the torah are confronted with trials and tribulations. We should see all suffering as divine providence  (It is interesting that he is willing to return to this in a post holocaust world.)</p>
<p>The end of the second shiur has a full page based on Ashlag’s shamati. He quotes Ramchal Tikkunim Hadashim on the concept of providential mishpat – but does not discuss the counter balance of melukhah.<br />
He concludes that our main worship is to reveal Divinity as taught by Tanya.<br />
If one wants a shiur closer to the text of Komarno, I have been told that several of the einiklach give shiur including R. Netanel Safrin in J-M.</p>
