					<description><![CDATA[Blessings to all you wonderful holy people! What a joy to see others also drawing from the wellsprings of our holy tzaddikim! May each merit to rectify our individual soull-roots - as well as that of the collective! Perhaps the Torah of Komarno has only made its initial impression, but I suspect that a time is coming when his light will be so very relevent to the world. I pray that more will access his awesome teachings! Some nice translations are found by Baruch Emanuel Erdstein on Kabbalahline.org.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/rav-morgenstern-on-komarno/#comment-1308&quot;&gt;Rabbi Yaakov Feldman&lt;/a&gt;.

I did not find he misread the material. He just taught what he wanted, especially Chabad, and was not seeking an explanation of Komarno. I would just not use it as an introduction to Komarno. 
My major point was the role of emunah in his thought - he is a rebbe and life-coach of emunah. Second, that he did not use Komarno for religious experience but pointed his reader to his writings on light meditations or to Chabad hitbonnenut.  

Here is a translated piece of real Komarno on the web- notice how different it is.

					<description><![CDATA[Your point is certainly well taken, Dr. Brill. You understand of course, though, that R&#039; Morgenstern has a couple of &quot;agendas&quot; for lack of a better term -- teaching goals. First, to introduce his students to a plethora of spiritual material that wouldn&#039;t otherwise be exposed to. And second, to have them experience the presence of God. 
He&#039;s not an academic, though he&#039;s certainly &quot;scholarly&quot;, i.e., learned. But at bottom he&#039;s a rebbe, a guide and life-coach. While technically correct, accusing him of mis-reading the material is as unfair as accusing the earlier Chassidim of mis-reading Talmud, Midrash, Halacha, etc. Like R&#039; Morgenstern, they were using accepted material as bouncing-off points for their own insights which they needed to justify by citing earlier, dependable sources. 
I personally found his treatment of this material delicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not have much knowledge of hasidut komarno, but I have studied quite a bit of hasidut habad.  I dont know that the difference between the two is a matter of theory vs. praxis.  kuntres hitpaalut (luis jacobs translated it) and shaar hayihud (a recent translation is available online) are essentially instruction manuals on hitbonenut.  perhaps the difference is that hasidut habad conceives of hitbonenut as a reflection (in shaar hayihud this is a robust description of the whole concatenation of worlds) on a thematic subject.... whereas perhaps in komarno it was the use of the specific lurianic yihudim, which are non-thematic?  but in any event, habad texts definitely emphasize praxis, so I think the difference is not in thinking v.s. doing but in what &quot;doing&quot; consists of.]]></description>
