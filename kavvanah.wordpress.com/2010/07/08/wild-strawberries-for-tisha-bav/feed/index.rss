					<description><![CDATA[When I first read this post, I was  disturbed. 

At first it was because I am personally highly traditional and would prefer going through the motions of mourning than making Tisha B;Av into something that it is not.

But upon reflection, i realized that i am fine with watching Holocaust movies on Tisha B&#039;Av afternoon (as several girls from my class in High School did) and i could evening  sympathize if someone or an organization wants to focus on Darfur, Rwanda or Cambodia.

However, I find watching Wild Strawberries (from your description) narcissistic. An unhealthy focusing on one&#039;s personal issues &#038; wrong choices rather than on the suffering of either the Jewish community&#039;s or society&#039;s sufferings.]]></description>
