					<description><![CDATA[Obviously, not having read much of his work this is speculative, but it strikes me that there is something bizarre going on when the academic study of the history of kabballah is attacked as bearing an inauthentic narrative that ramifies itself in all sorts of amazingly far-reaching ways.

I would also question the supposed greater commitment to &quot;humanism&quot; (and I believe that Shasha could rightly be accused of equivocating on the meaning of the term in his essay)   of a tradition that while perhaps rationalist,  was committed to esotericism.]]></description>

The question remains if Idel is right about Maimonides- just because Idel writes it does not make it true. More importantly, Idel may still be mythological and magical even if he writes an article on Maimonides. 
Idel in one of his article distinguishes Maimonidean philosophy from literary uses or pseudo-scholastic readings. Idel himself acknowledges that Abulafia&#039;s understanding of Maimonides to accommodate Ashkenaz theosophy is far from the readings of Radak, Falquera, ibn Tibbons, or Efodi. And culturally, these figures had a rationalism based on Saadyah, Ibn Ezra, and Maimonides. In contrast, de Leon and Abulafia are not living with a rational theology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sasha posits a dichotomy between the &#039;rational&#039; Maimonides and the &#039;mythological&#039; Idel. In his article on Maimonides and the Kabbalah, Idel shows just how Maimonides&#039; prophetic platonic psychology expounded in the &#039;Guide&#039; is absolutely critical for the great upsurge of Kabbalah immediately afterwards (both Abulafia and Moses de Leon began their careers with an intensive study of the &#039;Guide&#039;). While Maimonides deliberately avoids mentioning &#039;Sefer Yetsira&#039;, a careful reading of the Guide might indicate to a few the mystical inclinations of the Great Eagle, albeit &#039;purified&#039; by the discipline of Philosophy.]]></description>

Drew,
Short answer - read the book - it is a good book. 
Longer answer- the are a lot of great ideas in the book but he does not engage the historic Maimonides who used mystical or meta-psychic elements from Ibn Sina, Ibn Bajjah, Ismaelis, and Sufis. Nor does Faur enter into dialogue with contemporary theories of mysticism. The book is both engaging and beautiful, yet at the same time it is hermetically sealed. It is good for opening up potential understandings overlooked by others.]]></description>

Avi,
I have asked you before- reciting the name of an article is not a discussion.
What does the article say? How is it more complicated than Shasha&#039;s presentation? 
Is Idel correct in the article?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find this a fascinating post based on my own involvement in Sephardic studies. Just a few comments: 
1) Jose Faur, coming from the Halabi-Sephardic tradition, sees Maimonides as a mystic with his own alternative to kabbala. Yet the citations from Shasha don&#039;t deal with this possibility and seem to present this as a debate between rationalism and mysticism, rather than as a debate between two alternative systems of mysticism. It would be more worthwhile to explain how the Moreh can function as a source for an alternative mysticism in this age, and why he feels there is no possibility of a rational kabbala.
2) Shasha feels that kabbala undermines Sephardic humanism, but the question is to what degree his ideas of Sephardic humanism are informed by contemporary, post-modern academic ideas. Faur locates the destruction of Spanish Jewry to the activities of Ashkenazi anti-Maimonidean kabbalists, but does the almost ubiquitous presence of kabbalah in Eastern Jewish halakhic culture before R. Ovadiah (and still in popular Mizrahi culture) mean that the tradition of Sephardic humanism does not exist except among the Spanish-Portuguese?! Or are all of the kabbalistic Sephardic traditions of the past 500 years out? Are there no universalistic, authentically Sephardic spokesmen of kabbala?
3) His critique of nationalism/Zionism is interesting because Jose Faur is very critical of &quot;oedipal Jews&quot; (his words) who were and are opposed to the establishment of the State and the national elements of the tradition of Israel. Shasha&#039;s critique is the standard post-modern trope that purposely disregards the many universalistic voices in Zionism as well as the rigid nationalist claims being made by Muslim/Arab activists who are opposed to compromise. Are national claims inherently problematic? Why can&#039;t a case be made for the moral necessity of nationalism as a means of achieving the just claims of different peoples?]]></description>
