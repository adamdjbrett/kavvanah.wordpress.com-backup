					<description><![CDATA[I would argue that we are always on a path to eventually consume the &quot;crazy juice,&quot; making us &quot;the sane.&quot;  Often this is the case when the reality sets in that the exotic is not nearly as safe and welcoming as we anticipated.  To focus on the question of 1970s Jewry, those who become frum to find spiritual awakening often become jaded when it is realized that the frum community in which they entered is not as interested in awakening as they are in rote action.  For some, this leads to an eventual diminution of &quot;frumkeit&quot; because it wasn&#039;t what was expected.  For others, they find a niche that the mainstream of the community might feel is weird or strange, but they nevertheless accept, sometimes resulting from jealousy of not having the same emotional connection as the newbie has.  The newbie eventually has to drink the water when it comes to the next generation, for the kids don&#039;t have the same emotional connection the parent does because of the issue of choice.  

A second element would be that much of spirituality, having become synonymous with  pop-psychology, considers awakening as something that is not right in one&#039;s psyche as opposed to a goal.  This seems to be similar to how the Mussar movement used medieval and early modern ethical works, such as Mesilat Yesharim.  It was no longer about reaching ruach haqodesh but rather it became about defeating our Yetzer Hara by studying the first three parts of the path.   The rest of the path is still a focus of Kabbalists. 

I think that these stories exemplify that the &quot;craziness&quot; gets watered down when faced with being outside the box.  Yet, the Rebbe Nachman story leaves a glimmer of hope that we can conform and still pursue some form of spiritual awakening.  We can read spiritual texts and work towards the higher goals.  Perhaps the challenge then becomes doing it in such a way that we aren&#039;t outwardly showing &quot;craziness&quot; while we have a sign to remind us we are differentiating ourselves from others.  

Additionally, I find that Eiver LeNahar&#039;s piece seems to relate well to the piece by Jonathan Schorsch that you posted recently about how each generation always smashes the idols of the previous generation.  New conformities arise and new ways of participating in life arise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The stories remind me of the 60&#039;s guru and dreikop R.D. Laing. 

Perhaps someone can bring me up to snuff as to what &quot;non-dual  states of perception&quot; refers. I understand the idea that consciousness, though a causal link in the chain that leads to actions, is an epiphenomenom.  The real macher  in each of us are our neural brain states. Our brains decide and let us know. My sense of what is being said here is that we see the world but miss interesting details, which is true but not so exciting.]]></description>
