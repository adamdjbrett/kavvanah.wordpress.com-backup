					<description><![CDATA[I thought about this question over the weekend and now believe that it is inappropriate to use a Jewish or Christian historical paradigm to understand the Gulen movement, in America or in Turkey. Conservative in the 1910&#039;s &#038; Modern Orthodox Judaism in the 1950&#039;s are not like a Muslim movement in 2010. There are too many factors, both external &#038; interal, involved to make any serious judgements.

However, upon reflection, i thought that perhaps one could apply Christian Smith&#039;s Sub-culture Identity Theory (Quoted Below):

Propositions:
1)	The human being drives for meaning and belonging are satisfied primarily by locating human selves within social groups that sustain distinctive, morally orienting collective identities.
2)	Social groups construct and maintain collective identities by drawing symbols between themselves and relevant outgroups.
3)	Religious traditions have always strategically renegotiated their collective identities by continually reformulating the ways their constructed orthodoxies engage the changing sociological environments they confront.
4)	Because the socially normative bases of identity-legitimation are historically variable, modern religious believers can establish stronger religious identities and commitments on the basis of individual choice than through ascription.
5)	Individuals and groups define their values and norms and evaluate their identities and actions in relations to specific, chosen reference groups; dissimilar and antagonistic outgroups may serve as negative reference groups.
6)	Modern pluralism promotes the formation of strong subcultures and potentially “deviant” identities, including religious subcultures and identities.
7)	Intergroup conflict in a pluralistic context typically strengthens in-group identity, solidarity, resources, and membership retension.
8)	Modernity can actually increase religion’s appeal, by creating social conditions which intensify the kinds of felt needs  and desires that religion is especially well-positioned to satisfy.

In addition to Smith’s “Subculture Identity Theory”, he has also formulated a related “subcultural identity theory of religious persistence” and “subcultural identity theory of religious strength”.

The subcultural identity theory of religious persistence:
Religion survives and can thrive in pluralistic, modern society by embedding itself in subcultures that offer morally orienting collective identities which provide adherents meaning and belonging.

And the subcultural identity theory of religious strength is this:
In a pluralistic society, those religious groups will be relatively stronger which better possess and employ the cultural tools needed to create both clear distinction from and significant engagement and tensions with other relevant outgroups, short of becoming genuinely countercultural.

So on the one hand, the fact that Gulen movement encourages its members to perform culturally distinctive acts &#038; markers does increase their distinctive identity. 

My question then is who are their measuring themselves against? 

Not other Muslims. Nor Americans or American society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;edited by site-owner&lt;/em&gt;

Gulen&#039;s school in Maryland closed. It was so bad when Chesapeake closed. The director (a sexist Turkish man) was excorted out the door by the police.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/29/AR2006032900704.html

this principal was moved to Gulen&#039;s TV station ERBU TV.  Remember Gulen owns Zaman, Fountain and  bunch other media to CONTROL propaganda about him and his movement.
