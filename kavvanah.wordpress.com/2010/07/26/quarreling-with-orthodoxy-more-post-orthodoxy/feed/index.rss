					<description><![CDATA[• The New Provincialism: orthodoxy is, by its very definition provincialism.  It was a response against the enlightenment that entailed a certain historical amnesia from the start.  I dont think you can really have an orthodoxy that is not provincial. 

• The Triumph of Sentimentality: 
Again, based on the definition given above, is an orthodoxy possible that does not deny the fundamental truthfulness of the world qua world, where the Torah is not the final arbiter of truth?  I think it would be possible to reframe what we mean by &quot;final arbiter of truth&quot;, but in the common sense of it, this is a statement that holds truth for historical and scientific material as well as ethical and doctrinal.  To step away from this would be to exceed orthodoxy.

• The Christian-Industrial Complex: I actually think that there are a lot of young people with innovative ideas regarding Jewish industry.  If grants were provided for innovative entrepeneurship I think a lot o f positive change could be obtained.  Eg. there is a guy who just graduated from NYU who has started an organic, naturally fed, free-range chicken shechita business.  This type of work can, I think, do a lot to subtly change the value systems of the community.

• Body-Count Evangelism-

a problem in outreach programs but, I think, not in standard shuls.  even in habad, however, I have been hearing a greater recognition that number are not what counts in the end because when the focus is on numbers quality goes down and there is more attrition in the long run.  there has, in my experience, been a greater focus on smaller and more intimate events recently.

• The Great Stereopticon - I agree that ends dont justify means.  however, i am not so sure the new mediums for teaching and outreach are problematic.  I see them as pedagogic tools.  They are not being used to alter actual ritual experiences.  I read an article a while ago that suggested that habad&#039;s use of videos of the Rebbe contributes to the sense of his post-mortem life.  I think this is only partially accurate.  the videos  are used to give people a sense of what it was like to be near the rebbe, the way he was in addition to his text-based teachings.  However, I think the more wacky beliefs stem from the rebbe&#039;s own theology re: the previous rebbe, they were fanned over the course of a generation and the videos have little to do with it.

in essence, i see items 1 and 2 as being the most relevant to contemporary orthodoxy and I think the solution lies outside of orthodoxy (though not in other denominations either)... almost something of a return to the past that never was, a variation of a Mendelsonnian &quot;orthodoxy&quot; (i.e. - as in his &quot;jerusalem&quot;, law over doctrine) that never got off the ground...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not see how it will overcome the provincialism, sentimentality, or materialism. Individuality and the Jewish catalog were the peak of sentimentality.

======  c&#039;mon, c&#039;mon .......   for most of the above, see Chapter 1.  Individuality is the antithesis of conformity, which is currently the overriding value of the O community.  The Jewish Catalog may have been the peak of sentimentality, but I believe it sold several hundred thousand copies, and was very helpful to many people.  (We need a J/Cat level guide to sane kashrut, for example).    And yes, the gender issue is undoubtedly the &#039;issue of the week&#039;, but I thought you would want something a little more long-term........

And the &#039;Rabbinic training&#039; that I had in mind was way past 1978.  But you only asked for Chapter headings!  BTW -- I am trying to remember - was 1978 such a bad year?????]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/quarreling-with-orthodoxy-more-post-orthodoxy/#comment-1405&quot;&gt;Paul Shaviv&lt;/a&gt;.

Paul,
Most of your suggestions sound like 1978.  I do not see how it will overcome the provincialism, sentimentality, or materialism. Individuality and the Jewish catalog were the peak of sentimentality.
Yours is a little too old time MO nostalgia. Centrism is real, it happened, people are halakhic but now want to solve certain problems. Ethics, lifestyle outside the enclave, reduce the cognitive dissidence with the outside world, and meaning. We want an approach that will curb the rampant skepticism and irony.

 Is your vision for rabbinic training much different than the articles by Eliezer Berkovits or Steven Riskin on creating a new rabbi?

And people dont mind humrot if they find meaning in them. Students of the Rav dont feel burdened by following Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s minhag  becuase it gives them identity.or people gladly follow the humrot of their yeshiva in Israel or of the Carlebach minyan. People dont like forced humrot when several different approaches occupy the same neighborhood.  Or when organizations give into pressure or vacillate between years.

People are bothered by the kiruv by means and the abuse of Rabbinic power. And the topic of the week for those younger liberals out there is certainly GLBT tolerance.

Can we get a modified list?]]></description>
