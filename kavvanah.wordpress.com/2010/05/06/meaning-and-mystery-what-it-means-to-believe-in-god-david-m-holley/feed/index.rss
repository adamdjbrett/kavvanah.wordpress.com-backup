					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/05/06/meaning-and-mystery-what-it-means-to-believe-in-god-david-m-holley/#comment-973&quot;&gt;ej&lt;/a&gt;.

I think that you are correct that there is a difference about reference to God in Orthodox circles. But people do say Barukh Hashem, or learn to say tehillim, or Hashem is testing me or I need to follow Hashem though mizvot. I would be nice if we had a study of the language used. There is a great sociology book &quot;The Book of Jerry Falwell&quot; that shows how that group learns to weave God into their daily language.In the current Orthodox configuration, the role of TMS or the ol mitzvvot may function as the marked of a God narrative.
To your other point, people who live their life to travel and have been to 70 countries and dont bother with home and hearth would not be able to have a meaning discussion of values with someone whose values are kin and kith. They can communicate (and debate) but neither side has enough commonality in their sense of meaning in life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the non foundational part which seems pretty clear. I am less clear on the role of God in Jewish narratives. There are tight controls who is a ben bayis, an intimate friend with God. And there are even tighter controls on what we allow God to say to us. A Rebbe who said &quot;I just had a chat with Hashem and He is definitely in favor of adding a new wing to our shtibel,&quot; is a goner. Even in immanentist accounts of ain od milevado, God doesn&#039;t end up as a character in a life story. I speculate than on closer analysis the relationship these days is with empirical objects, teachers, families, books, schools, neighborhoods. Evangelicals are schmoozers, they hold on tight to Jesus. We hold on tight to the books. 

I also don’t quite understand why people with religious narratives can’t communicate with outsiders. Can mountain climbers and adventurers communicate with the rest of us?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rav Shagar in Kelim Shuvim is openly post-modern, there is no certainty, no narratives, no harmony, no place to return to so we need to be post-modern Religious Zionist. And in the last two pages of the first essay, he affirms a God in the heart of our own creation not far from Green&#039;s position. There are some good reviews and debate in Hazofeh when it came out.

Holley is closer to your Kuzari idea.  Holley argues that God is from our personal narratives of meaning. Holly can explain the attraction of Orthodox Judaism or evangelicals, or renewal as a narrative of meaning. 
Rav Shagar rejects the concept of meta-narrative in Kelim Shevurim and Rav Shagar would certainly not justify all the -BT foundationalism or orthodox dogmatism]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I recall correctly,  R. Shaga&quot;r z&quot;l makes some similar points in &#039;Kelim Shevurim&#039;. 
I jotted down some musings on this issue a few years ago as I prepared for the Pesach seder:
http://adderabbi.blogspot.com/2006/04/identity-and-narrative.html

This discussion adds a dimension to the Kuzari&#039;s point about God introducing Himself as our Redeemer and not as the Creator. 
Ultimately, it can be a fundamental (and welcome) reorientation of the way we think of lots of things (including Chezkas Habatim).]]></description>
