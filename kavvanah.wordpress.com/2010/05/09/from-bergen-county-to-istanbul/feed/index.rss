					<description><![CDATA[I do not think the creationism, anti-secularism and general fundamentalism of Harun Yahya should get a pass just because he is Muslim. Nor does he get a pass because he is willing to meet with similarly inclined Jewish folks. The truth is that we need not cheer on fundamentalist alliances in any form. I understand the nuance of the situation; that dissent in Turkey is often couched in religious terms. I also understand that this political dissent might attract us to figures like Harun Yahya as exemplifying the power of religion to stand up to corrupt and militaristic regimes. Fine. But in thinking of religion as critique, we need to think about the endgame. Such an endgame, viz. a Harun Yahya state, would be fascistic, bellicose, and profoundly totalitarian. I think the analogous case of Khomeini; someone who I see as having a genuine Islamic critique, and even a nice theory of government, speaks to what we can expect from Fundamentalist rule. I would urge people to dissociate themselves from Yahya and his Judeo acolytes.]]></description>
