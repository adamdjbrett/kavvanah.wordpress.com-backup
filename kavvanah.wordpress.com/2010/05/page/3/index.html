				<p>Over Shabbat, I met another of the many Boro Park Hasidim who have left the Hasidic world. Our Bachur said that unlike his friends who went un-observant, he was looking for some form of modern Orthodox identity. </p>
<p>He mentioned that the Besht was his role model because the Besht did not care what people wore or what the people did. I have noticed this intense and gravely serious use of the Besht by others in the same situation. Many of the articles and dissertations on the LES Chulent mention the important use of the Besht as a justification. </p>
<p>I did not have a heart to tell them that we have no indication that the Besht did not care about these things. The image of Besht as friend of the common man was created by Shimon Dubnow based on Renan’s Life of Jesus. The common folk needed a voice to be harnessed by Dubnow’s Yiddishist Folks party. IL Peretz also used this image with a healthy dose of Tolstoy mixed in. From Dubnow, the image of the Besht as friend of the common man was picked up by R. Yosef Yitzhak in his creative memoirs and stories, and then further used by Yisrael Yaakov Klapholtz.  It was also picked up in 1930’s US by Levin and Shnitzer. They fill out the details of how the Besht was a proponent of education for girls, was a democrat, and a rationalist.<br />
(I am not discussing Zweifel&#8217;s modernizations nor Buber&#8217;s view of an elite mystic, rather the friend of the common man.)</p>
<p>So obviously there is a need for a source and authority for change. Many times when a generation cannot turn to the prior generation they pick a distant figure to idealize. What are the contours of this new image of the Besht?  It certainly has Chabad elements. Is it only a transitional image to something else? Is this different than when the generation of the 1920&#8217;s chasidic youth lost faith in their parents and the Piesetzna rebbe told them to consider &#8220;as if&#8221; the patriarchs and prior ages were their parents? Or many modern groups that choose Maimonides? I do feel it has a different feel, a lack of an &#8220;As if&#8221;&#8221; quality. Any thoughts?</p>

				<p>Here is an interesting interfaith moment of a frum couple from Bergen county finding themselves on Turkish TV. I knew of this as soon as it occurred but was waiting for the You Tube.  The couple are interested in Jewish Muslim reconciliation and were in correspondence with Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) and visited him and found themselves recorded for posterity. Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) is the leading Turkish creationist rejecting secular Turkey and the more rational Islamic approaches. Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) has a rich debate around him on the web. Look at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Oktar">wiki page</a> and the <a href="http://commentsaboutadnanoktar.com/">Anti-Wiki pages.</a> and <a href="http://whoisharunyahya.wordpress.com/category/adnan-oktar/">hate sites against him.</a> Was he anti-Semitic and then saw the light after a prison term and is now pushing for Jewish-Muslim reconciliation? Was he imprisoned and placed in a psycho ward as a set-up victim of the state or did he deserve it? <a href="http://newhumanist.org.uk/2131/sex-flies-and-videotape-the-secret-lives-of-harun-yahya">Here is a critical article.</a></p>
<p>Update<br />
Gil Amminadav writes to me after reading the links on this post. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had read some of the allegations against Harun Yahya before (as well as his group&#8217;s responses), but nothing as emphatic as that Humanist article! It was a very well-written piece.  If we had read all of this before agreeing to meet with him, I can&#8217;t say that it would have changed anything; we believe that part of the purpose of cultivating a sensitivity towards negative and defamatory speech is to remind us that, when all is said and done, there is quite a lot said, and not nearly as much actually known.  Even with truth to a single allegation, we are not interested in judging, we are interested in working.  Another&#8217;s personal failures serve to remind us of our own &#8211; narcissism is hardly a unique trait.  All in all, the man struck us as sincerely interested in promoting friendship and fellowship, from within his own cultural context, and for that we give him much credit and hope that he inspires others to do the same, God willing.  If he has an imbalanced sexuality or mistreats others in any way, then we hope that God brings him &#8220;a healing of soul and a healing of body,&#8221; and that anyone who feels harmed by him is brought the same.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Elana and Gil Amminadav run Derusha Publishing, an indie  publishing house based in New Jersey. Among their publications is <a href="http://www.derushapublishing.com/the-naked-crowd.shtml">Hakham Jose Fauer&#8217;s recent book</a>. &#8220;So here are these young Jewish seekers who didn&#8217;t realize they were going to broadcast our  conversation until we actually sat down. I am not sure what to make of it. This stuff is going on all the time. Here is the TV interview in two parts. </p>

<p><a href="http://us1.harunyahya.com/Detail/T/EDCRFV/productId/23466/ADNAN_OKTAR_S_LIVE_INTERVIEW_WITH_JEWISH_GUESTS_FROM_DERUSHA_PUBLISHING_(USA)_ON_HARUNYAHYA.TV_(APRIL_14,_2010)">From the transcript:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Look. See how Islam resembles Judaism? The fact they resemble one another stems from their being the same in the faith of the Prophet Abraham (pbuh) and very ancient Sunna, insha&#8217;Allah.</p>
<p>GIL AMMINADAV: Yes, even more. It is a river and everyone drinks from the river. And some people drink from here and some people drink from there. But it is the same river. Beyond Abraham (pbuh), Ishmael (pbuh), Isaac (pbuh) and Jacob (pbuh) and all these beyond today, you have people drinking from the same river and know. Unfortunately, it seems we have seen a lot of people, unfortunately a lot of Israeli, has forgotten. We are supposed to be the people of memory but we have forgotten. But we are now remembering</p>
<p>GIL AMMINADAV: We have a sheikh, a tzadik  (righteous teacher). His name was Rabbi Nachman ben Feiga, very nice person. He talks about the flip (sudden change) from this world order to the next world order. Inthe blink of an eye. No guns, no tanks, no missiles, just prayer</p>
<p>ELANA AMMINADAV: We also find that a lot of times we are looking forsomething called mussar, like instruction on how we can change ourselves. So when we find a Holy Book that teaches us or that points out things that might be problems in our people. Like things in the Qur&#8217;an talk about how the Jews might have worshipped their Rabbis. So then we can look at ourselves and say, why someone would say that to us, and that can teach us how to change and how to make ourselves better. </p></blockquote>
<p>Gil&#8217;s statement afterward:</p>
<div>&#8220;We believe it is worthwhile for human beings to see  the benefit in making religion a positive, unifying, and enriching  force in their lives and in their relationships.  Meetings between those  people who speak the language of friendship are key components of the  widespread change unfolding around us.  We were honored to reflect upon  the sanctity of Judaism, Islam, and other expressions of humanity&#8217;s  relationship with God, for those who find sanctity in them, with Mr.  Harun Yahya, a delightful, spiritually-sensitive educator and communal  leader in Istanbul.  We hope that as human beings recognize more of each  other in themselves, we will enter the next chapter of human history  with a liberating new vision of the future.&#8221;</div>
<p><strong><br />
For a sense of how common this is becoming. Harun Yahya has had many Israeli guests on his show</strong> including members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_attempt_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin">current attempted Sanhedrin.</a> A national Haredi yearning for the Ottoman Empire?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/images/1/1f/Hachrazah_5769_Kislev_15c.pdf">From the transcript:</a><br />
<a href="http://en.harunyahya.tv/videoDetail/Lang/4/Product/19282/ADNAN_OKTAR_AND_SANHEDRIN_RABBIS_ON_LIVE_TV_PROGRAM_%28DECEMBER_1,_2009%29">The video is here:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>RABBI ABRAHAMSON: Hello, my name is Benyamin Abrahamson. I am an orthodox Chassidic Jew from Israel. And I work as a historian or a kind of consultant to the court in Jerusalem that Rabbi Hollander is talking about. Mostly people here know me from my<br />
endless discussions about the similarities between the Islam and Jewish customs. I enjoy talking about the Hadiths, Tabari, Ibn Hisham and al-Waqidi, and talking about the kings of Himyar as I much as I enjoy talking about the Midrash Rabbah, the Midrashei Geulah,<br />
Rambam, Tosefos or the Shulchan Aruch. I like very much to talk about the common shared customs between Islam and Judaism, about the similarities in architecture between the masjid and the synagogue, between the similarities of the calendar, holidays and customs. But it is<br />
clear to me that there is more than just similarities, that they obviously go back to a common root and a common faith.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do we make of this reapproachment? It is not the commonality of Jews living in Arab lands or of neighbors. It is not exactly dialogue, theology, or formulated views. And it is happening on the margins. Help me make sense of the implications. I do not want to discuss the people involved, just the encounter.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Chapter 3 of Radical Torah is on Torah and revelation. Torah points to the oneness of all reality and mitzvah is our sense of what creates holiness in our lives.<br />
Green’s radical views on Torah go back to some of his first public statement.</p>
<p>In the 1960’s, the pulpit Rabbi David Hartman raised money to host annual SEGAL retreats in Quebec.  The invitation list included depending on the year Rav Aharon Lichtenstein, Elie Wiesel, Emil Fackenheim, and Rabbis Wurzburger, Yitz Greenberg, Berkovits , Jacob Petuchowski, and Seymour Segal.  The responses to each other’s positions formed the backbone of 1960’s Jewish theology.  (Forty years later, a cross denominational retreat like this might once again force theologians to articulate their differing and mutually exclusive positions ).</p>
<p>In 1969, a young Arthur Green spoke to these assembled elders as a representative of youth culture. And the June 23 1969 issue of the NYT gave a lion’s share of its write up of the retreat to Green, who set out a radical position that his generation was  looking for the sacred but he does not know if the traditional answer of eating beef is more holy than eating pig. Maybe today God’s voice is for us to eat natural foods or not to use cellophane or not to use migrant worker grapes. </p>
<p>A decade later in the <em>Second Jewish Catalog</em> , Green offered a subjective guide to religious practice, and scandalized the establishment for a Conservative rabbi to accept free love </p>
<p>In his first version of Green theology in the book, <em>Seek My Face,</em> the section on revelation was weaken than the section on creation.<br />
In the second version of the book,<em> E-hyeh,</em> Green calls himself heterodox to distinguish himself from any sense of institutional obligation of practice.  This third version of Green&#8217;s thought is more mystical and pantheistic.</p>
<p>The message of the  Torah, read with mystic eyes, is that God alone exists as taught by the mystics in all religions This mystic oneness needs reinforcement  through the world of the symbolic sefirot. Hasidic readings of the text are clearly the most useful in this scheme.<br />
We cannot accept the world of the kabbalists as real science anymore but modern science does not have all the answers. We don’t know everything about reality but we cant take Kabbalah literally.The greatest insight of  kabbalh today  is psychological  teaching about divine oneness. Torah is a  vehicle for mystical consciousness.</p>
<p>From an Orthodox perspective, it would be unfair to judge a proclaimed heterodox position on Torah, revelation, and law.  But what is lacking here from any perspective is the role of kabbalah as meaning creating in a post-foundational sense (see my last post). Green moves between ascribing an intellectualist approach to medieval kabbalah and concludes that it is fluid and symbolic.  However, there is no need to situate kabbalah in the science-religion debate in post-secular age. I am not comfortable when he says that science has gaps in its explanatory power so he turns to kabbalah. Why are science and kabbalah even in  the same discussion from a liberal perspective? If science is weak in immunology, cosmology, or oncology then the solution will come from further laboratory work, not by turning to the kabbalah to show that we can accept mystery in life.  And the kabbalah is not symbolic because we have physics but because it has nothing to do with science. </p>
<p>[If one want to deal with the kabbalistic science of the Gra,  R. Moshe Shapiro, and the Kabbalah Centre that  would be a completely different discussion and focused on Orthodox thought.] </p>
<p>His view of revelation is as mystic teaching in our hearts. He explains this using Hasidic texts- that they only heard the aleph of creation on Sinai, meaning the mystic oneness of reality.  </p>
<p>Green acknowledges that he is far from any traditional view and discusses that he has a God of disbelief, silent in our lives, and at best a projection for our needs. But he says that he really does accept revelation, a revelation of a God who pulsates as a wholeness of being in creation – inward in all things, an energy for evolution.This silent existence of God is everywhere So mitzvah are from this silent  inwardness of creation and self. A panentheistic commander of mizvot.  Green admits that this needs &#8220;unpacking,&#8221; which is his term. Mizvot are not a custom or folkway but to produce holiness and  opportunity for encounter. Mizvot are a set of symbols to address the soul. Israel’s myth of sacred beginning.</p>
<p>Green considers Sinai as a great growth in religious consciousness and human awareness for freed slaves and the immediate commandment of not to have idolatry makes sense in their not wanting anything that constricts our minds.<br />
But there is No God who makes a covenant with Israel. Only the One who calls from the heart to make this people his own. Green acknowledges that this is too personified and particualistic since God is revealed in all hearts, of all people &#8211; all revelation is based on culture. Israel said yes in the Sinai of the heart and the mind- Jews respond to an inner call. Jews are a channel for divine presence and blessing. No matter how secular they seem, Jews are priests at the alter of God.</p>
<p>Green asks: But does this mean that Sinai was merely human ? His answer : No, God is in the human heart The covenant is mutual, God is bound to it and we are promised by God that He will love us, the more you give the more you get. He has faith in reward.</p>
<p>I do not recognize traditional concepts of Torah, mizvot, and Sinai in Green’s presentation But then again he is proudly heterodox and speaks to those who are spiritual not religious.  For crucial questions of canon, authority, and interpretation, Halbertal- remains the starting point. And for the meaning of Kabblah, sod, religious experience and  Biblical exegesis, Fishbane is the place to start. But Green offers openness to the spirit and the therapeutic deism that guides contemporary lives. </p>
<p>Yet, before I let this chapter go, and post this review -I feel not satisfied. The Hasidism is not historical hasidism, the response to Biblical criticism seems fluffy, and the definition of mysticism is self-defined as his own unity of being unable to hold up in a study of mysticism. I might be faulted for wanting things more academic. Is this chapter just that he likes haimish language of Torah and mizvot and his pantheistic oneness of being is a justification for haimishness? I dont know! Martin Buber was a serious heterodox engagement with Torah, rigorous in history and philosophy.  I have a gut feeling that this chapter reads like the homiletic logic so common in Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>I do know that many people are performing searches for Art Green&#8217;s new book, few for Fishbane, and even fewer for Novak. So it must be speaking to people?</p>
<p><strong>Do I have any heterodox readers to evaluate this?</strong></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>A book that is getting many good reviews from both academics and religious publications is  David Holly, Meaning and Mystery. Holly approaches the question of the belief in God from a post-secular and post liberal perspective, God is part of our lives in a  non-foundational way and the criteria for believe is whether God is part of our narrative. He takes from Charles Taylor the idea that we all create narratives or social imaginaries to make meaning of our lives. He also takes from all the new studies on evangelicals that people adopt Evangelical beliefs because it fits into their personal narratives.  Hence, belief in God is non-foundational and based on our personal histories. God cannot be proved or disproved. Neither philosophy or science play a role in the belief in God. Someone who does not have God in their life cannot communicate with someone who does since they have different life stories.  He does invoke Pascal and cheer for belief in ways that don’t fit with Charles Taylor, but many points of his are good. He seems to be working on a sequel on how the question of falsification is dealt with in a personal narrative approach. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=93175">Here is a review from a religious publication.</a><br />
<em><br />
ONE of the myths of post-modernism is that we have entered the age of no meta-narratives.<br />
Non¬sense. We are in the age of many meta-narratives.  David Holley doesn’t even bother with the modern/post-modern question. He simply argues that it is these “life-orienting” meta-narratives that determine belief in God, or otherwise. This is the thesis expounded clearly and credibly in the first chapter, so that there is a certain inevitability about his attack on the “God of the Philosophers” who is the end point of a logical or empirical argument rather than an idea central to a life-orienting narrative that is accepted because it makes sense of experience, and is a plausible and practical guide for action. </p>
<p>Holley maintains that atheism is as dependent as theism on such life-orienting narratives.. Of course, such narratives require a degree of receptivity on our part if they are to be life-orienting, and it is in the nature of human freedom that they should be capable of being resisted.</p>
<p>Holley effectively exposes the worst excesses of rationalism and scientism that characterize many contemporary despisers of religion. Here he owes a significant debt to Alexander MacIntyre when it comes to seeing the very idea of virtues and values as incompatible with a purely naturalistic version of reality.<br />
This leaves the way clear for him to demonstrate how narratives that include God are more likely to offer meaning to our lives than those that do not.<br />
The final chapter deals with how we relate to religious and non-religious views other than our own. Holley contends that trying to evaluate various world-views from a standpoint outside any of them is impossible. We can address them only from within the life-orienting narrative we have adopted, and that way we can accommodate doubt and uncertainty without compromising the narrative that works for us. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://religioncompass.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/books-meaning-and-mystery-what-it-means-to-believe-in-god">From a scientific study of religion review interview:</a></p>
<p><em>What’s the central concern of the book, and why is it important?<br />
DH: While the question of God’s existence is typically dealt with as a theoretical issue, I claim that it makes most sense to treat it as a practical question. Each of us needs what I call a life-orienting story, a narrative that relates a picture of what is ultimately real to individual experience in a way that makes a particular way of living intelligible and attractive. Some narratives of this kind include God and some explicitly exclude God. Reflective judgment about God occurs in the context of considering alternative narratives that might provide orientation for a way of living. In that context the issue is not only whether the understanding provided by a narrative coheres with what we take to be the facts, but whether or not it has the power to engage a person in a way of life she finds worthy. </p>
<p>And what is it that draws you (personally) to this topic?<br />
DH: I am struck by the way religious claims and religious ways of life seem virtually unintelligible to some people. In the introduction to the book I cite one author who questions whether anyone actually believes in God because he thinks of the belief as a hypothesis that lacks any evidential support. Both believers and unbelievers are tempted to construe the issue in this way, and as a result the discussion gets sidetracked from the kind of belief intelligent religious people hold and the considerations that actually persuade them. </p>
<p>What sort of reaction do you hope it will get?<br />
DH: I would like to persuade people that standard ways of thinking about God’s existence do not get to the heart of the matter. I’d like to reconfigure the discussion between believers and nonbelievers away from arguments about an isolated proposition to consideration of alternative narratives that might structure a way of life. I expect that some people will misunderstand my book, imagining that I am advocating some kind of disregard of rational evidence. Instead, I am trying to show what kind of reflection is appropriate for cases where we inevitably end up believing some practical narrative (naturalistic or theistic) that cannot be established on purely empirical grounds. </em></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Clergy regularly publish op-eds and sermons about how we will never know why evil happens, nevertheless we have to rise to  respond to the suffering. Many times these sermons are treated by those who quote it as brilliant innovation. Sometimes even the author praises himself in his own op-ed for his own deep insight and sublime rationality. Yet, as long as we have vocal clergy who blame earthquakes, volcanoes, and floods on the sins of the country, then it sustains these op-ed writers in their sense of superiority.  However, the distinction between theodicy and our need to respond was a common theme of most existential authors.  Sarah K. Pinnock , <em>Beyond Theodicy: Jewish and Christian Continental Thinkers Respond to the Holocaust</em> (2002) surveys this topic.</p>
<p>The book is eight years old, but I finally got around to reading it.  Pinnock contextualizes nicely by surveying the deterioration of the belief in theodicy entering the 20th century and the new attempts by evangelical philosophers to restore theodicy. The majority of the book is on the four opinions of Marcel, Buber, Bloch (via Moltmann) and Metz.  The book started as a dissertation and would not be good reading, to put it mildly, for those not used to academic reading.</p>
<p>The first position that she presents is Gabriel Marcel , who rejects theodicy but claims that we need to accept mystery of God  without an attempt at justification. The goal is empathy and meaning  in our lives; not to prevent suffering or protest.  There are similarities to Victor Frankl and Erich Fromm.</p>
<p>The second position that she presents is Martin Buber, who has a greater collective sense than Marcel. For Marcel, meaning is personal, while for Buber meaning is to better the world. In the prophetic faith of Judaism  one engages in moral acts, prayer, protest in the face of suffering which builds community. Buber introduces the discussion of how Job is a better source for today than Isaiah’s suffering servant. Finally, Buber speaks of how we rise from fate to destiny when we orient our lives around God.  When we live in an I-thou toward others and build a community of destiny then even fate is transformed “Fate—with its eyes, hitherto severe, suddenly full of light—looks like grace itself” (102). (On the near complete reliance of Soloveitchik  on some of these paragraphs of Buber, a different review would be needed.)</p>
<p>Pinnock’s goal was to compare the existentialists with the Marxists, so her next thinker was Bloch’s concept of hope as used by Jurgen Moltmann. Hegel downplayed suffering.  The role of hope in Bloch and Moltmann is to bring the fate of history in correspondence with the destined redemption.  Moltmann  offers a mystical solidarity of man and God. For Moltmann, the Christian cross shows how to suffer in a meaningful way and shows the real possibility for redemption. The Marxist hope mandates a need for change or at least dignity before death. </p>
<p>Finally, Metz  rejects the parallel of human to divine suffering.  Human suffering is about painful despair, hopeless, and futility. It means broken shattered  lives. To use a Jewish example, the pain of the slaughter of children in the Holocaust is not just an exile of the shekhinah or God crying. Metz introduces the theme of memory, where one has to integrate the  truth of past into one’s life and in addition to investigate the causes of the suffering. The goal is to change the world, to protest, to investigate the socio-political causes of the pain, and to create a better society. </p>
<p>She concludes her book with comparisons during which she asks: Are these existential answers philosophy, psychology, or pastoral care?  Certainly, many of the clergy versions are sheer pastoral comfort and should not be praised as philosophy. (Hashem yirahem)</p>
<p>The best part of the book is now the ability to analyze the options of the theologians who write that that we respond to suffering in the real world. Does the essay state that we respond in personal meaning, in building community, in restoring dignity, or to actually change the world? What did the author stress and what did the author leave out. Do we change the world or ourselves? Do we have to empathize with the sufferer or only help them? These distinctions allow us to stand on their shoulders and formulate better responses and responses that actually address the suffering at hand.  If the book would be expanded, I would have liked to see chapters on Camus, Tillich, Benjamin, and Ricoeur since these authors are already making many cameos. A full comparison would be helpful for fleshing out the existential ethic.</p>

				<p><strong>Priest Religious, But Not Really Spiritual</strong><br />
May 5, 2010 | ISSUE 46•18</p>
<p>BOSTON—Father Clancy Donahue of St. Michael Catholic Church told reporters Wednesday that while he believed in blindly adhering to the dogma and ceremonies of his faith, he tried not to get too bogged down by actual spirituality. &#8220;I&#8217;m not so much into having a relationship with God as I am into mechanically conducting various rituals,&#8221; Donahue said. &#8220;To me, it just feels empty to contemplate a higher power without blindly obeying canon law and protecting the church as an institution.&#8221; Donahue emphasized that although he did not personally agree with those who pondered the eternal, he had nothing against them.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Here is a link to a cute video on how to be an Evangelical. It is similar to the books and spoofs on how to act and speak yeshivish. </p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='500' height='282' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4H-29cJSuv8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>However <a href="http://missivesfrommarx.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-evangelical-habitus/">it is quoted on a religion blog</a> to discuss how religion is learning to follow set patterns of speaking according to its habitus (in Bourdieu’s sense) rather than its doctrines. Meaning a year in Israel is about learning to speak a certain way.  Now, that is not the end of the story. The blog has a commenter </p>
<blockquote><p>While it is worthwhile to consider the extent to which a cult, sect, denomination or ecclesia can be identified by its various styles of habitus, it is also useful to consider the concept of “ortho-praxy.” Every collectivity, sacred or secular, has its subtle aspects of orthodox social action (social behavior, G. H. Mead).<br />
Ortho-praxy (orthopraxy) is a concept frequently used in the study of religions and spiritualities, including comparative religious studies as an inter-disciplinary field and the sociology of religion as a section of the ASA. </p></blockquote>
<p>The way he is using the term orthopraxy in a GH Mead sense is as an acquired was to speak and conduct social interaction. People we call believers are those who have learned to have the correct acquired way to talk. The one who learns catch phrases like &#8220;baal teshuvah&#8221; “your not yotze”“it is against the mesorah” “it is a kiyyum” &#8220;one has to do teshuvah&#8221; are the orthopraxy, since they have correctly learned how to practice a way of speech.  On the other side, those who stop speaking like that and don’t accept that way of labeling are not the orthoprax since they are no longer speaking correctly.<br />
From a sociological perspective, Orthoprax is not about keeping halakhah but about acting and talking like a believer. Those correctly acculturated are orthopraxy, those who stop speaking correctly  even if they keep halakhah would not be orthoprax. Skepticism, rationality, liberalism or disinterest all cause one to speak differently to other people.  When discussing Evangelicals, researchers like John G. Stackhouse, Jr. consider orthopraxy part of the correct beliefs, when one no longer believes then one is not orthoprax.</p>
