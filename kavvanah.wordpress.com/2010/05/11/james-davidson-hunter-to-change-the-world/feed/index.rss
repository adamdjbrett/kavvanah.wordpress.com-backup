Boltanski would be a way to go. I would also think Leclau. One could offer an alternate analysis but Hunter is really good at getting actual reality correct.

I hear your Adorno thoughts in the background of your questions. What would Adorno say to Hunter? After the last few decades what can still be heard?]]></description>

Well there is always the question of social reproduction vs. critique and progress; nowadays this is something like Bourdieu vs. his student Boltanski. One could frame is as Schelling vs. Hegel if you wanted to.

Second, maybe I am setting the stakes a bit too high. I wonder if you think this is really even about the moments of normativity and critique (and post Bourdieu even Boltanski et al have moments, not whole worlds of Habermas style norms) or the moments of Will and Grace, however those will be thought about?]]></description>

I think you are running a littel quickly to the trotskyites. You are correct that non of the provincialism is worth anything in the public sphere but there are many broader cases.
Supreme court members bring in their religion.  Academics like the list of Christian academics that I posted earlier in month affect society.  Jewish academics who make in to the Institute for Advanced Study and get to Aspen seminars like Michael Waltzer affect society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[chakira,
&lt;em&gt;I guess what I am saying is that Hunter is arguing for a remarkable degree of complicity with what I see as a continual reproduction of capitalist domination.&lt;/em&gt;

Hunter is a good collector of data and is very good at reading our current religious climate. No one would have believed how accurate his Culture Wars was going to be. I take this book very very seriously becuase he has a track record of reading the data correctly. If so, then yes American religion will be entirely co-opted by culture without the ability to offer an outside critique.

The critique offered wont be Barth but Niebuhr- one that works within the current institutions.]]></description>

Right but he still is enumerating a vision of the stakes vastly different than the one I enumerated. Someone commented that there is a current generational tic to make every small thing scale up into a societal issue. So I am wondering why I sped past individual and institutional levels straight to society and if maybe I should have slowed down like AS did and first thought about will and grace. Maybe I just have a tic, or maybe there is something to these large narratives about religion and complicity that I am sketching.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love how the stakes of my comment are about the structuration of society, mega trends in religion as critique vs. the assimilation of religious legitimacy to dominant societal powers. And then AS bursts my bubble talking about Will and Grace, Srugim.

I wonder where people see the stakes of religion allying itself with various cultural forces? I think if one were to critique my own somewhat shrill comment, it might be on the basis that I ignored any mediating level of institutions. Maybe this middle level is where the stakes are at?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post depresses me. The reason it depresses me has to do with the potential of religion as a site for critical claims. I see this as the only way religion is salvageable. Thus, I see the collapse of this critical potential as a depressing commentary on religion. 

Let me unpack.

Hunter&#039;s statement that cultural change is a top down affair ignores the entire critical potential of Christian discourse. This begins with the setting off of Civitas Dei vs. Civitas Terrena in Augustine. There, we see a robust discourse of critique against the excesses, human toll, and stupidity of Imperial life.  The robust critique only works if we have some ideal higher than the dominant reproduction of power to point to. In other words, if we are assuming that critical discourses like Christianity are going to participate in the hierarchical reproduction of social distinction, we are also concomitantly seeing them not as sites for normative claims, but merely as more engines of social reproduction. I guess what I am saying is that Hunter is arguing for a remarkable degree of complicity with what I see as a continual reproduction of capitalist domination. And, in turn, this complicity would destroy the residual claims to truth we might find in religions. Finally, it is not a coincidence that a robust critique of the iron cage of modernity has come from an evangelical milieu. A cursory look at the Christ centric theology of someone like Barth (or HUvBalthasar vs. Barth) shows a principled rejection of the accommodation that Barth saw as characteristic of Roman Catholicism. This begins, for Barth, with the scholastic analogia entis. Put another way by Schmitt, it is the complexio oppisotorum which allows Augustine himself to mitigate the normative claims he makes and split the difference with the empire.

In any case, perhaps I have given the only and best reason not to be too depressed by this call for complicity with an unacceptable schema of domination. The very fact that robust critique both can slide into complicity and arise again shows that this is not  a decisional moment for critique in the guise of religion. Even if we get more Evangelicals packing the court, running Goldman Sachs and filling the Ivies, we can be sure that the germ of critique implicit in some religious texts will be picked up by someone, sometime in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am much more interested in the production of mass culture. There is an important question, and I wonder if the book really answers this: why is there so little christian material in popular culture-particularly on television? Given that the people in TV shows are overwhelmingly white, the number of characters who are identifiably Christian in any meaningful way are few indeed. Are the culture makers predominantly secular  Jews and Protestants and lapsed Catholics?

Clearly the presence of gay characters has mainstreamed gays in a way that has helped their political cause, but would the same be true for devout evangelicals if there was a surge in their representation on TV? 

I think that the answer is no. First, representation in popular culture helps to reduce the otherness of marginalized groups. That is not exactly a problem that Christianity has. Second, in order to be compelling, fictional characters need to be flawed, and officially religions tend not to wants to see a flawed reflection of their ideals on TV. Third, and here I am being very judgmental, a lot of Evangelicalism filtered into mass media (and I base this on listening to christian radio and watching christian cable on a semi-regular basis) borders on kitsch. So I think that the potential for unintentional self-parody is quite high (Watch the &quot;Left Behind&quot; movies).

As far as the orthodox community, I think we have an interesting experiment going on in Israel with the success of Srugim. I would predict that the show ill have little effect on religious life in Israel , but may change the way that some chilonim see the urban dati l&#039;umi, perhaps as more of an Israeli cultural subgroup whose life experiences mostly overlap with their non-religious fellow citizens. than a wholly different other community. The lack of any hareidi characters whatsoever clearly sends a message that it is a group that constitutes an entirely distinct group that does not even appear to interact with urban datiim.]]></description>
