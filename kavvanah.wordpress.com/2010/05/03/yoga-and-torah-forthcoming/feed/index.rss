Yasher koach Tzvi for the great article!  I&#039;m curious why Chabad.org censored your article. Did they ever publish an explanation for the suppression or a rebuttal of your response?]]></description>

Jewish Yoga: Experiencing Flexible, Sacred, and Jewish Bodies
Celia Rothenberg‌


ABSTRACT: This article delineates and explores three distinctive, although frequently overlapping forms of &quot;Jewish yoga&quot;: Judaicized yoga, Hebrew yoga, and Torah yoga. Each of these is an evolving system of mental, spiritual, and physical experiences based both on yogic practices and on a variety of Jewish teachings as interpreted by different Jewish yoga teachers. To contextualize the development and spread of all types of Jewish yoga, I begin by briefly discussing the Jewish Renewal Movement and hatha yoga in North America today. Then, one example of a Judaicized yoga class is explored through interviews and participant observation with a small group of dedicated students in western Canada. These students work to extend the meaning of the female religious body beyond the halachically observant to one that is &quot;flexible,&quot; sacred, and Jewish. Finally, conceptualizations of Hebrew and Torah yoga are outlined by drawing on the perspectives of key practitioners and their writings.]]></description>
