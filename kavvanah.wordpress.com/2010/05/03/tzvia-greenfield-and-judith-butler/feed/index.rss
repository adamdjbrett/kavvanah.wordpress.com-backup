					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/tzvia-greenfield-and-judith-butler/#comment-943&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/a&gt;.

Judith has what to contribute to discussions of normativity as any other critical theorist does. What might be worth tuning out is precisely the critique of violence, levinas meets Israel stuff. This stuff is tangential to her greater recognitive schema. The latter is sketched quite powerfully in books like Psychic Life, and we would be profoundly dumb to not use these insights in any political formation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Moshe Halbertal already noted around 12 years the &quot;normalization&quot; of both the Dati L&#039;Umi &#038; Hareidi world and their rejection of Messianic discourse.

Perhaps Greenfield is the flip side of the claim of Chareidim  that they are the true Zionist and their adoption of Nationalist claims. If being a Chareidi is no longer about rejecting the State as being a heresy, but being no different than any other secular state, you can adopt any position vis a vis the state, including Greenfields.

The interesting thing about her position is that it views Israel with neither the classic Eastern European position of viewing the state as non-Jewish and the Jews (or Chareidim) as a self-contained minority nor as a particular Jewish state, but to treat it is any other country.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please excuse the following rant: 

It takes very little real courage to critique Israel today. You aren&#039;t some lone voice of dissent; you are instantly ingratiating yourself into a anti zionist academic and intafada-chic love fest; you have the benefit of at least one person calling you a self-hating Jew, so so you get instant credibility there and get to consider yourself among the pantheon of great accused self-hating Jews; you can even travel around Israel and meet plenty of like minded people. 

In short you have access to an instantly coherent and ready-made identity. There is no tension, no angst, no night sweats.  It is utterly and completely facile. 

In any event, I think that Greenfield&#039;s bifurcation of religion and the state is probably born more from a recognition that Israeli politics has devolved into a dysfunctional muddle of short-sighted special interest deal-making and pandering - much of which revolves around placating various religious factions. (America may have been trying to bring American-style Democracy to Iraq; instead they recreated the Knesset). 

All the fist shaking from abroad and self-flagellating from within about resolving the Palestinian problem is meaningless without reinventing Israel&#039;s political machinery. Liberal Israeli&#039;s spend too much time in a state of existential self negation without seriously rethinking the way their government is structured and agitating for that kind of low level change.

My Roadmap to peace starts with an Israeli constitutional convention - and for that you will get a lot more mileage from reading some of the nitty-gritty  Rawls and Habermas and ignoring those who project everything political onto a plane of symbolic interaction that has become so abstracted that it might as well be called a new metaphysics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would associate this view of torah as atemporal, therefore talk of bias is a mistake  with the use of Brisker conceptual analysis in the philosophy of RJBS. As we know RJBS held  there is no place for historicism or sociology in our understanding of Torah. Torah is apriori and must be understood as pure halacha, and not  by its use and effects in our daily lives. In the discussion of the RCA decision on women rabbis on Hirhurim  many people said they agree feminist criticism of torah is off limits, citing the Rav. This could be as a convention of sorts, that enables some to say female rabbis are yehuraig val yavor. But my reading is that most think torah is immune from sociological analysis because of its transcendental a temporal quality. If you need a yekke, maybe an aspiring lamdan like Rabbi Shimon Schwab would be a better pick. 

On why Greenfield thinks Butler is relevant to her is beyond me. When Butler was darshening gender as a performative was she also inspired by her Jewish quest for justice? Maybe Greenfield  used Butler for shock value. Her core description of the Israeli dilemna  is valid enough that it needs no support from Butler. Her position is actually almost identical with the ideas of Bernard Avishai.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/tzvia-greenfield-and-judith-butler/#comment-922&quot;&gt;chakira&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems this will be Butler&#039;s 2011 book.

&lt;strong&gt;“The Critique of Violence and Other Jewish Quandaries”: A Study of Jewish Criticisms of State Violence and Dispossession in the Twentieth Century, Focusing on Walter Benjamin, Martin Buber, Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi, and Emmanuel Levinas.&lt;/strong&gt;

This study considers several twentieth-century Jewish thinkers who offered public criticisms of state violence and encountered the risks and obligations of making such public claims. A deliberate consideration of major Jewish intellectuals, including Walter Benjamin, Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, Hannah Arendt, and Primo Levi, yields critical perspectives on state violence formulated through ideals derived from Jewish philosophical or religious thought or from twentieth-century reflections on dispossession and genocide. Public criticisms against gratuitous state violence, arguments in favor of co-habitation, and opposition to dispossession constitute important, if underappreciated, dimensions of Jewish values.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The attempt on the part of Judith to make herself over into a Jewish philosopher following  Levinas et al has not convinced me. Looking at a book like Precarious Life, it is not at all clear what function the Levinasian face argument serves. Butler would not embrace a transcendant in the way Levinas would. Even as she realizes that the action is with the religious theopolitical stuff (this is changing very fast) she has no way to incorporate it into her very Hegelian, recognitive reappropriation of critical theory. For Tzvia not to see right through Judith&#039;s self proclaimed Judaism does not speak well to her understanding of our religion. Because where, really, does Judith Butler fit into Jewish Philosophy?]]></description>
