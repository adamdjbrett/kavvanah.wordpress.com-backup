					<description><![CDATA[The phenomenon of text-tampering is very disturbing and a reminder of how fragile truth is, considering who the trustees and gatekeepers of vast stores of the Rav&#039;s manuscripts are. People who have the ability to allow or deny access in accordance with their agendas also have the ability to selectively preserve or destroy material. This should give pause to both those who treat his texts as &quot;having a canonical status of their own&quot; and as well as those who concern ourselves with whether &quot;the parts don&#039;t all fit together&quot; or &quot;...Did he ever change his mind?&quot; 

Two belated comments, to follow one up that I posted on Yehudah Mirsky&#039;s piece in JID.  

-Ah, to be a student again.  Remember the &#039;70&#039;s when you first noticed the inconsistencies and enigmas in Orot, Orot HaKodesh, photocopies of Arpilei Tohar, Eder HaYakar, etc. and suspected that the fragments you saw were not really part of some organized and systematic vision that you were told about?  Kol Hakavod to all of you who are actually following through with this.]]></description>
