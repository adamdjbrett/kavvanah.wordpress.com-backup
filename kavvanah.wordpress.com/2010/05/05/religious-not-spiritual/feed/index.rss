					<description><![CDATA[I think that this is part of a modern/protestant bias against ritual and the notion religion imposing norms from the outside.

 To a Litvak, Yishayah Leibowitz in its most extreme form, such an approach to &quot;spirituality&quot; is quite compelling.

R. Amital more and more speaks in these terms in an effort to counter the haba&quot;kukism that so pervades Israeli religious youth. 

As one rabbi summed it up to me, &quot;these kids dont know what a mechayeiv is&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I often wonder if Some Orthodox rabbis would agree with this priest ,I would guess that some believe that there is  a danger in sprituality  since it can lead to deemphasis of Halacha this can be seen that often in our Yeshivah Cirriculum they do not discuss the Why Questions]]></description>
