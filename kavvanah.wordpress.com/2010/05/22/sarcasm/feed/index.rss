&quot;Sheindel, for a woman so pious you&#039;re a great skeptic.&quot;

&quot;An atheist&#039;s statement&quot; she rejoined. &quot;The more piety the more skepticism. A religious man comprehends this. Superfluity, excess of custom and superstition would climb like a choking vine on the Fence of the Law if skepticism did not continualy hack them away to make way for purity.&quot;]]></description>
