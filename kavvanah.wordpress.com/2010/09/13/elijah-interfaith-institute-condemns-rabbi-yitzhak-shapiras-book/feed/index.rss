					<description><![CDATA[Muslims in the U.S. and worldwide are routinely faulted for failing to condemn their terrorist. Jews--at minimum--have no moral ground from which to fault our Muslim neighbors if we won&#039;t stand up and reject Yitzhak Shapira and his terrorist enterprise.  Talmidei chachamim m&#039;arbim shalom b&#039;olam. If they&#039;re inciting violence in the world, they are not wise students (of halakhah).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The petition  did not just ask the Court to censure Rabbi Shapira,  but requested that  all copies of Torat ha-Meloekh be impounded and that   criminal charges be brought  against him. While I fully share   the sentiments expressed in the petiton, I do not believe  that attempting to  initiate  legal proceedings  was the best way ot go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you probably recall, last summer at the World Congress at the session on anti-gentile sources a certain scholar said that he would not publish anything relating to certain highly problematic views of a certain semi-prominent hareidi rabbi. The upshot is that most people outside of the very small subset of people who read this rabbis published work remain unaware of what he has written. 

What would the harm have been in ignoring Torat Hamelech instead of making it into a cause celebre?]]></description>
