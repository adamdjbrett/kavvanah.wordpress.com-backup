LEDs, Electricity, and Shabbos...

Further, the day of the printed book is coming to an end.  It won&#039;t happen in 6 months, but in 10 years, an actual printed book will be a rarity.  You&#039;re seeing University&#039;s phasing out text books in favor of eBooks, the Kindle/iPhone/iPad model of reading is dominant.

Most of the MO kids at University did study for classed on Shabbat, they&#039;d read for a few hours in the afternoon.  Take away that option, and school becomes REALLY REALLY hard.

When people are at a social function and call out a Mincha minyan, the people pulling out a pocket Siddur are fewer and fewer, more people Davin/Bensch from the Blackberry/other smart phone.

This needs to be worked out, because as books get rarer, it will become increasingly prohibitive to print books...  Unless you are delusional enough to think that the Orthodox community is large enough to sustain printing capabilities.  Only the largest houses own their own equipment (as opposed to limited runs), and as the number of print houses declines, the equipment will vanish or become VERY expensive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This from a survey of students in Orthodox high schools being conducted for NCSY:
 
Do you keep half-Shabbos  or full-Shabbos (basically, do you text on Shabbos), do you eat out at non-kosher restaraunts (and if so, by yourself, with friends or with family), have you been on Miami spring break and if so how would you describe your religiosity there? Is your Judaism meaningful to you? Why or why not? What (if anything) would make you care about your Judaism?

					<description><![CDATA[H Sragow&#039;s point re squeezing and selecting reminded me of a Maaseh Shehayah when I was a talmid in R Riskin&#039;s Talmud shiur.

R Riskin answered emphatically yes and reminded us that all of Halacha is rooted in sweating the details, as opposed to the gorgeous hashkafic details.]]></description>

1) Even if it&#039;s not biblical, it&#039;s a clear-cut rabbinic prohibition.
2) It is permanent, even if only saved as bits of data; look at the memory, not at the pixels, as that is how the writing is stored, even if on some external server.
3) I would argue, based on the Ran&#039;s position in his machloket with the Rashba regarding &quot;chak tokhot&quot; on Shabbat, that texting should be considered ketiva de-orayta on Shabbat.
4) My point was that in this entire discussion nobody even brought up the issue of writing, and that use of electricity is merely assumed to be the problematic issue.]]></description>

It&#039;s interesting that the intuitive rationale for considering texting to be prohibited is electricity; the far more (halakhically) obvious issue would be writing. I would tend to doubt that it can be obviated.
Yet, Len seems to be onto something in terms of the rationale of the &quot;Half Shabbos&quot;ers. Electricity is an integral part of the way that we think of Shabbat observance today, writing is not.]]></description>
