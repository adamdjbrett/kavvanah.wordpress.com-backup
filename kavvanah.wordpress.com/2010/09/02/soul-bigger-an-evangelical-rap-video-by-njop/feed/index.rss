					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think anybody is going to infer that you can expect John Landis-style line-dancing in the synagogue.   

Seems more like advocacy for karma in a multi-racial context (note the do-gooders&#039; varied skin colors).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, Eppy&#039;s version is better than the original.

Despite the repetition of the word &quot;repent,&quot; note the absence of God and personal spirituality. I counted five mitzvot being advocated by this video, four actions by which one can make one&#039;s soul bigger:

Cut up the credit cards and stop shopping -- don&#039;t know whether that&#039;s neocalvinism, making a virtue out of economic necessity, or just kicking the economy back into recession.
Give to charity.
Notice other people (though without risking any I-Thou interactions)
Call your mother and apologize. (Note that &quot;smashing the car&quot; is considered a side effect of &quot;partying&quot; and insensitivity rather than a symptom of an alcohol problem.
Go to synagogue for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur... where it is implied one can experience Gospel Music and mixed dancing
My Classical Reform grandfather would have heartily endorsed all of this.]]></description>
