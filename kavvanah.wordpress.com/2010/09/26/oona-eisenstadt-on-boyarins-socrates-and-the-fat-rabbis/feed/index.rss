					<description><![CDATA[I find it absolutely telling that one bit of the critique is that Levinas is more interesting, while my reading of the Talmud may be &quot;truer.&quot; I am not trying to be an interesting philosopher but to best characterize the Talmud. I find Levinas&#039;s readings as often as not nonsense vis-a-vis the text and am also not so impressed at their frequently racist and always sexist philosophical content either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have notes, but it was a general critique of Levinas. Instead of &quot;essentializing,&quot; Boyarin &quot;problematizies,&quot; etc. etc. I guess this is kind of obvious, in retrospect.  If I&#039;m not mistaken, the comment was elicited when someone  in the audience brought up Levinas.  I would add that Boyarin himself has repeatedly &quot;apologized&quot; for engaging in apologetics (one thinks especially of the introduction to Carnal Israel), but at the same time he always wants to get beyond apologetics. I think he may have seen Levinas as a sophisticated, un-apologetic  apologist.]]></description>
