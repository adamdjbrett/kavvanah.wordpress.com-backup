					<description><![CDATA[For those interested, R Sacks&#039;s newest book displays an almost pollyanish view of the future of anti Semitism, especially in the UK, and fails to understand that many mitzvos are built on the fact that we are commanded to live a different life than the Gentile world. No amount of &quot;why can&#039;t we all be friends despite our differences&quot; rhetoric can ever overcome that fact. For those interested in the deep roots of anti Semitism in the UK, one should read Anthony Julius&#039; &quot;The Trials of the Diaspora.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I reside in Charleston, SC - also called the &quot;Holy City&quot;- for our many different religions &#038; tolerance/acceptance of different folk.  Saying that the US is a &quot;tea party&quot; state is canard.  NOT everyone agrees with those misguided lemmings &#038; their politico agendas.  America has &quot;faith&quot; yet America has also lost faith, become misdirected &#038; totally self absorbed because a lot of people are indifferent &#038; a lot of people NEVER had &quot;religion&quot; (maybe it was because their parents dropped the ball).

[edited by site owner]

I&#039;m an American, Southern, Polish Jew who does NOT subscribe to any political party.  So please don&#039;t categorize all folks here as &quot;Teabaggers&quot; - they&#039;re completely deluded &#038; not even cohesive in their party, beliefs or agendas.  Our &quot;melting pot&quot; is a mixed bag of folks who for the most part try to live in harmony - but as we all know that isn&#039;t always the case.

Kindest regards,

					<description><![CDATA[H Sragow…With respect to your first point,  thesis #19 says “Virtual reality is seen as promoting the notions of infinite inter-substitutability and pure flux. Radical Orthodoxy takes these as threatening to destroy the beauty and teleology of the actual, and to remove both the capacity for sustained abstract reflection and direct sensual encounter with the embodied.” Remember Chabad’s mantra that the supernal lights can be accessed only through a davar gasmi lemataw meiasers tefucim. 
I remember reading  this  claim about speculative bubbles   but I forget where. I guess the thought is that where there in a culture permeated by religious values, there would be a natural restraint  not to lever beyond reason and natural prudence. The banking houses would not have allowed 40:1 loan- capital ratios, buyers would not have ever thought of buying expensive homes they could not afford and so on. 
The entire “official” 24 theses can be found here: http://elizaphanian.blogspot.com/2007/07/radical-orthodoxy-official-twenty-four.html
Not every thesis is to be taken literally. They seem to enjoy being in opposition to all ideas  post  the high middle ages, but these are totally modern people, well versed in Continental philosophy. Some of it is just posing for the sake of dramatic effect. 
A spirited defense of their anti- nominalist position can be found in Catherine Pickstok’s “After Writing.” Who ever knew the future of Western Civilization depends on how we understand essence and accident? In their passion for essentialism and substance and their aversion to  modernity they remind me of the Brisker branch of the Edah Hacharedis. 

M. Flax…You are correct. My mistake. It bothers me that now when you google “Rabbi Sachs Margaret Thatcher” my incorrect statement comes up first. I regret being responsible for spreading a falsehood.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EJ -- 

1) Technology is making geographic community recede in importance, compared to ideological community.   By participating in this blog, we have identified ourselves as sharing preferences, despite the fact that I might be in Tunis, and you in Sydney.   If that trend continues, a geographic community should be less and less able to e at enforce decorum.
2) Religions have a mixed record at promoting morality, and I&#039;m not aware of anything religion has to do with promoting macroeconomic goals.   

How would the Radical Orthodox address these points?   Does it even need to?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EJ-
You basically nailed it.  I have not had a chance or excuse to post on Radical Orthodoxy yet. 
I recommend your reading  Ulrich Beck, A God of One&#039;s Own (Sept, 2010)- His work is the new synthetic work and probably new starting text for these discussions. Beck discusses all of this Habermas, Pope Benedict, Red Torries and everything else. I will be posting on it after Hag.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rawlsian justice is a system of basic liberties coupled with a redistributive scheme. The new conservative vision, far more apparent in the UK  than in tea- party America, rejects this  model of individuals and markets limited only by a  govt. safety net and  tax code. This third way rejects both neo- liberalism and the welfare state, claiming the former is a cruel, winner take all system  while the welfare net and statism creates  a passivity that is corrupting. The new buzzwords are community, local initiatives,  civil society,  which are supposed to stand between the state and the market. I imagine this as a nation filled with little Borough Parks and Monseys.  These communities are governed by custom, tradition, religious leaders and emphasize absolute morality, honor and shame. Religion in public life will  magically prevent speculative bubbles, sin and vice, corruption and decadence. Without religion and communities in  public life, society will continue to deteriorate. 
Both the Pope and the Chief Rabbi, more or less in the same language, have accepted this vision. So have the new Anglican theological-political cadre called Radical Orthodoxy. From this cauldron we have a new political grouping , the Red Tories. These ideas were used as an ideological basis for the Cameron campaign, though so far no communitarian has been invited into the cabinet.
I find all of this fascinating. Can Rabbi Sachs, Margaret Thatcher’s favorite clergyman, the close advisor to Blair and Brown, morph once again into a Disraeli for our time? 
In the Habermas-Pope Benedict debate, Habermas basically changed ideas of a lifetime. He now realizes that accepting the Rawlsian idea that metaphysical arguments have no place in public life, prejudices the debate in favor of the secular. No more veil of ignorance. Each religious community brings to the public arena its own conception of the good, informed and created by its tradition, and yet because everyone is monotheistic, and decent a stable  equilibrium will prevail.  Halevai!]]></description>
