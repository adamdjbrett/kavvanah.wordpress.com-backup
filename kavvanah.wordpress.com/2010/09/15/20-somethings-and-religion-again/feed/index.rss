					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say I follow your reasoning here. Are you analogizing between employment and marriage? As I understand the relationship, non-Orthodox Jews (and increasingly, Orthodox Jews as well) defer marriage in favor of educational and career advancement, and because finding a Jewish mate or taking the journey from looking endogamously to being open to intermarrying takes a while.

Is it your contention that we should try to reverse the trend of late marriage?  I could agree with that, and my sense is that filling the institutional, educational, and Jewishly-social vacuum of the post-college pre-marriage period would indeed lead to somewhat earlier marriage too.  After all, to say that you see nothing wrong with young unmarrieds mingling with everyone else is to ignore that they choose not to, or at least to assign no validity to that choice.

We&#039;re dealing with a broad societal trend, not simply a local Jewish market failure. See the MacArthur Foundation&#039;s study on 20 somethings in the USA (http://www.transad.pop.upenn.edu/about/whatweknow.html). The Jewish community needs to define a place and role in Jewish life foe this transitional period, rather than wish that it goes away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[rejwewvenator...When people now become unemployed, they’re taking a more or less permanent hit to their level of human capital. We  build up human capital while we gain experience working on a job, but lose human capital when we’re displaced from a job. Economists think people today recognize they are suffering ever bigger drops in their human capital at the moment that they suffer a job displacement. Call it globalization. Time is the enemy both in careers and in marriage. Opportunities, possibilities diminish as we age. Prolonged periods of emerging adulthood are dangerous. If you want less unemployment in the work and shiduchim markets we should not create ever more generous permanent safety nets, which this article advocated. It’s not as if twenties-somethings are sitting in caves waiting for an occasional visitor. (See for example Serugim, the Israeli telenovela.) Making it even more comfy and cozy, prolongs the problem and creates worse outcomes. I see nothing wrong with the young unmarried mingling with everyone else.
Look at the proposed solutions. One guy wants to build an entirely new infrastructure offering increasingly compelling experiences. “We must design entirely new experiences and expectations.” The next guy wants authentic personal experiences that stimulate Jewish growth. The third more modestly expects the rabbis provide a forum where the emergers can forge a sense of meaning and find out who they are. He doesn’t explain how this is to be done without work and love.
Markets aren’t clearing properly. Aggregating all the segments into one category doesn’t help. This kind of branding might be a marketing strategy for the synagogues, but it doesn’t speak to the causes or solutions. That’s my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ej, in the non-Orthodox community, late marriage is the rule among men and women. Non-Orthodoxy Jewish women marry later and have children later than the US average by large margins. Consider that by age 19, 56% of non-Jewish women have had one or more children, while on 30% of Jewish women have done so - just the most dramatic example of a Jewish trend towards late marriage and family-rearing.

I also think that you are defining identity to mean affiliation, not identity as it is meant by psychologists and educators. I think Dr Brill&#039;s point is accurate. There&#039;s a generation of Jews in their 20s who have never been educated on how to be a Jew outside of the context of family life, but who may spend two decades outside of that context. Are there Jewish institutions and movements that can speak to that experience and provide Jewish pathways or a coherent sense of Jewish life during that span?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Young men are maturing later than their parents, with a  longer quasi adolescence going sometimes into their thirties; not so young women who generally are interested in settling in with a spouse (to be) by their mid twenties. I don’t know exactly why, it might be related to young men being more affected by the greater difficulty today in earning a decent living. The greater disparity yields the non-charedi version  of the shiduch crisis. I have an inventory of top quality young women priced to move, all across the country, with nary a bochur in sight. Young women are unable to fulfill their life plans because they can&#039;t find a great guy. A guy because he can&#039;t find a great job. 

There is a conflation in the article  of identity and selfhood. Identity is more superficial and determines where one is the Jewish spectrum, the degree of assimilation and whether we are willing to pop $2500 a year to join  a synagogue. Rabbis, teachers help with identity. As we all know, for many charedi rosh yeshivas  20-40-60-80-100 is the new 20. If they had their druthers we would never graduate from bais medresh. Rabbis are great for developing a very definite identity, but not particularly helpful when it comes to growing up, where it is a matter of having  a put-together self, one with  definite ambitions and goals, and a harmony of these ambitions with one&#039;s ideals and abilities.

I am not at all sure the lengthening of adolescence involves greater difficulty today of figuring out a coherent life plan. Quite the contrary. Compared to generations of bohemians, beatniks, hippies, and the class of ’68, young people today seem quite focused. I hold they want to move on but it doesn’t let itself; “es lust sich nisht” as we say in Yiddish, because of external structural problems.]]></description>
