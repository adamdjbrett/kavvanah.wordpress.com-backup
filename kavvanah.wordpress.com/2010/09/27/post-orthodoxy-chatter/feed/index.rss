					<description><![CDATA[&quot;There was/is a great deal of doubt and lack of faith in Modern Orthodoxy that has not been dealt with properly&quot;

Is this because lack of faith is usually put on autopilot, or because it&#039;s not even on one&#039;s radar?
The popularity of such books as &quot;Garden of Emunah&quot; (Lazer Brody) and Bilvavi Mishkan Evneh series (&quot;Building a Sanctuary in the Heart&quot;) are an indication of something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I take the quote to mean that he refers to everyone from 80 to 20. I think he opens up many other issues about what does it mean to believe, what is actually believed in private, and the change from a denomination to an ideology. Some of this has been discussed on Lookjed over the years.   
There was/is a great deal of doubt and lack of faith in Modern Orthodoxy that has not been dealt with properly. The recent concepts of orthoprax and &quot;does one need to believe anything?&quot; have derailed the discussion from legitimate discussions of faith and doubt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apropos of post-Orthodoxy, in a contribution to the most recent Meorot Journal, Gideon Rothstein claims that many in the Orthodox world who are pushing for a more egalitarian communal structure are not really Orthodox. I  wonder how the categories he mentioned correspond to your breakdown. Is he talking about those liberal rabbis who were in his YU semichha cohort c. 2000? Older Orthodox liberals who were around since the inception of JOFA? The cusp gen-xers like your guest? Is there something particular to the advent of post-orthodoxy in Rothstein&#039;s calling-out or is it similar to past controversies where it was strategic to question the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; of those involved?
Here is the relevant quote:

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,1394/&quot;&gt; In any conversation about where Orthodoxy should go, it seems obvious to me that all the contributors should have to be Orthodox. Of course, non-Orthodox people can have good ideas as well, but we look at those as outside ideas, to be considered more cautiously and accepted more gingerly, than when a fully Orthodox person offers the idea.
I raise that concern because I repeatedly have conversations with influential members of Jewish communities who reject basic premises of Orthodoxy. In private, I have spoken with various people of Jewish communal influence who admit that they do not really believe in God, or in prophecy, or in an Oral Law, or in any form of Divine Providence, or in the Exodus from Egypt.

It is not for me to judge them, nor do I know how God balances their beliefs against the great good they do for the Jewish community and the world; it is for me to know that their opinions on how Orthodoxy should move forward are, to some, inherently tainted, since they do not operate within the required parameters of an Orthodox life. And yet, on women‘s and other issues, such people are vehement and influential participants.

I use those examples of lack of faith because they are relatively indisputable; I know other prominent members of the conversation with whom I am uncomfortable for reasons that are less clear-cut. My opinion, again, is not important for its own sake, but for what it says about how we are conducting this conversation; if relatively left or center people are uncomfortable with the Orthodoxy of certain thinkers or lay people who are prominent members of the conversation, we have to consider how that affects the reaction to the ideas that come out of that conversation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something is indeed rotten in Denmark when we see surveys about observing half of Shabbos and other equally problematic types of behavior. There seems to be a lack of awareness in our communities that Shabbos is a day of renouncing our dominion, technological and otherwise,over this world, which educators, parents and students are unaware of, which has a rich halachic and hashkafic basis. A community educated and reared on observing Shabbos because &quot;we observe Shabbos in our family&quot; or the equivalent is truly and tragically at risk. 

Neil Harris-by the time you reached JSS in 1989, I suspect that the numbers of BTs were strongly outnumbered by FFBs , as opposed to the 1960s and 1970s, when anyone with a yeshiva high school education was admittted by R Besdin ZL on the proviso that he would be treated no differently than aBT as to his level of knowledge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/post-orthodoxy-chatter/#comment-1704&quot;&gt;Neil Harris&lt;/a&gt;.

Neil, I dont see it as authority or no authority but more as the question of what type of authority. There used to be a greater emphasis on the vital center-broad tent. There has been a shift from treating rabbis as part of a denomination  and a greater role for ideology and culture wars. On the other hand, a good gadol today has to have a media presence, or able to be used by his followers in the media. Successful gedolim can be downloaded. For some, there is a greater role of mystical charisma and magic today. There is also greater transparency required now. I am not sure of everything that led up to your post. People think in terms of management style today. Even when you identify gedolim today, there function has changed from authority to legitimation. And in some cases it is legitimation of popular mass reason.

The fourth turning is a pop version of what social-intellectual historians do. Jonathan Sarna&#039;s American Judaism contained a broad sweep of history and was written using similar categories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post.
&quot;He has the religious habits of the millenials but an animus against what he perceives as the closed-mindedness of the modern Orthodox Gen X’ers.&quot;
See this:
http://uberdox.blogspot.com/2006/05/why-we-dont-have-gadol-hador.html

Regarding JSU, I think that the prediction about the mechina program is probably right... will have to cater to them, as it did in the 70s/80s.  Even when I was in JSS (1989-1993) it was mostly those yeshiva high school grads when to either slack or because the were, what&#039;s now called, &quot;at-risk&quot;.  The average public school grad like myself wasn&#039;t really being serviced.

Regarding  Katy Perry, she is also almost on the cusp of Gen X/Y, being more Y, since she was bornin 1984.  Her views of religion seem to echo this.

BTW, Alan, are you a fan of The Fourth Turning by Strauss and Howe?

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to see a demographic and sociological survey of Gerim in Orthodox circles, who they were, who they are and how they&#039;re doing (Boomers, Xers, Yers), have they&#039;ve been doing, what influences decisions (many Xers from the internet, etc). There&#039;s been some discussion of them in several OTD blogs of recent. The same dynamics of change in community you discuss here as reflected in stam goyim becoming Jews would be interesting to see. I also think of R. Amselem&#039;s psak, and certain changes in &quot;transitional&quot; stages between goy in Jew (and Shmuel Kadosh&#039;s lectures at Mechon Hadar), based on changes in who&#039;s coming to convert (for example in Israel, those select russians who chose to convert often have Jewish fathers and having some &quot;in between&quot; status, etc), but I&#039;m sure there are other examples of changing margins betwixt and among.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;1950’s Orthodoxy” what is that?&lt;/em&gt;
I may have used it in a general sense for less about boundaries or checklists, just denominational affiliation.
&lt;em&gt;
if so, would you believe that the same percentages should show up in yeshivish&lt;/em&gt;, 
Not the same percentages but there are always changes also in those. I have my personal observations on shifts within those worlds. So, next time when someone from the Haredi world shows up in my living to talk, I can post. I do think that they are half a generation behind in the generational lines and we will have more changes to discuss in a decade.]]></description>

also. your comment &quot;Much of this is non-ideological, having more to do with carving out a space different than their parents.&quot; if so, would you believe that the same percentages should show up in yeshivish, black hat, hareidei and hasidic as in the modern orthodox or is the lack of going to the ivys etc diminish the numbers considerably? do you see this anecdotally? shouldn&#039;t all groups equally want to carve out space different from their parents according to your hypothesis?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did not mention the 1950&#039;s, since they are now quite elderly. I cannot define the 1960&#039;s and 1970&#039;s in a comment- at best it would be a description of a wide number of social, economic, religious, and institutional differences. 
 I am not sure that academic study of religion is playing a major role, just as I dont think that Katy Perry left the evangelical fold due to scholarship. And most of the Orthodox raised intellectuals that I meet are more frustrated by the lack of  Dara Horn and Don DelLillo.  I do think that the Centrist ideologues caught in the vortex of change are using scholarship as point to draw a line in  the sand for their own changing definitions. 
I always thought that the year in Israel was a projected space and was serving the emotional needs of the participants. It was not an indoctrination by outsiders. Now that they have different attitudes, they are projecting a different Israel.]]></description>
