<p><em>TOMÁŠ HALÍK worked as a psychotherapist during the Communist  regime in Czechoslovakia while at the same time was secretly ordained as  a Catholic priest and active in the underground church. Since the fall  of the regime, he has served as General Secretary to the Czech  Conference of Bishops and was an advisor to Václav Havel. He has  lectured at many universities throughout the world and is currently a  professor of philosophy and sociology at Charles University.</em> <a href="http://www.halik.cz/ja/english.php">A longer biography is available here. </a></p>
<p><a href="http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2010/09/tomas-halik-atheism-and-patience.html">A Protestant blog has a good immediate write up of his work</a>&#8211; Halik uses Nietzsche to accept the critiques of religion and builds from there without naivete about what can be proved from the natural order. &#8220;For all the debate about belief and nonbelief in today’s world—and how everyone becomes pigeonholed by one or the other— Tomáš Halík teaches that God requires us to persevere with our doubts, carry them in our hearts, and allow them to lead us to maturity. For Halík, patience is the main difference between faith and atheism.&#8221; The blog also has some thoughtful opinions contextualizing this work, for example he does not like Marylnne Robinson&#8217;s work that was discussed here. I have not read Halik yet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Halík is a Catholic thinker steeped in Nietzsche; he sees modernity&#8217;s criticism of Christianity as an indispensable resource, and as the context within which contemporary faith has to be articulated.</p>
<p>As you will have noticed, there is currently a whole industry of books responding to Dawkins and the new atheists – including some real gems (e.g. Terry Eagleton, David Bentley Hart), but also much that is merely boring and reactionary. I was stunned to discover that even Marilynne Robinson&#8217;s book, in spite of all the rave reviews (and in spite of my huge admiration for everything else she has written), was dull and uninspired. (Actually, it raises another question: why did Robinson feel the need to write this book, when her novel Gilead had already proved the existence of God?)</p>
<p>In contrast, I think Tomáš Halík has produced one of the best and most beautiful responses to the new atheism, in his recent book Patience with God (Doubleday 2009). His argument is that the real difference between faith and atheism is patience. Atheists are not wrong, only impatient. They want to resolve doubt instead of enduring it. Their insistence that the natural world doesn&#8217;t point to God (or to any necessary meaning) is correct. Their experience of God&#8217;s absence is a truthful experience, shared also by believers. Faith is not a denial of all this: it is a patient endurance of the ambiguity of the world and the experience of God&#8217;s absence. Faith is patience with God. Or as Adel Bestavros puts it (in the book&#8217;s epigraph): patience with others is love, patience with self is hope, patience with God is faith.</p>
<p>In contrast to the overblown rhetoric of so many Christian apologists – with their drastic naivety about the ambivalence of the natural world and the intractable difficulties of believing – Halík&#8217;s account strikes me as a sensitive and realistic articulation of the difference faith makes. The best thing about his book – again, in contrast to the usual apologetics – is that it&#8217;s actually a Christian response to atheism. Surely anything a Christian says to an atheist ought to arise not from an invincible commitment to being right, but from an understanding of the kindness of God, an awareness that there is room in God&#8217;s family even for those who doubt – those for whom the word &#8220;God&#8221; cannot easily be deciphered from the dark hieroglyphics of the world. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let me know if any good reviews appear in the next few days-weeks.<br />
<strong>If the answer to the lack of God in the 1950&#8217;s, was Heschel, Marcel, Tillich, Maritain and the continued influence of Buber, James, and Jung. There seems to be an emerging canon of 2010&#8217;s response to the current absence of God. Pretty soon someone will create an anthology of recent authors 21st century authors like the 1962 books called &#8220;Religious Existentialism.&#8221;</strong></p>

				<p>The gen-y millenials finally made it as a topic to an aging baby-boomer Jewish newspaper after being covered in the NYT the week before. The dividing lines for the 20somethings are not the baby-boomer issues but a new set of issues that are only appearing.</p>
<p>The new issues will be based on the sharp dividing line between those that marry young from those who will be single until their late 30&#8217;s. They will create two difference sets of life experience, different ways to frame their childhood, and different orthodoxies. If one is single until the late 30&#8217;s then the year in Israel has definitely worn off to be replaced by the rabbinical influences of their single life.  One spends a decade in the city with its dynamism of energy and new ideas. (But dont confuse urban life with academic town life.) One treats one&#8217;s community different if one is a member for 50 years or if one is only a member for 15 years to raise kids and one was mobile before and afterward.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960&#8217;s, there was an emphasis on outreach on the collegiate level becuase that was  seen as the formative moment, recently it has been on post- HS and on post-college. If one is floating in graduate school or urban jobs for many years then the need for outreach would need to shift to a later age. If life imitate the modeling shown them, then we are going to have a generation living the life shown in the TV show Friends.<strong>Which religious group will be able to reach them? Know that it wont be the same group that is reaching the early marriage and early settling down group. Which group will most likely be able to speak about emerging, forging, and contributing to the world?</strong></p>
<p><em>Emerging Adults: What to Do With 20-Somethings?<br />
Wednesday, September 1, 2010<br />
A recent New York Times Magazine cover story examined the plight of the indecisive and paralyzed 20-somethings who are living in a newly coined life stage called “emerging adulthood.” It is a critical developmental period.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Robin Marantz Henig – NY Times Magazine<br />
33 is the New 13<br />
The Jewish world is organized as if only a narrow stream separates childhood and adulthood, but that stream has become a river. We need to build a bridge — an entirely new infrastructure — over the new river of emerging adulthood. Imagine if 33 became the new 13 and we invested heavily in Jewish young people all the way to actual adulthood. The bridge would be built around the fundamental understanding that the investment is largely uni-directional (as it is with children): we can’t expect emerging adults to make solid Jewish commitments during a developmental stage that is defined by non-commitment.<br />
There is good news: most Jewish emerging adults go to college, so we know exactly where to find them to start the process after they leave home. And they are pluripotent: they are as open to Jewish experiences as they are to everything else.<br />
Daniel Libenson is the executive director of the University of Chicago Hillel and a 2009 Avi Chai Fellow, <a href="http://www.uchicagohillel.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.uchicagohillel.org</a><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Personal Discovery and Development<br />
While the reality on the ground is complex, in the end the broad message is simple: It’s about authentic, personal experiences; being with friends and experiencing (or creating) community together; and opportunities that deepen Jewish knowledge and stimulate Jewish growth.<br />
But in its simplicity is a profound message: Identity formation is ultimately a result of personal discovery and development that, outside the family, happens in a circle of friends.<br />
Morlie Levin, CEO Birthright Israel NEXT, next.birthrightisrael.com</em></p>
<p><em><br />
Great Conversation<br />
To be 20-something is to search for one’s place in the world. Between career and education, friendship and romances, young people do not so much drift as struggle with profound questions of meaning: Who am I? What can I contribute to the world? What is a good life to live? The Jewish community can offer emerging adults not a set of answers, but a forum in which to forge a sense of meaning.<br />
Our message to young Jews should be: Your concerns are the right ones. We have been wrestling with these questions for quite some time. Come and listen to some of our responses, and then join the conversation.<br />

				<p>I was asked by an Jewish educator- principal if I know what it means when current HS kids ask each other if they keep &#8220;half shabbos&#8221; or &#8220;full shabbos?&#8221;<br />
Since I know the lay of the land, I said sure it is texting.<br />
He said: Your right. The kids call someone who texts (and tweets and posts) on Shabbos as keeping half-shabbos and those who dont full shabbos.<br />
This phenomena is more widespread than just the average modern orthodox. I have seen rabbinic kids here who wear black hats admit that they text on shabbos.<br />
The educator said that the kids consider it part of daily verbal communication.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/about-us/staff/alon-goshen-gottstein-executive-director.html">Rabbi Dr. Alon Goshen-Gottstein</a> runs an interfaith Institute in Jerusalem, which mainly holds international conferences of the world&#8217;s religious leaders, bringing together world leaders who generally do not get a chance to meet. He successfully brings important teachers of the dharma together to meet western religious leaders. He also holds a variety of academic meetings.</p>
<p>Alon Goshen-Gottstein&#8217;s institute issued a public statement last week against Jewish views that rob non-Jews of their dignity and right to life inherent in their Image of God. It was precipitated by the controversy around Rabbi Yitzhak Shapira&#8217;s book which suggested the killing of children. For a summary of the rabbis who supported Shapira &#8211; <a href="http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1185224.html">see here in Hebrew.</a> <a href="http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/uploads/media/Appeal_to_the_Supreme_Court.pdf">Here is the petition to the Israeli Supreme court </a>asking the court to censure Yitzhak Shapira. There were good op-eds in YNET that, as far as I know, did not get translated for the English edition. I was waiting for the translations. <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3939325,00.html">One is by Rav Yoel Bin-Nun</a> on how this new trend in the Religious Zionist world is against the approach of Rav Kook, and Rav Kook did not think the laws of war apply today. The<a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3939859,00.html"> other was by Rav Benny Lau who </a> castigates the rabbis supporting the work, how Rav Amital taught him that this racism is the wrong approach, and that one cannot claim academic freedom for a beit midrash.<br />
For some of the historical background of these changes from an outsider perspective, see Firestone, Reuven, &#8220;Holy War in Modern Judaism? &#8220;Mitzvah War&#8221; and the Problem of the &#8220;Three Vows&#8221; Journal of the American Academy of Religion &#8211; Volume 74, Number 4, December 2006, pp. 954-982</p>
<p>Now, Alon Goshen-Gottstein has moved his educational institute into a public role and condemned the racism and hatred of gentiles.</p>

Statement of Scholars of the Jewish Theology Project of the Elijah Interfaith Institute</strong></p>
<p>Recent weeks and months have brought to public attention the issue of Jewish attitudes to non-Jews, as these are found in some traditional sources and halakhah (Jewish religious law), particularly with reference to Rabbi Yitzchak Shapira’s book Torat Hamelekh. The great liberty with which the author dispenses with the life of non-Jews under various circumstances has become a scandal in the media, a subject for police investigation for incitement, a discussion item on antisemitic websites, and the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Israel. It has engendered heated discussion, most of which has focused on the right to teach Torah and to engage in discussion of halakhah, especially of a theoretical nature, unencumbered by external considerations and factors, such as police and state control. While these issues may be legitimate subjects for discussion, they conceal the main concerns raised by these teachings and their public reception. Many Rabbinical authorities have subsequently failed to condemn these teachings in theoretical and practical terms, leaving the impression that these are indeed appropriate contemporary Jewish attitudes to non-Jews. </p>
<p>For this reason, we, rabbis, teachers and scholars of Jewish studies of various disciplines, religious denominations and political perspectives, from different countries worldwide, have come together to express with a united voice our deep disdain for these extremist teachings, which are opposed to fundamental Jewish conceptions of the unity of humanity which all Jews affirm at this time of year on the High Holidays. We assert that the core issue they raise must be given priority in Jewish education and thought. Our view is that Jewish teaching involves more than merely citing texts, whether in or out of context. Teaching and the art of halakhic ruling always reflect a broader religious worldview, guided by core values. In our understanding, the creation of humanity in God’s image is the great principle, as our sages recognized.[1] We believe this mandates full respect for the infinite value, equality and uniqueness of every human life, for it is created in the image of God. Our Torah’s ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace.[2] These and other great principles are the guidelines through which we interpret and teach our tradition.[3] </p>
<p>We are working together under the aegis of the Elijah Interfaith Institute, to bring to light teachings of Judaism that cohere to this worldview. Love of one&#8217;s own group should not be equated with the hatred of others. Israel&#8217;s calling is harmonious with the wellbeing of all humanity. We recognize that there are voices in our tradition that have lost sight of thise great principles, because of the unspeakable suffering that our people have undergone throughout history. It is, therefore, a contemporary educational and halakhic challenge to confront these extremist teachings, to contain them, and to dissent from them publicly, applying the methods of halakhah, classical interpretation and historical study. </p>
<p>We have been collaborating on a project of developing a contemporary Jewish approach to other religions, that would make our students and communities aware of the dangers inherent in such extremist views in our tradition, and that would inspire a broader view of Judaism, its ethical task and its vision for humanity. </p>
<p>Accordingly, we call upon rabbis and educators to take a clear stand against narrow views Jewish particularity, in favor of a broader vision of Judaism&#8217;s relations to the other. Our scholars stand ready to debate the views under discussion. Our own critique of Torat Hamelekh will shortly be published on this website. We will also be publishing educational resources that provide an alternative view of the non-Jew in Judaism, that remind us that &#8220;The Lord is good to all, and His compassion extends to all His creatures.&#8221;[4]<br />
________________________________________<br />
[1]See Sifra Qedoshim 4; Mishnah Avot 3:14.<br />
[2]Proverbs 3:17.<br />
[3] We are painfully aware that such problematic theoretical teachings can easily become transformed into practical guidelines for action, as witnessed by horrifying acts such as the Hebron massacre by Goldstein in 1994. We also recall some tragic lessons of our history, and the actions of Israel’s enemies in the past century, applying a perverted logic that we should not replicate within Jewish teaching. For example, the right to kill children lest they grow up to threaten us was cited by Otto Ohlendorf of the German Army Einsatzgruppe C at his trial, to justify his unit&#8217;s shooting of tens or hundreds of thousands of Jewish children among the more than million Jews murdered by the shooting squads in Eastern Europe in 1941-1942.<br />
[4] Psalm 145:9. </p>

				<p>Over a Rosh Hashanah dinner, a local community leader and CFO was complaining about day school tuition. (His kids are finishing day school) He asked why the community did not see the need for transparency, accountability, and the creation of endowments back in the 1990’s. As a CFO, he knows that one is always weighing cost benefits of outsourcing, joint purchasing, and cut backs. And he mentioned that like most non-profits, they only survive with endowments. What was the community thinking?</p>
<p>Here is a talk that was published today by Archbishop Dolan of NYC. It was published with several responses.  It may provide some of you with some thoughts or at least quotes for speeches. Dolan points out the decline and current challenges especially the rising cost of salaries and he suggests to go back to the diocesan responsibility and in the Jewish case it would be back to the kehilalh system. (Parenthetically, I must point out that in Europe the members of the vaad arba Artzot, kehilah leadrs, parnesim and heads of school board were businessmen not rabbis.) Dolan points out the need to move beyond petty turf wars.</p>
<p>Maurince Halliman points out that parochial schools may no longer be better that public schools. We are not recent immigrants anymore in poor school districts and the results just give us a Lake Wobegon “slightly above average.” There may be a need for proper assessment of strengths and weaknesses? Know what your product is. How does it compare to the Tenafly school system?</p>
<p>Robert Sullivan points out that commitment is based on a still unquantified continuity of the parents attitudes. And that more creative working with public schools or creating day schools with a greater emphasis on secular studies may help the schools. (Several of the local Islamic schools are going that route. Lets not forget that Hirsch’s school system only had 2 periods of Jewish studies a day and Maimonides School originally had equal time for Latin and Talmud, one period a day.) And  Patrick J. McCloskey leaves us with the exhortation to remember that there is “An abundance of brilliant leadership and expertise is available among top professionals, academics, CEOs, CFOs and so on in dioceses across the country.”</p>
<p><em>The Catholic Schools We Need<br />
Archbishop Timothy Dolan<br />
SEPTEMBER 13, 2010<br />
But what of today’s Catholic schools that exist in a world largely free of those sorts of 20th-century threats? Are we not facing our own crisis of closure for the Catholic school in America?<br />
The answer is yes. Statistics from the National Catholic Educational Association tell a sobering tale about Catholic schools in the United States. From a student enrollment in the mid-1960s of more than 5.2 million in nearly 13,000 elementary and secondary Catholic schools across America, there are now only half as many, with just 7,000 schools and 2.1 million students enrolled.<br />
The most crippling reason, however, may rest in an enormous shift in the thinking of many American Catholics, namely, that the responsibility for Catholic schools belongs only to the parents of the students who attend them, not to the entire church. Nowadays, Catholics often see a Catholic education as a consumer product, reserved to those who can afford it. The result is predictable: Catholics as a whole in the United States have for some time disowned their school system, excusing themselves as individuals, parishes or dioceses from any further involvement with a Catholic school simply because their own children are not enrolled there, or their parish does not have its own school.<br />
The truth is that the entire parish, the whole diocese and the universal church benefit from Catholic schools in ways that keep communities strong. So all Catholics have a duty to support them. Reawakening a sense of common ownership of Catholic schools may be the biggest challenge the church faces in any revitalization effort ahead. Thus, we Catholics need to ask ourselves a risky question: Who needs Catholic schools, anyway?<br />
To re-grow the Catholic school system, today’s efforts need to be rooted in the long-term financial security that comes from institutional commitment through endowments, foundations and stable funding sources and also from every parish supporting a Catholic school, even if it is not “their own.” Catholic education is a communal, ecclesial duty, not just for parents of schoolchildren or for parishes blessed to have their own school. Surely American Catholics have sufficient wealth and imagination to accomplish this.<br />
We cannot succumb to the petty turf wars that pit Catholic schools against religious education programs and other parish ministries. Pope Benedict XVI reminds us that the church is all about both/and, not either/or. Strong Catholic schools strengthen all other programs of evangelization, service, catechesis and sanctification. The entire church suffers when Catholic schools disappear.</em></p>
<p><em>Maureen T. Hallinan<br />
In a society characterized by an intense interest in student achievement, many Catholics feel secure in the longstanding reputation of Catholic schools as providing an outstanding education. This positive reputation has been referred to as the “Catholic school advantage.” It is based on empirical evidence that throughout the second half of the twentieth century, Catholic secondary school students attained higher standardized test scores in reading and mathematics than public high school students. </em></p>
<p><em>Yet these findings are dated and may no longer accurately describe the academic benefits of Catholic schools. Recently, the federal government has taken aggressive steps to improve public school achievement&#8230;In light of these changes, it is important to determine whether Catholic school students still outpace public school students in terms of achievement and other student outcomes. </em></p>
<p><em>An analysis of nationally representative, longitudinal surveys allows for an evaluation of contemporary schools. A few studies indicate that at least at the high school level, students in today’s Catholic high schools, on average, still outpace those in public high schools. More research is needed to determine whether this is a stable pattern and whether it extends to earlier grades. A recent analysis of seventh and eighth grade students in middle or elementary schools in a large urban environment failed to find a Catholic school achievement advantage in reading and mathematics for the average student; but it did show evidence of a benefit for disadvantaged and minority students in these grades. Another study reports that children who attended kindergarten and early elementary grades at Catholic schools received slightly higher, though barely statistically significant, test scores than those in public schools. These findings provide evidence that while Catholic schools may not provide a strong academic advantage for K-8 students, it does benefit certain subsets of students, namely, those in most need of academic support to succeed in school. </em></p>
<p><em>Beyond Religious Education- Robert Sullivan<br />
‘We need not think that our church will exist only if we push children through religious schools.’</em></p>
<p><em>What if, moreover, these schools deemphasized religious education? In so doing, the school itself—educating young people to be thinking, interested citizens, conversant in the arts and history, in addition to perhaps theology and philosophy—would be an act of social justice, and, as well, a continuation of the American church’s historic role as host to immigrant communities, especially in cities, but also in suburbs where immigrant populations have increased greatly over the past decade. There is historical precedent: in Reformation Spain, Jesuit schools exempted Protestant students from religious studies. Rather than act as evangelizing mechanism, schools might operate more on the model of Catholic hospitals, or even Catholic colleges, which accept and encourage the presence of a variety of religious beliefs, not to mention non-believers.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, I recognize that some studies have shown that Catholic schools can be an effective means of passing on the faith. But I remain skeptical of the idea that young people who attend Catholic schools are more likely to attend Mass later on. In my own experience, the most important indicator as to whether or not the young person will or will not attend Mass is unmeasurable and mysterious and has mostly to do with the parent. (If you could plot it would have the parent’s own relationship with his faith on one axis and his or her relationship with their children on the other.) </em></p>
<p><em>Patrick J. McCloskey<br />
Undoubtedly there are adequate intellectual, managerial and financial resources in the Catholic community to meet current and future challenges. An abundance of brilliant leadership and expertise is available among top professionals, academics, CEOs, CFOs and so on in dioceses across the country. </em></p>
<p><em>Also crucial is effective leadership from the hierarchy, as Archbishop Dolan demonstrates. The fierce passion, which characterized prelates and religious orders from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, needs to be recovered where lacking throughout the Catholic community.</em></p>

				<p>This blog is one year old. The three month and six month markers were harder than this one. At this point, the practice of blogging is part of my routine. I started on September 10, 2009. Originally, the readership was limited to students and facebook friends. In mid December, the blog was discovered by several other blogs especially the posts comparing &#8220;Catholic Schools and Jewish Day Schools” “Post-Orthodoxy” “The Lubavitcher Rebbe on Transcendental Meditation.” On February 8th and then 25th  the blizzard forced homebound East Coaster to look for something to do and they spent their time on blogs and my blog went viral.  Popular springtime  posts included the Art Green review, the Marryanne Robinson cycle, Rabbi Morgenstern and Meditation, and New writing of Rabbi Kook&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the posts of the first three months that did not get the attention they deserve include:<br />
<a href="../../../../2009/09/13/first-jewish-reference-to-the-dalai-lama/index.html">The first Jewish reference to the Dalai Lama </a><br />
<a href="../../../../2009/09/23/levinas-and-nostra-aetate/index.html">Levinas’s Jewish Response to Nostra Aetate</a><br />
<a href="../../../../2009/10/19/determine-your-rabbinical-age/index.html">Determine Your Rabbinical Age </a><br />
<a href="../../../../2009/12/14/modern-orthodoxy-modern-meant-moral-self-transformation/index.html">Modern Orthodoxy- Modern meant Moral Self-transformation</a></p>
<p>I did a Tishrei cycle that was read but is timely to repost. The posts focused on the 9th to the  12th centuries of <a href="../../../../2009/09/15/unetaneh-tokef-who-wrote-it/index.html">Unetaneh Tokef;</a> <a href="../../../../2009/09/16/pesikta-derav-kahana/index.html">Pesikta derav Kahana;</a> <a href="../../../../2009/09/29/avodah-priests-angels-and-bestiaries/index.html">Avodat Yom Hakippurim;</a> and <a href="../../../../2009/10/07/kallir-for-shmini-atzeret-the-rabbinic-view-of-rain/index.html">Geshem on shimini atzeret.</a></p>
<p>My post of this summer on <a href="../../../08/09/rav-kook-on-religion-and-other-religions-from-the-new-book/index.html">&#8220;Rav Kook and Other Religions and Revelation&#8221;</a> should have gotten readers but it received no hits.</p>
<p>I am willing to take suggestions for WordPress improvements-widgets to install or plugins. WordPress changed my theme without asking and erased all widgets this past summer and then reinstalled them a few days after a fashion. So there are some kinks from the summer.</p>
<p>My book “Judaism and Other Religions” came out in March. Despite the list price, the price on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble fluctuates weekly between 57-73 dollars. Right now, both Amazon and B &amp; N have it for 57. If you come to my house, then I can give it to you for 47.(No mail or shipping possible). It will jump back to 63, 68, or 73 in a week or two. I don’t have a date for the paperback but expect it around Dec 2011. I am told via the grapevine that the first academic review of my book is scheduled for November. The latest PR for the Book was in the <em>Bergen County Jewish Standard</em> last week.</p>
<blockquote><p>Teaneck resident Alan Brill’s new book, “Judaism and Other Religions: Models of Understanding” (Palgrave MacMillan), is a sort of post-tolerance manifesto for a post 9/11 world. The humanistic approach to tolerance in today’s Western world treats “the other” as secular without requiring any understanding of the other’s religion, argues Brill&#8230;<br />
Jews involved in interfaith dialogue since the 1970s have mostly come from the 1960s “universal, we’re-all-one perspective” that emphasized openness over exclusivism, says Brill. He felt that today’s realities called for a look at how classical Jewish sources could bring an old/new dimension to the discussion.</p>
<p><a href="http://http/www.jstandard.com/index.php/content/item/14708/">Read Entire Review Here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>My next book Judaism and World Religions: Encountering Christianity, Islam, and Eastern Traditions [Hardcover] is already listed on Barnes and Noble for next March 2011. I have several semi-completed manuscripts for 2-3 more books to be pursued as soon as I am dome with the one on World Religions. So, I will likely be blogging for at least a few more years while I edit, edit, edit.</p>
<p>Blogging takes time and I try not to let it interfere with other projects. However, I take copious notes on books and articles that I read for work so I actually write more posts that get posted because it takes time to edit them for the blog. Once again, I welcome guest posts that fit into this blog. I also wish to remind people that I do not post comments that are Google searches  of quotes, which add nothing to the blog and only show off google skills. If you link one of my posts here to Twitter &amp; Facebook, let me know so I know where the traffic is coming from. </p>
<p>I wish everyone a Gemar Tov and Gut Gebentched Yohr</p>

				<p>I know that I have people who sit on the boards of Jewish day schools among my readership. You liked my post comparing Catholic schools to Day Schools. Well, here is a model to take note of. Business Leadership Organized for Catholic Schools (BLOCS) is moving from creating scholarship funds to creating endowments for 7 Philadelphia Catholic Schools. They have put the businessmen and CEO’s in charge. Maybe you can give them a call and brainstorm together? From the list of donors, it seems they are going for corporate gifts from major national companies and from law firms.</p>
<blockquote><p>A business group has pledged $4 million in matching grants to help seven urban Catholic schools create endowments during the 2010-11 academic year.<br />
Business Leadership Organized for Catholic Schools (BLOCS) on Thursday announced that it had signed partnership agreements with the schools as it launches its urban endowment initiative.<br />
The pilot program advances an approach to helping financially strapped urban parish schools that BLOCS officials have been discussing for the last few years.<br />
Five of the schools are in Philadelphia, and one each is in Chester and Lansdowne.<br />
Joe Garecht, BLOCS executive director, said in the past that the organization&#8217;s primary focus was on raising scholarship funds to help low-income students attend Catholic schools. He said the organization decided to broaden its scope to include helping to save Catholic schools, because so many were closing.<br />
&#8220;Schools continue to close in places where they are needed most,&#8221; he said.<br />
In the last decade, the city has lost 30 percent of its Catholic elementary schools and enrollment has dropped by 41 percent.<br />
Under the initiative, each of the seven schools will raise money and BLOCS grants will match each dollar. The money will be deposited in individual endowment accounts managed by BLOCS that will help cover schools&#8217; operating costs.<br />
The schools&#8217; principals and pastors have agreed to work with BLOCS for the next two years, Garecht said.<br />
The ultimate goal, he said, is for each school to have a $7 million endowment in three years.<br />

<p>You can make the calls Tuesday. Have your secretaries arrange meeting for after holiday season. <a href="http://www.blocs.org/board.shtml">Here is the board of directors.</a> <a href="http://www.blocs.org/donors.shtml">And here are the donors.</a> Notice the broad base of the donors. </p>
