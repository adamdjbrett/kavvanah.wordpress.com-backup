					<description><![CDATA[I was puzzled by Dr Brill&#039;s pitting of Reb Zadok over Reb Nachman.
For me the shnei kohanim hagedolim (Reb Zadok as well as Rav Kook) brought me to Reb Nachman. He was wont to tell his chassidim I want you to be a Litvak in learning and  hassid in the heart (true attribution?). However he defies the usual taxonomy of hassidish vs litvish no?
I too have difficulty with the appropriation of Breslov by both charismatic baalei teshuva who do not see the context of his writings in the history of Jewish intellectual thought (be it kabbalistic or otherwise)  as well as the mea shearim kanaaim who have sanitized breslov with the veneer of haredi lifestyle and praxis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/08/21/zvi-mark-%e2%80%93-the-religious-thought-of-rabbi-nachman-of-breslov-part-2-of-3/#comment-1511&quot;&gt;Alan Brill&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr. Brill -
Thanks for the reply.  I love and value the blog and I enjoyed your Kabbalah class at Revel.  I&#039;ve become a bit attracted to Breslov in recent years.  Perhaps the older I get, the more I realize the limits of intellectualism.  As moderns, we can explore and explain the most complex scientific and technological systems, but we always reach a wall that perhaps only radical and passionate faith can surmount.   Maybe.  It&#039;s funny, I wouldn&#039;t have pegged you as a Maimonidean Litvak given your expertise in mysticism (although you are certainly an incomperable academic and I really value and appreciate your work)!  Your post inspired me to purchase Zvi Mark&#039;s book.  
Thanks and best regards,
Josh]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rebbi Nachman is not the same category as post modern rebellion against morality and values. But where does he fit? 
 His attraction is based on many things but he did discover the depths of the soul. (The zimzum he places in the human soul.) He tends to answer large questions in a simple manner. Troubling arguments between great people? --no problem. He says a whole lesson on that.  Sexual anxiety? He gives help for that.  Rabbis that learn Torah but are evil? No problem. He explains that.
But he does not place service of God on unquestionable doctrines but on personal service.
But the difficulty in understanding him is that he does come in a context. Talmud, the Arizal, the Besht.
Trying to understand him without the proper background is the source of misunderstanding and of the abuse of Rebbi Nachman by the present day rabbis of breslov that tend to think they are themselves Rebbi Nachman, the messiah and God all rolled into one. They seem to be trying to hitch a ride off of rebbi nachman. They can’t be charismatic `enough to get their own following so they use him as bait for the unsuspecting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rebbe Nachman is for the post-modern era in the same way that (l&#039;havdil) Dogen (the 13th century founder of the Soto school of Zen Buddhism) is for the post-modern era.  One can ignore their Orthodoxies and pick &#038; choose their cool stuff, like casting off the intellect to reach God.

&quot;Casting off the intellect&quot; is very post-modern.]]></description>
