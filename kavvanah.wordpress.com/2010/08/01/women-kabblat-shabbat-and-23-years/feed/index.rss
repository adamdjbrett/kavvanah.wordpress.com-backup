					<description><![CDATA[Alan, as you know, I was part of this group, was on the phone with Wolowelsky, Adler, and Berkovitz when the calls were made to them, and was one of the sources for this entry. There is one observation which needs to be added about why the chavurah did not continue. It is true of course that any such group consisting mainly of students is likely to be transitory in nature. Some of us were concerned about pressure from YU on those who took part, though as far as I am aware that never came to pass. What ended the group, in any case, wasn&#039;t just a &quot;slouch into centrism&quot; however that might be defined. It would be more accurate to say that those who wanted to create a new path within Orthodoxy were put off by those who wanted to take the group on a trajectory away from both cultural and halachic identification as an Orthodox chavurah -some of the founders declared at a certain point that it would be moving in the direction of complete egalitarianism, which is how I came to be both one of the first to join and one of the first to leave. I can&#039;t speak for anyone but myself as to why they stopped attending, but I can say that it started to peter out not long after. So there is backing in this whole tale both for those who want to point to it as the beginning of change within Orthodoxy (the recounting of the views of Adler, Wolowelsky and Berkovitz is correct) and for those who who would want to sound a note of warning about slippery slopes, or at least underline the thought that in some ways Orthodoxy can only be nudged in a more liberal direction from within.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As an outsider like AS, i believe that there more effort and energy among feminist in favor of women&#039;s education rather that greater roles in a synagogue. 

Also, I believe that many felt more comfortable (or less uncomfortable) with women&#039;s tefillah groups than women leading Kabbalat Shabbat. Many of the subsequent battles were waged there.

It&#039;s also possible that as Orthodoxy moved rightward in the nineties, the Orthodox left struggled to just hold ground.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps the implications of having a women lead Kabbalat Shabbat  are different today since it is more associated with post orthdoxy ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The momentum petered out in part (in my reading of a history that I was mostly absent from) because centrist Orthodoxy moved almost immediately to an embrace of the post-feminist anti-radical,  acceptance of de jure social equality and could thereby move on without dealing with the critique of patriarchal power. 

I also wonder whether the Conservative fissure over ordaining women a few years earlier reverberated through liberal Orthodoxy.]]></description>
