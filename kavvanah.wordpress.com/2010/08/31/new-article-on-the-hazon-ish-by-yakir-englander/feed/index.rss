					<description><![CDATA[Alan: I have now read Englander&#039;s [E.] article.  As the saying goes,  now I am first angry.

E. cites my article exactly once. He writes at the beginning of his article that  scholarship on the HI treats his differences  with  the mussar  movement  and the  method of Talmud study in the Yeshivot  as matters of emphasis in the service of God  and not much beyond that. In the note he refers to Brown&#039;s thesis and my article.

This is simply not true.  In my article I pointed to the deep differences  differences between the HI and both movements, stemming  from their different anthropologies. . 

Morover, E. presents as one of his main  hiddushim the idea that Hi&#039;s critique  of both movements stemmed from the same root, namely both movement&#039;s  focus on the self.    This is the EXACT point I made  --it is indeed my article&#039;s MAIN point--and E. doesn&#039;t acknowledge it.

There are  also many other points of similarity between my article and E.&#039;s  unacknowledge by him, but this should suffice for the nonce. 

To  be sure there are slight differnces of emphasis  between my article and E.&#039;s which are worthy of discussion.  But his neglect and misrepresentation of my article and  his unjustified  claims of novelty  are inexcusable. They are also in violation of all academic ethics.

BTW, Alan, E. does refer to autonomy, when he speaks  of the analytic school viewing the student of the text of the  talmud  as a &quot;subyect atzmai.&quot;
 
Alan, when you have the time, read my article and E.&#039;s back to back and get back to us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan: I refer you to my first quote: &quot;The HI was suspicious of focus on the SELF&quot;

In my article I spoke of the importance of the HI of overcoming the evil inclination, ,i.e. one&#039;s natural inclinations,  through submission to the halakhah.  True, I did not  speak about the body.  I am  not sure where the HI does.

In sum,  perhaps I  should  have  not said that Englander&#039;s article  contains nothing new.  But it still  seems to be  variant of mine, pushing my argument a bit further.]]></description>

Larry, with all due respect, I found it something new. Your issues of autonomy-modernity are not body, self, and negation. His discussion of human nature was insightful. Even though I am in the middle of working and will hopefully get to respond to EJ by yom tov, your discussion does not open up to ej&#039;s points in the same way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to make a few points regarding the substance of the CI views. 1) The CI can be perfectly right about Musar and Brisk, but for the wrong reason. His conclusions on these topics do not entail any of his views about human nature. There might be any one of a number of reasons why somebody would be opposed to Musar and Lumdus. 2) He seems to reify the two “Yetzers” as if they were a thing, something like a fortress or walled city which is to be conquered by force and destroyed. He doesn’t question these metaphors. The alternative is to view them as dispositions or attractions, tendencies and such. 3) The CI doesn’t worry at all that his own views are being driven by the yetzer hara. He allows that a person might deceive himself, thinking he is acting out of good motives, when in fact he is not. But he doesn’t seem to have a clear idea of an unconscious and certainly not a dynamic unconscious. 4) He doesn’t differentiate between self and drives, impulses, etc. So destroying a certain impulse for him is destroying a self. 5) The CI knows of no way other than a sadistic negation of an impulse forever. In reality when applied let’s say to dieting, this method fails more often than not. It now seems if you told somebody you can eat and enjoy as much as you want, but no white(bread, pasta, potatoes) you get much better results. I imagine such a method would be unacceptable, because it is not sufficiently ascetic.

There’s a lot more to be said, but I think this is a start.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan:  I haven&#039;t  checked your blog for a while, which is why  I am only commenting now. My thoughts, since you asked for them, is that  I SAID ALL OF THIS ALREADY  in my article on &quot;The Hazon Ish: Haredi Critic of Traditional Orthodoxy.&quot;   I quote:
 
&quot;The HI was suspicious of the focus on the self, even if the focus was for religious purposes. &quot;

Again: &quot;In sum we are arguing that the HI&#039;s  criticism of both the analytic  school of talmudic scholarship and mussar ideology stem from the same source.  The proponents of both tacitly conceded too much to modernity by allowing too great a role for human autonomy.&quot;

There is much more in the same vein.

Moreover, I contrasted  the HI&#039;s emphasis on submission  with  Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s emphasis on human autonomy. I discus Navarodeck as well, and begin  with Chaim Grade.  So,  in addition to anticipating pretty much everything Englander says,  my article  addressed your question and comment  as well.

I cannot download Englander&#039;s article right now?  Does he cite me? Benny Brown refers to my article and discusses it in his thesis, so I cannot imagine Englander  is unaware of it.

In any event,  if your precis of the article is correct, it seems to me that Englander has basically reinvented the wheel, MY WHEEL.

As you may guess, I am very upset. Didn&#039;t anyone  read my article? Didn&#039;t you?

Please respond.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;On one hand it is the same submission and rejection of autonomy, values outside the halakhah, and distrust of the intellect. Yet, in Centrism one gets to live a life of the body, personal choice, emotions, and imagination so long as one does not apply it to Torah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Centrist Orthodoxy definitely includes voices (and they may even be in the majority) that assume an ethic independent of halakhah. Opinions may differ as to whether that ethic is at all different from Halakhah, but clearly, many Centrist authors assume that a person&#039;s innate sense of justice is a source of valid and even desirable information and emotions. Also, the Rov&#039;s existentialism clearly considers innate emotions important, otherwise, why care about dialectic, catharsis, Adam I and II coming to live harmoniously in the full person (who is both religious and technological at once)?]]></description>

One can make the same case for people who study Gemara all day.  There are plenty of Talmidim Chachamim who can parse words with the best of them but who act without kindness or consideration towards others.  I would view Musar historically as one of the first efforts towards psychoanalysis.  Like Freud a lot of it was stumbling in the dark trying to deal with psychology without much of an empirical basis.  That said, even a rudimentary approach to psychology can work for some people.  I suggest you read up on AA and other 12 step programs, which seem to work with a certain subset of the population although nobody quite knows precisely why.  My sense is that Salanter, and Ziv and Hurwitz were experimentalists who learned through trial and error how to work on themselves and then attempted to apply that knowledge to others.  I would guess that they would be effective with personalities that were similar to their own.  If Mussar had been able to mature on its own it may well have split into many different approaches mirroring psychological approaches.  Perhaps Zvi Finkel&#039;s approach would have evolved into a Martin Seligman type of Positive Pscyhology for example.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some thoughts:

1. You seem to say at the end that according to Centrist Orthodoxy, the Torah is indifferent to secular life. I think it is more accurate to say that CO sees positive value in secular life.

2. Isn&#039;t &quot;submission and rejection of autonomy&quot; common to pretty much any conception of Orthodox Judaism? I think mussar advocates would be surprise to hear that such a description does not apply to them.

3. You equate the &quot;self&quot; with the &quot;evil inclination&quot; and thus argue that according to the Chazon Ish there is no difference between the ideals of the mussar movement and what they claim to oppose. This conception seems to me rather out of touch with how religion is in fact experience by pretty much anyone including the CI, but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s an argument against you or against the CI. Anyway, if we accept this logic, then CO indeed abandons large sectors of life to the yetzer hara. But CO individuals are often interested in mussar, and institutionally, CO tolerates a certain level of halachic as well as psychological deviation. It is not clear that CO is any closer to the CI than to the mussar paradigm, as they are presented here.

4. Personally, I am not sure the CI&#039;s writings have the philosophical awareness and consistency that are needed for the kind of analysis  in this post. What I recall from reading him is that very &quot;non-CI&quot; ideas are also present and used as necessary, which would make this post an &quot;achronish&quot; attempt to isolate concepts that the original author never intended  to or conceived of isolating.]]></description>
