					<description><![CDATA[i think this is resultant of the socio-economic-political position centrist orthodoxy (and I suspect evangelism, though I don&#039;t know enough to say) wishes to place itself.  if the ethos of centrist orthodoxy is (and i think it is) that one can live a comfortable and respectable life and &quot;still&quot; be orthodox, the religious question is secondary to the socio-economic-political one.  god, as it were, worships middle class-edness.  In this sense, god&#039;s presence in the kitchen is not so much that he is there to be worshipped as a household diety, however sad that itself might be, but, worse, to worship the household.  

but to change this would be either to move towards the right religiously or the left politically, neither of which most centrist orthodox are interested in doing.]]></description>
