					<description><![CDATA[EJ-
It seems you like Shilo&#039;s approach. Any thoughts on it?

&lt;em&gt;A basic feature of secular thought and life is that the language keep on morphing, new ideas, new ways with one language replacing the other at a rapid pace.&lt;/em&gt;

I think that you have hit on an important point- rabbis may need new language every generation or two in order to reach people, but humanities,thought, and culture are ever changing. This seems like a basic sociology of religion division. When a 13th century Talmudic commentary is a Maimonidean it is not the same as a translator-commentator Maimonidean. The former creates a single new language by reading a few books, while the latter is involved in an ever changing discourse. Mid-twentieth century american rabbis picked up freud, existentialism, and Kant as a fixed small shelf of books, but that is not the same as the ever changing world of thought.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think his position would be stronger if he adopted Elchanan Shilo’s  idea that the religious community can consist of a wide range of observances and not only a wide range of  haskafot. The rabbi should be observant , and the kehila has the traditional ways of Judaism as the base line and center, but any Orthodox kehila, certainly in Israel  should be accepting  of all those who want to participate. 

I am also not clear if he thinks of his midway position as adopting the platform of the settlers and their goals. If he does, I think it makes all his talk of pluralism problematic, at least to me.  

If someone could actually create a new religious language that might be helpful. But if R. Lubitz is really serious about being open to the secular, I would think a new univocal religious language should not be high on the agenda. A basic feature of secular thought and life is that the language keep on morphing, new ideas, new ways with one language replacing the other at a rapid pace. My suspicion is that he is more into tasting than being in the modern world.]]></description>

Eric,
see Reshut Harabim where he has a teshuvah. He specifically mentions that even those that have what to teach, such as Rav Wolbe should be avoided. But consistency is not a virtue of his responsa or responses.]]></description>
