					<description><![CDATA[So, we cannot all be kotzkers, unless somehow we all come to it on our own.  Makes for a strange sort of paradox. 

Anyway, I found much truth in Schorsch&#039;s self portrait.  We all look for our own voice in this world, breaking the previous generations voice.  Yet we forget that we are mere mortals who cannot know all.  Eventually, the next generation begins to see that we are not the be all and end all of all discussion, thus they also explore.  The challenge is the obvious need to let go. 

In terms of the image of Terach and Abraham, I think the real fear, not mentioned, is that eventually the Abraham goes out on his own, and all that is left of the Terach is VaYamat Terach B&#039;Haran, that Terach dies without fulfilling his ultimate goal.   In a sense, the final element of the metaphor might be the seeming irrelevance of the previous generation.  Yet, we know that the ideal is to look to the previous generation for wisdom in old age.  Perhaps, this is part of why the one idol was not destroyed.  We can destroy the idols of the previous generation, but something must remain as a connection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blumenberg bemoans those who do not know how to let institutions do the heavy lifting for them and insist on forging their own path. Perhaps children more exposed to the terrible absolutism of reality would appreciate the daylight between it and them granted them by the munificently false Gods. 

Of course, there is a kind of economy here which itself might actually need smashing. Sadly for potential Abrahams, such idols no longer are sold in a place marked &quot;Idol Store.&quot; 

Relatedly, one wonders if old Terah&#039;s competitors finally caught a break from his deranged child&#039;s iconoclasm.]]></description>
