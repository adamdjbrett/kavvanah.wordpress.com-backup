					<description><![CDATA[ADDeRabbi
indie minyanim and havurot are different in ethos.
I was not at the Hadar conference last month and will not be at the Federation one on new spaces next week, so I have less first hand details. 
But Elie Kaunfer&#039;s new book on indie minyan&#039;s has been described by a reviewer as geared for the MBA and consultant crowd, little havurah ethos. The model is  a corporate managerial feel where the lower rungs int he pyramid are trained in synagogue skills. 
I may discuss the book at some point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This trend was noted in Bill Bishop&#039;s &quot;The Big Sort&quot; (2008).  There has been a rise in megachurches because they played to the stratified, homogenized communities (virtual and otherwise) that rose naturally since the post-World War II explosion of mobility.  

I believe that growth has stopped because of over-expansion, not because the market need for a homogenized service has gone away.  There are still lots of people who want it -- just not as many as were built for.  

And  the people interested in older notions of redemption and repentance, being underserved, started building their own institutions.  Bishop writes about one that started in the mid-2000&#039;s in Chicago.    The same is likely to occur in Jewish environments (and given ADDeRabbi&#039;s comment, perhaps began at the same time).]]></description>
