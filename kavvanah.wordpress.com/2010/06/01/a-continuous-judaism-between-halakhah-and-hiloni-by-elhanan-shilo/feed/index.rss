The school of Kotzk- Izbitz is more elitist, existential decision, individualism. Market forces and functionality does not fit with such individuality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also don&#039;t think this will work, but for different reasons.  

If we advocate a return to the American model of mixed seating between the segregated seating (and the like), we need to understand what brought it about, and why it fell into disuse.  I suspect that it came about because a small number of institutions needed to serve a large number of people with a range of different preferences.  

Network television served the same purpose for many years.  There were three major television networks, and they had to satisfy a wide range of  TV-viewing preferences.  As cable TV and other media options became viable, though, viewers migrated to the niches that serve their individual preferences more precisely than the big networks.  As a result, the big networks have been losing market dominance.

Similarly, as the number of Jewish institutions have grown, they have tended to focus on a more precise niche, lest they lose members who could go elsewhere for a more exact match to their needs.   Most people don&#039;t want diversity -- it&#039;s hard work.  They gravitate to mirrors.

So I doubt there will be much demand in the religious marketplace for institutions in this model.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shilo seems to be saying that we ought to see halakhic praxis in functional terms where actual content is subsidiary to a grander idea of commitment to sets of norms that remedy the malaise of the modern identity and promote social cohesion.

Does he realize that this orientation is antithetical to the overarching ideology of orthodoxy where practice, belief, and intention are cognitively intertwined? This goes beyond some mutual construction by exclusion of religious and secular. 

So who has this kind of functionalist orientation now? Apparently only &quot;intellectual elites.&quot; (people affiliated with Hartman?) 

האופציות החדשות יכולות להתחיל מאליטה אינטלקטואלית, וייתכן שזו תתפשט בשלב מאוחר יותר גם לתוך שכבות עממיות שיזעזעו את המבצרים האידיאולוגיים הדתיים-הלכתיים והחילוניים כאחד, יפרקו את הדיכוטומיה הדתית-חילונית, ויהוו פרק חדש בתולדות העם היהודי.

If that is the case then I don&#039;t see this taking off anytime soon - unless post-orthodoxy itself gains significantly more momentum.]]></description>
