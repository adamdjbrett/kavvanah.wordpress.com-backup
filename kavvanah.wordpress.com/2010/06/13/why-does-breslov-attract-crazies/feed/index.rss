					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/why-does-breslov-attract-crazies/#comment-1207&quot;&gt;Eiver LaNahar&lt;/a&gt;.

Why is everybody always pickin&#039; on me? :-)

Jon B&#039;s chavrusa has it right about the strength/weakness of Breslov. It&#039;s oft mentioned in certain Breslov circles. Ditto for my blog-posted defense re: &quot;crazies.&quot;

But no, Jon B., nothing in the water. I and my brother (also a Breslover) left Woodmere well before Reb Weinberger shlit&quot;a arrived.

I&#039;m only 6&#039; 5&quot;, it&#039;s my brother who&#039;s the Guiness aficionado, Reb Chaim Kramer did not supply me with my first &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#039;s Wisdom,&quot; but, alas, tragically, I am still a novice harmonica player.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember Owen Bergman in the heyday of Far Rockaway. He was a seven foot tall tragic poet and novice blues harmonica player, with a taste for Guinness Stout. 

Then one day a heavy-set dude named Jesse dropped by the White Horse Tavern with a stack of books called &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#039;s Wisdom,&quot; and Owen bought one. 

There was a record of Brendan Behan on the juke box, as we started to read (I was looking over his shoulder)... (Juke box: &quot; &#039;Tis love and whiskey / makes old men frisky / &#039;tis love and porter / makes young men decay...&quot;) The first page said that you can&#039;t remember the vision you just had the other day, due to its unique and ephemeral nature. We both related to this instantly. Thus, Owen became &quot;Ozer,&quot; and Ewen became &quot;Eiver,&quot; and today we limit ourselves to two &quot;l&#039;chaim&quot;s  at the Shabbos evening meal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I recall correctly, Ozer used to be called by his English name (Owen), and grew up in the Far Rockaway/Five Towns mostly-Modern Orthodox  community of the 1960 and 70&#039;s that was home to Rabbis Miller, Rackman, Wurzburger, Freifeld, Bulman, Pelcovitz, Chait, Klaperman and others. 

He&#039;s certainly been on a long, strange journey.]]></description>

The strength of Breslov is that anybody can become Breslov, but the weakness of Breslov is that _anybody_ can become Breslov.]]></description>
