					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/shmuly-yanklowitz-reincarnation-and-a-moral-conscience/#comment-1169&quot;&gt;Joseph&lt;/a&gt;.

I can&#039;t help but be skeptical of this &quot;objective fact&quot; category. It seems unlikely that we&#039;re going to ascertain the truth of soul reincarnation, so some kind of consequentialism isn&#039;t the worst way to go about it. As to your second point, I&#039;m also very skeptical that gilgul can be used to excuse behavior. Anyone who would be willing to participate in this gilgul-belief is someone who isn&#039;t looking for a trapdoor out of working hard. If you don&#039;t want to be frum, there are easier ways than believing something new -- like not believing anything at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi
I find R. Yanklowitz&#039;s conclusion very original and thought-provoking. But, like the previous commenter,  I do have a problem basing our belief in an objective fact (whether souls are reincarnated or not) on what it may or may not achieve - is this not a projection of what we would like to believe onto reality? Moreover, one could take the opposite tack and argue that a belief in gilgul allows people to work less hard in this life. For instance, if everyone needs to come back multiple times to learn through Pardes, then why would people try to prioritize their learning or attempt to cover the most ground that they can? On a more basic level, the ability to treat every day as if it is one&#039;s last day, as Avot suggests, hinges on the view that if we don&#039;t take action to improve the world now, we might not get a second chance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What troubles me first is that this seems to recapitulate ethics as universal egoism. Perhaps akrasia can be overcome by appealing to the really big picture of what&#039;s in it for me? 

We are all interconnected in myriad ways to other people who nonetheless remain irreducibly other. When we lack motivation to act in ways that are other-regarding is it for want of metaphysics? 

I am also especially put off by his opening disclaimer where he treats this exercise as a thought experiment and temporary suspension of disbelief. If the exercise leaves one with a warm fuzzy feeling then apparently one can acquire the belief!. Are our theological commitments so weak that they can be tried on for size over the course for a paragraph or two?

We already have enough people whose religious worldviews are mere accretions of things they&#039;ve heard from kindergarten through the occasional shabbos afternoon shiur without a moments reflection on whether anything coherent emerges. At this point I think that &quot;Hashem is Magic&quot; sums up the beliefs of 90% of Orthodox Jews. So go ahead, throw in one more, it won&#039;t matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could this op-ed have just as easily (if not more easily) stated using the concept of Yechida of the soul? Not only do you get the same sort of &quot;we&#039;re all in this together,&quot; but it contains within it stuff like tikkun + Moshiach. I&#039;m surprised that something like gilgul (which still feels fairly exotic today and more closely associated with Hinduism than Judaism) would be used instead of something like Yechida which can do the same heavy lifting and feels a little more normative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is such a wonderful post inasmuch as in includes elements of a kind of distanciation effect which is necessary for all hermeneutics. Behind this distanciation I see an allergy to ideology and a belated defense of metaphysics. Belated, inasmuch as you acknowledge the critical chasm separating us from these texts. But a defense nonetheless, as you allow them to blossom forth in their full foreignness. 

When you say you want more God talk, I wonder how this would work, though. Does everyone need to actually interpret texts in order to talk about God? What if the things that precluded Yanklowitz from interpreting are precisely tied to the irretrievable nature of metaphysics after (take your pick) Heidegger, Derrida or even Kant.  

Since we are on the topic of gilgul, I will also note in passing that the Heideggarian destruction of metaphysics begins in the second Nietzsche book with a discussion of eternal recurrence of the same. Heidegger cleverly pointed to the fact that the recurrence of the same implies a heterogeneity of the same from the same.  We are at an impasse where even a correct recapitulation of metaphysics would not generate much besides endless difference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The real position that he wants to hold is that of various 14th century Jewish positions on reincarnation found in manuscripts which have an interchange of energy between plants, animals, and all people.
On this topic see Rami Sheqalim, Reshit Torat Ha- Nefesh v&#039; Ha-Gilgul b&#039;Kabbala b&#039;Meah 12–15 (1994). It was a self-published MA that was excellent.  
The MA was written years before he became a business.

					<description><![CDATA[I think the biggest question this view raises is the relationship between Jews and non-jews.  If a Jew can reincarnate as a baby hindu, does that mean we all have essentially the same soul (going against foundational Kabbalistic views of course)? If not, how can I be really morally responsible for all life?]]></description>
