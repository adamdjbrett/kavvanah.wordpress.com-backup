					<description><![CDATA[Firstly, look and decide. Aside from that the aspect it was the closet chronologically to the Ari {70 yrs} in which a very interesting doctrinal aspect came out as opposed to the later commentaries i.e. the Rashash and the Ramchal who did use the writings of Nathan.
The Ramchal says himself in the אגרות that Nathan received the &#039;holy spirit&#039; during נפילת אפיים and would whisper one&#039;s transgressions and rectifications in their ears. Following this phenomenon, as is known, many believed SZ to be the messiah and Nathan his prophet and sold their belongings to go to the holy land.
But as mentioned firstly examine the writings for yourself and make your own decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of what you have mentioned is true but a bit misconstrued. Whether or not he believed that SZ was the messiah is not clear however in his אגרות ,which contains much doctrinal material aside from correspondence, he mentions SZ as the aspect of of the messiah as a נפל or miscarriage in relation to the &#039;messiahship&#039; of SZ.
He definitely used the writings of Nathan of Gaza as mentioned in the אגרות even referring to a specific matter only found in Nathan&#039;s writings and the Ramhal. Perhaps they had the same magid?
It is know to me  that there are several well know &#039;qabbalists&#039; today in Jerusalem who study Nathan&#039;s works but I am sure they would not want to be known.
As you may be aware some years ago the מטפחת ספרים of the יעב&#039;ץ  was reprinted in a clear fashion and the book was &#039;swiped&#039; from the shelves of bookstores at the behest of the בד&#039;ץ because he took a critical stand against the Zohar so censorship is still in &#039;style&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in the lineage of &#039;lithuanian-style&#039; kabbalah that seems to base itself on the Ramhal and seemed to flourish in Israel in a circle that included (centered on?) Rabbi Chaim Friedlander. A kabbalah for those who are usually assumed to ignore kabbalah. Why particularly did the teaching of the Ramhal have this role? Is the key idea just that that the teaching/myth laid out by the Ari is a mashal and is meant to be decoded/translated into other terms?

According to Tishby in this book, it seems fairly certain that Luzzatto and his circle were Sabbatean--if not believing Shabtai Tzvi himself messiah (designating him only Mashiah ben Yosef), then in adopting the religious system taught by Nathan of Gaza, with its unprecedented role for the person of the messiah in the process of the tikkun. Very hard to digest how someone so extremely on the dangerous fringe of the religion could be identical with the author of Messilat Yesharim.

Reading about the Ketubah, I can&#039;t help wondering about / being afraid for the fate of Luzzatto&#039;s bride--what was she told? how did he relate to her on a human level?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RaMCHaL refers to the Kabbalah as a metaphor (mashal) -- in fact, at the beginning of KLaCH Pischey Chokhmah, I believe -- for which he has been taken to task by disciples of the RaSHaSH and others. Wouldn&#039;t that indicate a &quot;symbolic&quot; approach, despite the abstract-rationalist character of his system that some scholars have deemed &quot;scientific&quot; (and, of course, we have some support from the term of the mekubalim themselves, &quot;chokhmas ha-emes&quot;)? 

I&#039;m willing to be convinced otherwise, but for the time being, it seems to me that the arbitrary imposition of these categories is too often like fitting square pegs into round holes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see that. What I mean to ask though is aren&#039;t these to elements difficult to reconcile in the same thinker? In the Klach Ramchal seems to follow many discussions of adam kadmon, partsufim, olamos etc. with statements such as: really all of this is just to make it easier on the ear, we have no hasaga of any of this, and the point is that everything goes in a chain of atzilus in order to turn the ra into tov.
Doesn&#039;t this attitude stand in contradiction to having such literal interactions with multiple divine entities?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I cannot agree with Eiver&#039;s sharp formulation: &quot;to suggest a causal relationship would be preposterous,&quot; I do wonder whether we put too much emphasis on the differences between thinkers from different time periods (baroque, renaissance, counter reformation, etc.). While I do believe that there is probably some causal influence on Jewish thinkers, like any other, from Western thought, are these thinkers not at least as strongly influenced by the thought of their predecessors whose teachings they took very seriously. Although the differences are very important to highlight, I think most often there are more similarities between the thought of a 16th century Kabbalist and a late 18th century Kabbalist than there are differences.

Another, unrelated, question. Dr. Brill, you wrote, &quot;Ramhal played almost no part in Gershom Scholem’s writings since Luzzatto treated kabbalah as either scientific or as theological providence,not as symbolism.&quot;

I do not understand how this fits with the view of Ramchal as baroque, focused on angelic visitors and multiplying entities. I think I understand how neither the scientific/providence approach nor the baroque/angelic visitor approach are congruent with Scholem&#039;s symbolic approach. But I do not understand how the scientific/providence approach and the baroque/angelic visitor approach fit with each other.
I have been trying to make it through the Klach Pischei Chochmah over the last few weeks (I&#039;ve tried and failed before), and I see the the theological providence approach much more evident than the baroque.]]></description>

Just got back from parts north. To continue where we left off, there is mention of an argument between Reb Nachman of Breslov and the Rav of Alisk (I think -- didn&#039;t look it up) about the appearance of the Malakh Metat in a vision.  This took place at least a little later than the period of the Vilna Gaon. I also recall some visionary material in the writings of R. Yehudah Ftaya, maybe in Minchas Yehudah, maybe elsewhere. 

As for contemporary kabbalists, again, most people are squeamish about committing such things to writing. But I imagine that they still happen. (Not to me, though, for better or worse...)

It would take some serious persuading for me to agree with the presumption that western secular historical categories like &quot;baroque,&quot; &quot;modernist,&quot; etc., transfer to the world of Jewish (or other) traditional enclaves. Academics might ponder the possible common ground or zeitgeist shared by the Baal Shem Tov and Swedenborg and contemporaneous Russian Orthodox visionaries, or the Maggid of Mezritch and Hakuin Zenji, or Reb Nachman and Beethoven and William Blake. But to suggest a causal relationship would be preposterous.
