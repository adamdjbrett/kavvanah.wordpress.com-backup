					<description><![CDATA[The financial and identity issues are always present. Eating out costs money. 

Additionally, not eating out or eating out  fosters an identity which is a mixture of religion/class/education/etc.

There is also the social aspect of eating out. Stay-at-home mothers in Borough Park &#038; Flatbush 
socialize at pizza shops. Singles on the West Side at the Pizza Stores etc.

It is, for some, an alternative to Synagogues as a center for community, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think there is more here than economics.  a generation or two ago kashrut created a culture in most locales of eating only at home.  Now eating out at the local kosher eatery has real social/cultural significance. note the controversies in various frum communities about the appropriateness/value of a Kosher pizza place. I have heard people in Alon shvut say they are glad there is no pizza there like in efrat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Far too many unexplored variables to make this a worthwhile study on its own, IMHO, and of course, there&#039;s always the important &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/552/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;caveat about correlation and causation&lt;/a&gt;.  

Assuming that there is a correlation between religiosity and income level, it&#039;s probably at least just as valid to say that the &lt;b&gt;former&lt;/b&gt; determines the &lt;b&gt;latter&lt;/b&gt; (i.e., more &quot;frum&quot; Jews eschew money-making opportunities, have larger families and hence less discretionary income, etc.)

It might also be interesting to survey &lt;i&gt;how often&lt;/i&gt; people dine out as related to how much they spend. It&#039;s quite possible, for example, that religious families go out to eat no more than their non-religious counterparts, but due to (a) higher price of kosher food, and (b) larger number of mouths to feed, they wind up spending proportionally more per trip.]]></description>
