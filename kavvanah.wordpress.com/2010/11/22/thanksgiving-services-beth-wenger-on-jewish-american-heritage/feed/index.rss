					<description><![CDATA[Freedom and Democracy overrides halacha. Rule and authority can be based only on two things: Reason or consent. The greatness of Torah in a yeshiva environment is that it is based on consent and a has well defined, mutual goal. 
But though you are right that democracy and Torah are not necessarily mutually compatible there is still something very clear--the abject absolute miserable failure of up to bottom systems imposed by some halachic elite. No self respecting Jew can or should give to any self elected strata of rabbis authority over ourselves in religious or any other matters. --though we should learn and keep the Talmud but that should be with the understanding that there are limits to the validity of the Talmud.
This should not be taken as an insult. Everyone has limits to areas of validity. even Socrates who was perhaps one of the most admirable human beings that ever existed had limits. His close students were not a very moral bunch. And as much as it might be fun for us to poke fun at him and pretend that we are so much more superior but we should be aware that our own moral system would not survive a ten minute conversation with Socrates.]]></description>
