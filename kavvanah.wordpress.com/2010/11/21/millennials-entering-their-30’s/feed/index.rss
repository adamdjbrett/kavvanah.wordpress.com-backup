					<description><![CDATA[Although I don&#039;t dispute that the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s had their own particular cultural challenges, it could be that most of the members of this group happen to be from the 90&#039;s (it is not &quot;for&quot; class members from the 90&#039;s, it just HAPPENS to be the core group that joined -- so far --are ages 30-40 or so) because people older than we are don&#039;t use Facebook as much as we do, and people younger than we are are still too young to want to reflect back on their high school experience in a truly adult, mature, 20/20 way. A younger alum commented on the group to the effect that he can&#039;t believe what losers we are, still talking about high school, and that we should &quot;get over it.&quot; We told him to wait another 5 or 10 years and perhaps he&#039;d feel differently.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[God this was a profoundly depressing post for so many reasons personal and communal. I became religious over this same time apart from any day school, but it makes sense of the pervasive apathy I see in the communities made up of such people, a disinterest at best of attracting people to the Judaism of the riotous remnant - the communally-committed Orthoprax, vacation-frei and suburban O resigners. Let any comers to Torah be drawn into the orbit of Haredi kiruv disneyland it seems. And even they&#039;ve changed; the tag lines used to be about &quot;search for truth&quot;, basecamps for truth quests since abandoned for selling Jewish &quot;pleasure principles&quot;, etc, etc...]]></description>

Presumably &quot;Rabbi Q&quot; would not be as shocked if you told him you were a heretical academic as if you told him you were a cross-dressing sex worker. 
(Does anyone care if you are a &quot;heretic academic&quot; if you live in Bergen County and send your kids to day school)

So the criteria are really about whether you have queered yourself to to the extent that your lifestyle is incompatible with bourgeois suburban modern orthodoxy  and thereby achieved otherness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know we only have these 400 words to go on, but let&#039;s look at it for what it&#039;s worth. W
hat jumps off the page  is the empahsis on the body.    Obviously, this is written tongue in cheek,  but still:  
               &quot;But are you also, say, gay, a cross dresser, a sex worker, a heretic?&quot;

3/4 there  (even though  cross-dresser and especially sex-worker are simply to &#039;mix things up&#039;).
            &quot;Are you married to a gentile? Did you marry a gentile of the same              
             sex? Have you written for porno magazines? &quot;
Once again.
            &quot;Do you refer to yourself as Conservative? &quot;
What could this mean.  Do we have kids from MO schools specifically identifying as Conservative Jews as opposed to post-denom/non-denom? This is perhaps the most surprising to me.

Fascinatingly, there is no &quot;are you a heretic academic&quot;, &quot;do you assume that the Torah was written by multiple authors,&quot; &quot;are you a hasid of Kugel&quot; &quot;do you pray with an egalitarian minyan&quot;, &quot;do you not like the chauvenism&quot; et al.  In this text, I would go as far to say that the use of &quot;heretic&quot; and &quot;apikorsim&quot; do not seem to be linked to a system of beliefs (aside fom the Conservative / think for yourself) rather people who are doing non-Orthodox things - especially sexual ones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a guess:
This has to do with the total lack of creative and courageous leadership in the american modern orthodox world .  

Who wants to be part of a movement that has no leaders willing to grapple with our rapidly changing world ? It&#039;s not very reassuring when you grow up and realize that the supposed intellectuals of your religion are grappling with issues that the rest of society seems to have dealt with years ago. 
 I know there are many many great challenges to reconciling the world we live in with orthodoxy but somebody could at least try! Teenagers respect honesty and can easily smell fear. If we had grown up with leaders who faced difficult issues publicly and head on, some of us might have stuck around. All they had to do was try to stay relevant to us. Try to keep apace with society. 
I’m not referring here to the average young Israel pulpit rabbi, but to the heavyweights in YU and wherever else. The ones who should have written something (anything!) worth reading. 
All we had to look to was a Rav who was no longer present or fit to the task by the time we came around.  Was there anybody else? Maybe, but they were certainly never mentioned. 
Maybe it&#039;s different in Israel?]]></description>

That might be a turnoff to thoughtful adults, but that&#039;s certainly not the dynamic in high school which is much more about conflicts over  resistance to popular culture, conflicting messages about whether your parents are actually religious by your teacher&#039;s standards, conflicting messages about how much sexual latitude you have etc.

That tension breeds cynicism among high school kids.]]></description>

completely disagree, AS.  &quot;centrist&quot; people seem to have a hard time seeing this, but on the things that alienated people they are quite like the yeshivish.   centrist truth claims still fundamentally in conflict with contemporary science/academia, centrist halacha is still fundamentally incompatible with contemporary values, and the centrists, rather than even engaging in apologetics (which yeshivish would), tend to glorify that conflict and urge subbordination of ethics to law - that approach is a huge turnoff to people who want to be (or just are) engaged in the broader world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure which school this was, but the 90&#039;s may have been the peak of a culture clash in modern orthodox and community day schools where the religious faculty was dominated by rabbis coming from more  right wing yeshivot. At some point some of these schools (mostly those that were coed) woke up and decided it was worth paying more to attract young centrist teachers from YU.

Just a thought.]]></description>
