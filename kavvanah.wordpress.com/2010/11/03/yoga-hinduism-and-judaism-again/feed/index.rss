					<description><![CDATA[Namasthe:  It is true that YOGA came from Hinduism [ I like to call it HINDU CULTURE since it is a culture]

But YOGA is beyond Hinduism.

YOGA is a practice of taking care of body and mind for mental peace as well as for &quot;Spiritual Maturity.&quot;  

 The word Yoga is  FIRST  defined by sage  Patanjali in his book Patanjali Yoga Sutra. 
He summarized YOGA as    CHITTA VRITHI NIRODHA. 

CHITTA means MIND 
VRITTI means VIBRATIONS 
NIRODHA means STOPPAGE

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up Jewish in Bombay till I was 19 and then made aliya. We were proud Jews in India and it was always clear what idolatry consisted of - we Indian Jews have always had an instinctive sense of it. All the stuff from Masechet Avoda Zarah is still living tradition out there. But  India is a good place to learn how to refine one&#039;s beliefs precisely because of the multiplicity of devout (and sometimes gullible) pathways  to worship. And you can&#039;t help but love the Indian amcha. 

Personally, it was precisely these kinds of experiences in India (and Israel for that matter) which led me to find circuitous affinity with mystics like Abraham Maimonides and Abulafia, the Jewish Yogis of yore.

Jerusalem does have something to offer Mumbai - it is simply the study of Torah and the Kabbalah. I don&#039;t have high hopes that they will listen though:)]]></description>

An interesting place to look for an answer to that question might be in the Kabbala circles attracting non-Jews.  Are the celebrity adherents of the entirely Westerners?  Or are there people of Indian descent who know yoga, don&#039;t like it, and would prefer to cleave to Phillip Berg?]]></description>

EJ-
Back to the thought experiment- How do you see the spiritual difference after 20 years and where do you see the Judaism of both groups? 
Is there a middle ground? Does Jerusalem have anything to offer Mumbai?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that the problem with yoga from an organized religion’s perspective is that these exercises are part of a larger group of activities to which the yoga practitioner is drawn. For example, not smoking, healthy eating, homeopathy and alternative medicines, jogging and running,  gym classes from pilates to Nia and Zumba, as well as  meditation, and outdoor activities like hiking and climbing. But we’re not done. There is alternative travel, like to Papua New Guinea, Bhutan and Peru, shaman healing practices, chanting, drumming. There are detoxifying diets, no alcholol, no coffee, no white flour, no meat, no foods with high glycemic index, and preferably no milk or wheat products. The center of this culture is the yoga studio and Whole Foods aka Whole Paycheck.  

As a gedanken-experiment let us imagine 2 groups of Jews, say each with a 1000 people. Both work full time. The first leads the yoga-Whole Food style, the second davens, learns, sees a therapist if necessary, and goes on a treadmill 2-3 times a week. Fast forward 20 years and both groups are now in their 50-60s. The yoga crowd will be stronger, more flexible, in better health with fewer incidents of the killing diseases than the davening learning crowd. No longer can people say gashmiyus leads to decadence and sickness. Just the opposite.  This is a problem for organized religion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First:  I see Hinduism&#039;s ownership of yoga, in the present world, in the same way that I see Shaolin&#039;s ownership of QiGong, Kung Fu, Japanese karate and all the other practices they spawned.   And, for that matter, in the same way I see Judaism&#039;s owernship of the Christianity that grew out of it.  It&#039;s proper to appreciate the roots, and it&#039;s fair not to be bound by them.  

Second:  if the practices are done in a gym, but done correctly -- whether in Yoga, Kung Fu or whatever -- they have the same results, regardless of  whether they&#039;re called spiritiually-oriented.   The degree of kashrut is a matter of a) compentency -- the more competent, the less kosher; and b) branding -- the more one calls awareness to the spirituality of the practices, the less kosher they appear.]]></description>
