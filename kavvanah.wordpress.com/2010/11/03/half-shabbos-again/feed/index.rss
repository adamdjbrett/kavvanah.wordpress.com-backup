					<description><![CDATA[Steve, as nice as your analysis is as a piece of rhetoric it does not explain why this has been going on since emancipation. In a world where people see themselves as individuals with the possibility of making choices  that they can comfortably live with there is no simple reason why some people leave and some stay. A given religious community will never speak to everyone who grows up within its ranks. The question for those interested in a pragmatic response is how do we retain 75 -90 percent of those who grow up in religious households, not what are parents clearly doing wrong when one of their kids decides to text his friend on shabbos. I have never seen a productive suggestion in response to the latter. 

I think that your response comes from a particular time and place where people thought that sending all kids to day schools would solve their problems. So you look at the fact that it did not and then lay the blame back on parents. Give people, both parents and children,  a little more credit for being complex individuals whose paths in life are not overdetermined by any sets of necessary and sufficient criteria for lifelong religious affiliation  that you could possibly enumerate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps, the real issue that we are all missing is that one must be inspired to live a life committed to Torah and Mitzvos before one is educated and socialized to do so. We must remember that Yetizas Mitzrayim led to Kabalas HaTorah and not the reverse. When teens text on Shabbos, I think that one can argue that they lack the hashkafic fundamentals on why a Jew observes Shabbos. Merely doing so because that is the custom of one&#039;s parents or one&#039;s community cannot be considered a solid fundamental basis in the absence of  knowledge of why Shabbos plays such a central role in Maaseh Breishis and Kabalas HaTorah.

 I am sure that all of us know of someone either our own age or a child’s age who has gone OTD. I think that the problem begins with parents who lack a certain passion for being a Shomer Torah UMitzvos. When one combines a lack of passion with an equal dose of cynicism, then one should not be surprised if a kid becomes a Mchallel Shabbos and worse after 12 years of Jewish education-Charedi or MO.]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my non-Ashkenazi friends &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

Different Edot had different patterns of religiosity and should not be lumped together. In practice, many of the old-time Ashkenazim were the same way. If you visited a cousin in Givatayim or Haifa, they kept kosher and some form of shabbat, and they also went to the soccer game. The Menachem Begins types were not much different. I acknowledge that many of those of Moroccan background seemed more laissez-faire and some of the Sefardic leadership like Rav Ovadiah was cool with it. But we need a good definition of what was, and is, the unique quality of the sefardi societies. Meir Buzaglo of Hebrew U has several nice essays on the mesorati mentality (Maybe I should blog them.) and there was recently a volume on the topic. American literature of the time saw them as proto-Conservative Jews who would naturally support the Conservative movement.  To compare to Europe, there was widespread giving up of observance in places like Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, - and Rav Ovadiah was as sharp as any Ashkenazi Rabbi with them when he was Rabbi in Egypt. He liked those who transgressed in simplicity more than those who modernized and became secular. Syria and Iraq had diverse reactions to modernity.  See Benny Brown&#039;s Response to Zvi Zohar for some of the less accepting positions among Sefardim; also see A Pikard&#039;s work on Rav Ovadiah for his not tolerating his assimilationists.

Reb Yudel- those who kept people into Judaism  included NCSY, Reb Shlomo, Rabbis Lichtenstein and Greenberg, AJ Heschel, Meir Kahane and Art Waskow, Riskin and Kushner, the rise of the havurot, chabad sending its first shilichim to college campuses, some dedicated Hillel directors, The Jewish Catalog, and many other people who stopped speaking of the assumed need to be committed to a boring synagogue and stopped addressing the 1950&#039;s suburbia. All but Heschel who died young, already had structures in place when people returned in the 1980&#039;s. How many of today&#039;s day school graduates who walk into McDonalds and then never return to Jewish life as opposed to those who stay involved will be based on today&#039;s leadership.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How would you compare the European example to non-Ashkenazi populations?  Do we observe similar moves?  In the 70s and 80s in Israel, I always had a sense that my non-Ashkenazi friends had a greater, flexible comfort with Judaism.  It was pretty common to see someone in the synagogue Shabbat morning, engaged and participating; but after Shabbat lunch head off to the soccer pitch.  No one (among the Sefardim) said &#039;they&#039;ve left the fold&#039;.  It didn&#039;t have to be an either-or, all-or-nothing understanding.]]></description>

What sort of steps determine amplitude? 

What actors and actions would you credit with the amplitudes of 1960? Of 1840?]]></description>

We just started. Ask me as we wind down in 2030.  I cannot predict the future.  From a quick look, it seems this one will be mystical-spiritual like the 1840&#039;s cycle of the Transcendentalists. I dont think this cycle will have the language of &quot;Secular City&quot; of the 1960&#039;s. Amplitude will be determined by steps that people take right now.]]></description>
