					<description><![CDATA[I found the Biale essay a big to-do about nothing. What follows from all these precursors? Are we going to follow Issac Deutscher and sign up with the Trotskyites, stick with George Steiner and reminisce of the great Central European –Jewish  sensibility   or follow Harold Bloom/F.R. Leavis and dream of Jews who spend their days reading only the very best books ?  Each way has plenty of precursors. 
Suppose we could devise a common Jewish culture wide enough and interesting enough to create a commonality between Jews of all stripes, would it accomplish anything in practice? Imagine a sort of Jewish studies core curriculum, (Tanach, Talmud, Kabbalah understood in thick ways),  that served as a common foundation for the secular, the  Orthodox and the  Reform branches of the Jewish people. And now in grand rabbinical style we decide everyone must know their way about these  classic works, &#038; everyone must be open to the secular readings, and the permutations  of these classics in secular directions. 
Three problems. To achieve this you have to get almost the entire Jewish people in remedial adult education classes into the indefinite future. But suppose as if by magic this was accomplished. Would the ability to talk a common language based on the same education solve the culture wars in Israel? And would this solid training of all Diaspora Jews significantly reduce intermarriage? In both cases  I think not, but who knows for sure what would result from such a radical change? I worry the idea of a Torah based Jewish culture that would be adequate for all the tribes of Israel might be something of a fantasy.

I tried something along these lines in a post called “Geek Judaism.”

					<description><![CDATA[Yerushalmi&#039;s answer was the study of Jewish History without theological agendas. Biale seems close to a theological agenda like Green or Eisen. Concern for Zohar reading, Tzimtzum and Gershom Scholem seems more Green than Yerushalmi. 
A 92th street Y catalog seems closer to secular Jewish identity. This seems likes it for academics.
On your first point, I guess that is my question.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;a theology of secular academic Jewish studies&quot;

Then would the response be the theology of religious academic Jewish studies? Unfortunately, to the extent that there is such a thing it speaks entirely to those who are committed to both already. 

If Biale&#039;s project is essentially a continuation of what Yerushalmi termed &quot;the faith of fallen Jews&quot;, then is the faith of semi-fallen Jews an alternative really worth articulating? 

The real answer is that if Jewish secularism had found all the necessary components to serve as the functional cultural equivalents of religion then his book would be superfluous.]]></description>
