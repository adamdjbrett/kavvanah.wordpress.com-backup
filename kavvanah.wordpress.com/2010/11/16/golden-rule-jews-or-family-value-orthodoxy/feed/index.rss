					<description><![CDATA[Re: obliviousness of the Jewish-educated  laity.

My Jewish education from kindergarten through Yeshiva College was composed (in volume order descending) of a) tanach and talmud, b) ritual, and c) Jewish history.  Perhaps I was out sick every time they covered Jewish philosophy; I certainly don&#039;t remember being tested on any.  

With that kind of background, obliviousness to doctrinal lines should be no surprise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was able to relate to a lot of what Ammerman wrote, in terms of social, lived religion as opposed to anything theological or denominational.  In fact, most of my congregants do not identify as Orthodox.  On Sunday morning the breakfast that follows Shacharit regularly runs for hours, as parents drop off kids at Hebrew School, sit down, grab some food, congregants come and go, and so on.

&quot;The parts of the service that involved participation and introspection seemed most important.&quot;  In fact, for us the highlights of the service (judging from people&#039;s faces and mannerisms) usually are the prayers for America and the State of Israel, and the Prayer for the Sick (the misheberach).  I would argue that, rather than transcendence, people are looking for connection to those around them.]]></description>

To both tesyaa and Arie,
I want to leave 19th century and early 20th century cases out becuase they have differences from fin-de siecle 20th century [upper] middle suburbia.

tesya, yes it is remarkable that people who had a day school education, sent their kids to day school, and now have grandchildren in day school can be completely oblivious. They think that day school orthodoxy is about being nice, teaching family values, the importance of the heritage, and connection to Judaism.  But in the end it is a good neighbor orthodoxy.]]></description>

I tried to make my comment non-specific.  

I&#039;m familiar with both the ideologues and the &quot;oblivious&quot; believers you describe.  I was wondering if the Golden Rule description applies to all non-ideologues, or is specifically referring to those who do not know more.

I would describe many women and some men who arrived from the old country 100 years ago as lacking the education to distinguish between ideologies.  What&#039;s interesting is that with the exception of some baalai tshuva, today&#039;s Orthodox Jews have received extensive religious education or have had the opportunity to do so.  If, as you say, they remain &quot;oblivious&quot;, that is a remarkably interesting fact.]]></description>

tesyaa, 
Then you  may already be a specific variety of liberal believer. Oblivious really means oblivious. There are really many out there who only notice if the nursery is good and if there are good groups for kids. They do not know that the demarcations actually exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;They are oblivious to both doctrine and practice demarcations.&lt;/i&gt;

What about those people who are not oblivious to but who do not care about the demarcations, or,  more likely, do not wish to enter into debate about the demarcations?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can totally confirm your description of Golden Rule Orthodoxy as the norm out there, at least from my experience of several years in the pulpit.

I also think that this is in general the dominant form of religious life, whether nowadays in the suburbs, or during the 19th century shtetls, or in the then contemporary bourgeois Neo-Orthodox in Germany. Most people are not ideologues. They have deeply felt, genuine emotions, but they are not necessarily ideologues.]]></description>
