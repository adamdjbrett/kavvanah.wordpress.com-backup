					<description><![CDATA[Len- you have a lot of begged premises, but conservatives will probably treat the parts they like as ex-cathedra. 
Yerachmiel- Your out of your league. When Rabbi Shaar Yashuv Cohen spoke at the synod of Bishops or the various Israeli Rabbis spoke when Benedict visited Israel, they had none of the concerns of your American orthodox-liberal divide.
Dont use the incorrect gossip of Orthodox laity to evaluate the situation. The Israeli Rabbis are not part of the 1965 American debates. In fact, Rabbi Metzger&#039;s speech did in fact make theological requests.
And I was not asking for a theological discussion. Pope Benedict has repeated said that Patristic anti-Judaism is wrong and should be rejected. I was just asking for someone to remind him of his own agenda in order that he leave behind a full text of his thoughts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You write:  &quot;Jews should have tackled more fundamental issues of historical anti-Jewish texts.&quot;

It seems to me that the orthodox resistance to dialogue (on theological aspects of the relationship) makes that difficult. Liberal Jews have done that.

I hear your argument, but I also understand that there is a pragmatic side that wants to focus on behavior in the here and now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but for the hardliners within the Church, if it&#039;s not spoken Ex Cathedra or as a result of a Council, it&#039;s not &quot;very binding&quot;.]]></description>
