					<description><![CDATA[Part of the challenge may also be how to acknowledge the distinct contribution other religions make while still making use of the those teachings found within Jewish sources. We need a system a that allows us to appreaciate the distinct contribution of Hovot Halevavot or Reshit Hokhmah alongside the Bhagavad Gita. While some obviously prefer to pretend that everything can found within a Jewish source, the tendency to minimize the spiritual theological contributions of Judaism may be no less dangerous. This is a trap that Rav Lichtenstein often falls in to as you point out in your article &quot;Judaism in Culture&quot; . We need to find a way to recognize the way in which these ideas have been discussed in other cultures and then trace there development within Judaism. If we focus too much on the religious culture of others we risk ignoring or at least minimizing our own.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Judaism is not a world religion in the way Catholicism and Islam are world religions. Looking at the document “Dialogue and Proclamation” here are some significant differences. 1)Evangelization in the sense of bringing “the Good News into all areas of humanity, and through its impact, to transform that humanity from within, making it new&quot; “ is not a mission of Judaism. With the possible exception of Lubavitch we do not  feel any need to preach to the people of the world. 2)Even in the context of dialogue, other than taking up an attitude of respect and friendship, Judaism does not feel an obligation either  to give witness to its own convictions or to explore the respective religious convictions of other faiths. It might be permissible, but why would Judaism say it is obligatory other than for reasons that are dependent on the special local conditions and circumstances. The Ramban did not welcome, but reluctantly agreed to a disputation. 3) the Jewish people unlike the church have no interest in missionary activity for the purpose of conversion. (The recent statement by the Conservative Movement that we ought to welcome those non Jews who married Jews while encouraging conversion, is either an exception or a sign that 3) is no loner obvious.  4) We have a moral, though not necessarily a religious obligation, “ to stand up for human rights, proclaim the demands of justice, and denounce injustice not only when their own members are victimized, but independently of the religious allegiance of the victims. There is need also to join together in trying to solve the great problems facing society and the world, as well as in education for justice and peace.” But this obligation has significant exceptions, in particular where there is great danger in such proclamations. I do not feel any obligation to personally create a democracy in China, precisely because Judaism has not taken literally taken responsibility for the entire world. Our obligations in a democracy that is broadly just are far different from those we might have in a failed gangster state.

This world of dialogue has not been a part of my life , and Judaism may have changed while I was dreaming about other topics. If it has, perhaps someone can cite the relevant prooftexts .]]></description>
