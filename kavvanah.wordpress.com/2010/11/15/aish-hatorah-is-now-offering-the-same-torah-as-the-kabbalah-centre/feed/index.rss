I think the point of the post is that some of us have had entire banquets of Kabbalah from straight Zohar and thirteenth century to sixteenth century and later along with major secondary literature. Until now, we have not come across this specific taste. So maybe this is something new, or takeout from some other establishment down the road. That is not to say it is not good, useful, satisfying or any other adjectives. It just might not have anything to do with Kabbalah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let us review the mission of the Aish Center: to create a renaissance of Jewish pride in New York City.
Rabbi Jacobs is successful at what he does because he knows how to speak to the secular crowd.  He is able to give them a taste of something so huge it cannot be put into words, let alone print, in the form of a blog post that NY&#039;s young, unaffiliated Jews will read.
It&#039;s clear to me that this is just a taste.  32 types would fill volumes, not an article.  
Thank Gd Rabbi Jacobs knows his audience and can speak directly to them.  That&#039;s why you have young Jewish professionals traveling New York City with Rabbi Jacobs in their pocket. 
Give him some credit; he&#039;s dedicated his life to brining Yiddishkeit to the unaffiliated, and he&#039;s doing a phenomenal job.  I am a case in point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have regretted for a long time not learning more remak. 
By the time I got interested in kabalah I was a year away from going to Israel so I did not have time or effort to spend on the remak. All I did was the ari.
But still I am curious what was that post you did a long time ago that i think you said the ari answered something about the zimzum (or something in the zohar) that the remak could not answer by his static system.
But I don’t think it was about the zimzum because to me that looks like a completely lurian doctrine. I think you had said there was something in the zohar that the remak could not explain but the arizal could.]]></description>

The relationship of the two Mekubalim is complex. The ARI had a copy of the Ramak already in Egypt and in many places accepts and builds on the Ramak. On the other end, many of the students intersperse their teachings. There are things in the Etz Hayyim or shemonah shearim that are entirely ramak.]]></description>

Where was your post that you mentioned a long time ago about a problem in the remak that the ari takes care of? Was that about the zimzum? At any rate I just want to say I find your blog often to be a breath of sanity]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could do the same sham thing with a text of Bava Kama if that is what would get people&#039;s attention. Today it happens to be kabbalah. But once kaballah loses its esoteric flavor perhaps they will branch out into other texts.

Did you know that the for avot nizikin correspond to four energies within a person? Oh wait, that&#039;s Hippocratic medicine. Sorry, they correspond to the four nucleotides of DNA . Truly the building blocks of all life. Modern science is only now discovering the ancient  wisdom of Jewish tort law.]]></description>

While there is much to discuss about the pros and cons of &quot;opening&quot; Lurianic kabbala (or any kabbala, for that matter) to the general population, fail to see what bearing that would have on the article by Jacobs. There is no real Kabalah  - Lurianic or otherwise - in the whole article. There&#039;s nothing esoteric there; in fact, there doesn&#039;t appear to be much there at all. It&#039;s just &quot;shake and bake&quot; pseudo-psychology and pseudo-mysticism using Kabalistic terminology without any concern for how the terms are actually used in actual Kabalistic works.]]></description>

When was this point when it was not &quot;opened to the world?&quot; Do you mean the yearlong period when ARI teaches his confraternity in Safed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not understand why the knee jerk response from Aish to people who should know better (Melila) is to make Kabbalah about some kind of mystical praxis thing. I did not ever see Mary Carruthers telling us to get in touch with our inner troubadour while reading contemporaneous (and equally erotically charged) literature. Even mnemotechnics class was not about being &quot;in the zone&quot; with the ancient Rhetorica as Herennium (still used!). And Dante is not about ascending levels with Virgil as you climb to meet your inner Beatrice.  Maybe we need an article on the hermeneutics of magical thinking.]]></description>
