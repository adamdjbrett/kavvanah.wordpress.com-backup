					<description><![CDATA[Did Rabbi Lander ever offer a critque of Modern Orthodoxy (based on the ideas mentioned) it is a a shame that people like him did not help shape Modern Orthodoxy ,I know people  who chose to live in the Yeshiva world(although they philosphically identify as Modern Orthodox ) since they feel economically intimidated by Modern Orthodoxy emphasis of a suburban lifestyle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some random observations: 

It is interesting  that Rav Moshe Feinstein, Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky,  Rav Schach, and the Steipler all signed  a letter condeminng the opening of  a branch  of Touro for women in Israel. 

BTE,  speaking of class, the college tuition for Touro is  considerably less than that of YU. Still,  as I have heard from a very  reliable source, Touro  for women has not been able to make a dent in the  group of modern Orthodox women  High School graduates  who choose to go on  to Stern.  

It is also ironic that Touro  in Israel runs  a Graduate Program for Jewish  Studies, while YU has no such program.]]></description>
