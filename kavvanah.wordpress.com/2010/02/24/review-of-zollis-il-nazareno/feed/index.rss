					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/02/24/review-of-zollis-il-nazareno/#comment-1897&quot;&gt;Alan Brill&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you, Alan. I do not know exactly... In the last years a number of studies have been published in Italy (and in Italian!), probably updated and perhaps more accurate (due to access to archives, including the one of the Jewish community in Rome) with respect to the Weisbord and Sillanpoa&#039;s one. Namely: G.Rigano, Il caso Zolli; a  number of articles by A.Foa and others, even one I wrote (quite obviously, more a testimony than a real study); A.Riccardi, L&#039;inverno più lungo (which does not speak so much about my grandfather, but documents very well the whole situation in Rome at the time); my brother even made a documentary film collecting testimonies on my grandfather in Italy and in Israel. Maybe it should be useful to make these studies and materials known beyond our linguistic province, but I do not know how (if you understand Italian, I can send you some...). Beyond studies, my personal experience is that it is still very difficult to speak about my grandfather in Rome, where the community was so terribly stricken, and many old ones still feel betrayed by him, which is quite understandable. But, mainly with Israeli friends, and also with Italian Jews from other cities (I live in Forlì, near Bologna, and teach at Bologna University) and from younger generations, there is an ongoing sincere and often warm dialogue, which spans from sound reconstructions of historical facts to questions of religious freedom. This same sense of dialogue I&#039;d like to share with all those who might be interested. Thank you again, kol tuv, Maura]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not know to which extent the story was &quot;bizarre&quot;...there was so much suffering, on all parts. Israel Zoller knew well what Nazism was, his own brothers perished in Auschwitz...and I am still trying to know more about the whole situation, given the fact that he was my grandfather. I&#039;d like to better try to understand together...shalom, Maura]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some years ago I became interested in Zolli.  There is an informative book about him by two Americans (Weisbord and Sillanpoa).  To anyone who reads his early books on Jesus and his studies in NT, it is simply incomprehensible how he was appointed CR of Rome - or how he retained his post in Trieste.  A bizarre story.]]></description>
