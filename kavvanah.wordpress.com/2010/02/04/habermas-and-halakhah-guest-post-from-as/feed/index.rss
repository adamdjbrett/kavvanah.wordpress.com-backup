					<description><![CDATA[AS, WADR you are forgetting that Halakha could also be seen as a DISproof of the entire notion of the public sphere. Many historians have pointed out that there were substantive public spheres antedating the epistolary modernity and salon society of Madame de Stael and other Habermasian examples. Halakha could be seen as a public sphere antedating the original public sphere posited by Habermas. 
This historical point is non incidental for Habermas&#039;s theory: if there are modes of communicative rationality that antedate modern functional differentiation, then we need to revise the story of modernity. Instead of the secularization story and rupture (albeit with roots in the lifeworld) which occasions the rise of systems rationality, we have long latencies of similar historical structures wending their way like a brightly colored thread through the tapestry of Jewish history. In order to preserve Habermas, at a minimum you need to say that Halakha is different in modernity from pre-Modern, or that Halakha is not at all communicative rational.
In any case, a lot of these questions go back to what I see as unsustainable systems lifeworld differentiation.

(On public spheres before Habermas see James Van Horn Melton, Rise of the Public; Wetters, The Opinion System. On Structure lifewold being untenable see Fraser&#039;s article on feminism and Habermas in NLR, also Baxter &quot;System and Lifeworld&quot; in Theory and Society 16.1, idem. in Cardozo Law Review 23.2)]]></description>
