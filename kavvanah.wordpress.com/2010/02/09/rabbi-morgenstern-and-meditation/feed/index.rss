Amnon Gross mentioned the herem, not me:) 
Shimon Levy’s 1955 edition of “Chayei HaNefesh” is not a mimeograph but a full blooded critical edition of the Munich manuscript (supervised by Scholem) containing a  detailed analysis of Abulafia&#039;s commentary in the introduction. 
Incidentally, there was another attempt to bring out &quot;scholarly&quot; editions of Abulafia&#039;s works by Rafael Cohen around the same time (1999-2000). Cohen did publish nice editions of &quot;Sefer HaGeula&quot; and Abulafia&#039;s prophetic writings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe Shimon Levy&#039;s 1955 edition of “Chayei HaNefesh” is in the form of a mimeograph with copious footnotes.
Your mention of a &#039;herem&#039; IMO is an imaginary one because sefer ha-hesheq and ohr hasechel were published almost simultaneously in Mea Sheariim by locals in an even a more horrendous edition than Gross&#039;s.

We shall see in the near future when a certain &#039;persona&#039; will be publishing the works of Nathan of Gaza et al.
There still exists a herem on R. Kook and no one got excommunicated as far as I know.
In any event a herem has no place nor validity in a pluralistic society.]]></description>

I too wish that there were critical editions and scholarly
translations of Abulafia&#039;s works. There has been only one true
critical edition of Abulafia major works: Shimon Levy&#039;s 1955 edition
of &quot;Chayei HaNefesh&quot; extant in a single copy at the Scholem
collection.
Please understand that Amnon Gross is a one-man operation
working without pay and at great personal cost. He told me that he was
in a great hurry to get the texts published before he got a herem
slapped on him in Mea Shearim. He does have the highest respect for
Abulafia&#039;s texts and goes to great lengths to apologize for his
mistakes in his introductions. So I would not fault Amnon Gross for
sloppiness or negligence when he has tried all alone at great risk to bring a
difficult body of work to a wider audience. 
Hopefully the interest generated by Gross&#039;s publications will lead to sponsorship/funding of critical editions and translations from within the academic establishment (which has disappointed on an astonishing scale in this fundamental regard).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Take into consideration the following: Gross had no knowledge of the Abulafian mss. nor an inkling of academic objectivity. He did not compare mss. when more than one mss. does exist and thus did not record diff in recensions. He did not even mention which mss. he used in each of his publications.
His edition abounds in errors plus his own surreptitiously added &#039;perceptions&#039;{sic} .
Another example of his non-objectivity is the fact that on the two vols. which are commentaries to the Guide he does not mention the Guide as I was told this was the advice he was given from his Breslov rabbi.
All in all it may be a good thing that it is out in a printed edition but IMO it is as if adding a veil to the whole corpus.
Caveat emptor!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rav Yehudah&#039;s response - what does all this seeing lights and meditation do for haKadosh Baruchu and the Sechinah? 
The true purpose of kabbalah isn&#039;t to be entertained by meditative moments and feeling special, wow, by having drawn so close to Hashem, but it is that thru the kavanot we give ohr and power to haKadosh Baruchu. Everyone else prays and asks for something (as does this technique) but the kavanot actually give HaKadosh Baruchu Ohr. And by accessing this ohr, we bring Jewish neshamot and the Geulah eventually (and in short).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In couple of months I am travelling to Malta, where my main interest is to look for hypothetical place on Comino, where Abulafia ztz&quot;l spend last years of his life. Clues indicate limestone caves in the eastern part of the cliff coast of Comino. Actually, wouldn&#039;t be beautiful to find his grave, collect minyan and say kadish? Wasn&#039;t it the worst thing that actually happened that Abulafia - with all the otzar he gave to the next generations - died in an unknown place, most probably even without proper halvaya...

Funny you should mention that.  I just read one of Huss&#039; articles &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/23722709/Boaz-Huss-The-Foramtion-of-Jewish-Mysticism-and-Its-Impact-on-contemporary-Kabbalah&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Formation of Jewish Mysticism...&lt;/a&gt;, where he discusses the modern Abulafia revival including Amnon Gross&#039; edition.  While searching on Amnon Gross, I came across an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/details/AmnonGrossInterview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interview from 2010&lt;/a&gt;.

in the course of my own research i stumbled on here (again), and thought maybe you would be interested to know that i was just last week in a evening workshop in tel-aviv given by Gross on Abulafian meditation. It was actually quite tiring. Gross, as i know already from meeting him (wrote about it here: http://tomerpersico.com/2010/08/03/abulafia__gross/ ), takes A&#039;s instructions very seriously, so that the meditation he teaches is very tedious and long. every letter of every holy name get pronounced with a long breath and head movement. it takes a lot of practice, memory and patience to do it right, as he himself says. i can&#039;t imagine too many people adopting this path.]]></description>
