					<description><![CDATA[I think it is important to note the ability for a term to facilitate the contours of a inchoate socio-cultural trend as opposed to merely seeing &#039;post-orthodoxy&#039; as a term added on to a pre-semantic socio-cultural entity (in an Ian Hackings and Arnold Davidson sense). In other words, why are some people who grew up orthodox identifying as &#039;independent&#039; (as per many people in Hadar or non-egal minyanim that dont affiliate with a  denomination) while others as post-orthodox. My sense from the ground is that &#039;post-orthodox&#039; is a term used by folks who are already settled (marred, single...) in an orthodox community-shul but feel themselves slightly alienated, and hence can employ the term post-orthodox to remain situated in their community while given their sense of otherness an objectified label. The degree then that &#039;post-orthodox&#039; precludes the wider cultural extensions and structural innovations found in &#039;independent&#039; contexts since most persons identifying as such are predominately (and here of course mirco-cultures, hybrid cultures, internet all complicate things) embedded in orthodox social structures (minyan, day school, artscroll...) should be significantly noted. B&#039;kitzur: I would be very surprised if in the next few years a shul or school identified itself as post-orthodox, given my above thoughts. 
[These comments may be slightly off-topic in regards to Stern since he seems to be referring to &#039;post-orthodox&#039; as a second tier anthropological term that designates a historical shift rather than a circulated identity used by people today.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that 1985 may be the key year for emergence of these trends.
It was in this year that JTS ordained its first female rabbi. The decision to do so was a direct response to the passing of Saul Leiberman. This event marks the transformation of Conservative Judaism into an egalitarian, essentialy post-Halachic (at least from an Orthodox perspective) movement that no longer really abutted Orthodoxy.

1985 is also the year that the REITS Rashei Yeshiva published their Teshuva on Women&#039;s Tefilah Groups. This marked the end of the era of Rav&#039;s halachic dominance in MO community. (The Rav, opposed womens Tefilah groups by this point, but also opposed the teshuva- his opinion had so little impact that it was not widely known until the Frimer publicized it many years later) This Teshuva also signaed that the younger generation of Rashei Yeshiva were not going to engage moderninity with the sophistication or sensitivity of the Rav. This left a sizable segment of the MO community disenfranchised from high level  rabbinic/halachic leadership. 

These two opposite pendulum swings left a vacuum between the Orthodox and Conservative worlds. It was  this vacuum that, Edah, JOFA, Drisha, YCT, R. Halivni in several of his incarnations, Mechon Hadar etc. have sought to fill. 

1985 is also around the time that  the Artscroll siddur began to make serious inroads into MO shuls. This would blur the line between the other elements of the MO and the Yeshivish world.]]></description>
