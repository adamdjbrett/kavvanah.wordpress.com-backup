The sacred can be seen in many layers of consumer culture and postmodern life. In the view of Durkheim, anything can become sacred, and as such, this includes commodities (Judaism knows this very well for obvious reasons). 

Within many Ultra-Orthodox communities, for instance, this is also a given. Although one may see Tuvia&#039;s Judaica, Kosher Castle, or the local Pathmark as purely commercial commodities, these have an especially sacred meaning within a community that does not have the synagogue-sermon-pastoral care model seen within most Modern Orthodox suburban communities and the sense of organized religion seen in communities where you go to a service at a set time that includes a sermon, in a synagogue featuring social, volunteer, educational, and pastoral services, with a rabbi trained in the nuances of management, pastoral psychology,  and other areas germane to the pulpit (in the seminary model). Rather, in the non-Modern Orthodox world, where you daven at any number of minyanim in any possible number of settings, commodities take on a sacred space as a socio-religiously-cohesive element in the community. I believe this is an example of Featherstone&#039;s premise that the sacred is able to sustain itself outside of the formal institutions of organized religion within the consumer culture that is almost emblematic of Haredi life within a community such as Monsey.]]></description>

I suspect that in spatial terms if suburbia is the all-encompassing profane, then the alternative is a return to sacred space.

People who make aliyah sometimes speak about seeking both an escape from America&#039;s relentless saturated consumerism and a desire to return to a holy place.

One notable thing about American consumer culture is that it can co-opt any symbol. As a result there is nothing left that is categorically sacred.  Even cemeteries are getting kitchy (not to mention crowded by strip malls). What is the Orthodox equivalent of &quot;put Christ back into Christmas&quot;-  &quot;Take the vacation out of Pesach&quot;?

I really don&#039;t have suggestions. The Logos became text, how does the text become Logos once more in forsaken world? There is a profound fear about talking too much about God after God stopped talking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that one need not look further than Monsey or North York as examples of this phenomenon. To use the language of Diamond, places such as the ubiquitous strip mall on Rt. 59 or Bathurst Street have become sacred space for these communities. Suburbia does carry on its own unique ideology, and I think that one can look at the popularity of the Prosperity Gospel within suburban evangelical churches as an example of this in the theological sense, while observing trends among the Orthodox such as Pesach in hotels or the Dominican Republic, kosher sushi and exotic cuisines, and other trends which tell a uniquely sociological religious tale of Orthodox amalgamation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AS-

 I think you got it by your use of the word ideology.

Karl Mannheim defined the term ideology in his 1929 Ideology and
Utopia as a worldview that determines the way we define a situation.
Ideology is considered a distortion of the original meaning, as a
false consciousness.  Implicit in this formulation was the ability to
somehow remove the distortions of ideology. Jacob Katz in his studies of 
Orthodoxy used ideology in this manner.
 (and by extension so do most bloggers- stick to 1929)

Clifford Geertz took issue with considering ideology as a distortion.
Rather, all ideology is embedded in a cultural construction that bears
the meaning, symbolism, and moral order of the society. Following this
approach, Robert Wuthnow shows how ideology creates situations where,
for example, Orthodox Jews and Evangelicals share a common ideological elements.
The ideology of suburbia shapes Muslims, Jews, and Christians.

Furthermore, Michel de Certeau point out how ideology is always
spatially located, and Antonio Gramsci and Pierre Bourdieu note that
our discussions of ideology separate living from thinking.

My post was a consideration of the spatial role of ideology- suburbia. 
Unlike the Katz framework of Reform –Orthodox, Left-Right. The ideology 
of suburbia is the overarching framework for all sides. But what are the alternatives?
Help me think this one through. 

Your comment from Scholem was also made by Rav Kook and Rosensweig, they all saw Rabbi S.R.Hirsch as content without form.  But each gave different answers. More importantly, I am not sure that their critique of 19th century bourgeois Judaism is the same as what is needed for suburban Judaism. 

On Mussar, I assume that you are referring to Andrew Heinzes’s book. On that I disagree. But that would be a future post. 

Jeff- Don’t ask me a question like that until I submit the manuscript of Volume II to Palgrave and submit my Maharal paper from this past summer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s amazing how much ideology is  invisibly conveyed via American consumerist culture.

On the other hand, what is the real critique? That American Orthodoxy is &quot;inauthentic?&quot; 

When Scholem characterized halakhic orthodoxy as a &quot;well ordered house&quot; was he not basically pointing out that it served to displace God from the discussion? Talk of God and revelation is disruptive and can have some potentially anarchic consequences.

Arguably this move toward the predominant available model of social stability is actually a conservative move. 

Also, note that the  American self-help ethos was exported to Judaism via the modern mussar movement long before the rise of contemporary suburban Judaism. Perhaps that&#039;s one reason it penetrated so effortlessly.]]></description>
