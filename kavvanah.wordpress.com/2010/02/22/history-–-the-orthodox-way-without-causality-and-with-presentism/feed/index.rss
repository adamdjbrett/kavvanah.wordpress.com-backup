					<description><![CDATA[You are correct; no matter how Christians may place the Holocaust into their eschatological view of things, their educational institutions nonetheless do ensure that in the secondary level, their students are competent in the humanities, social and physical sciences. Haredi institutions by their nature, purpose, and design do not share these goals. .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually first thought of this in general terms not Jewish ones.
Social science exists to teach certain skills. In the modern world, the lessons of 3rd and 4th grade are mastered but there is a breakdown between 10th and 11th grade. Many Christian and Jewish groups do not acquire the 11th grade skills of social science analysis.
So for Moshe&#039;s comment, there is a difference between those who did not master 11th grade and those who mastered it but choose not to use it, or those who only use causality that serves their needs.
The author&#039;s starting premise was that Christians she has worked with. Other studies have shown that even if they think Christianity is the answer to the Holocaust have mastered greater skills. meaning that even if they have moral arrogance, they may not have social isolation or a lack of complexity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One striking thing is that the Jewish community reinforces this sort of tactile personal feeling through history. On Passover we tell the wicked son that were he there at the Exodus, he would not have been redeemed, and b&#039;chol dor vodor chayov odom leeros es atzmo ki-eeloo hoo yotzo mee-mitzroyim. When I was growing up, the &quot;ki-eeloo&quot; part of that formulation was always de-emphasized. This approach even arises in our social media -- Saw You at Sinai, where matchmaking becomes codified as literal historical engagement. Or in children&#039;s holocaust literature, where in The Devil&#039;s Arithmetic the protagonist is literally transported to a camp to learn the true meaning of the Holocaust.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This raises the larger question of the status &quot;Jewish History&quot; with in the Orthodox curriculum, from Artscroll to Berel Wein to R. Rakeffet. How does these various writers and teachers ballance the conflicting methods and conclusions of modern academic historiography with those of  traditional Jewish narrative memory and theology?
I think the answers to these questions are more complex and varied than we often give credit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holocaust education within Haredi circles is viewed as theodicy, not within the context of the exact earthly political or sociological mechanisms by which Hitler was able to come to power.
The purpose of teaching Jewish history in the yeshiva day school is certainly not the same purpose for its teaching within the academy. The former does not exist to further any communal or spiritual aims, while the uniquely theological Jewish History courses within a yeshiva (assuming that they even exist) are intended to instill a sense of awe and an understanding of the nature of Divine providence. The teacher mentioned in that article failed to realize that there is no desire to have an understanding of secular knowledge (or even view it as sanctifiable a la Rav Kook) within Chabad or any other Haredi communities. Education serves a purely utilitarian function within those circles. The same is also probably true for the bulk of the Modern Orthodox, who do not become academics or professors, but who go to college in order to obtain good jobs law, medicine, business, etc.) To assume otherwise and to think that yeshivas and their products are going to be open to the academic study of Judaism on any level is naive and foolish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jewish day school education is precisely meant to instill &quot;moral simplicity, religious clarity, and, ultimately, social insularity.&quot; So it seems that Mrs. Glickman&#039;s Holocaust unit was quite successful. I am not being glib. The author seems shocked, shocked that this is what is being taught? That a parochial school has a parochial outlook? This is excoriation clothed as social science.  

That&#039;s not to deny that holding fast to the idea that the Jews transcend history makes one nearly incapable of apprehending the world rationally. But that&#039;s a critique that you could come to just by picking up a Berel Wein book. You didn&#039;t have to sit in on a girls high school class for that. 

[Incidentally, what is up with Lubavitchers as recurring subjects of social science research (at least three book length studies come to mind)? Do they have some explicit policy welcoming all sociologists? I seem to recall once meeting three NYU grad students in the course of a week or two all doing field work in Crown Heights.]]]></description>
