					<description><![CDATA[based on what you have said, how do we know that this is a move to a post Orthodox era and not simply a re-alignment of boundries that will soon enough set in.

					<description><![CDATA[One thing that this thesis has hit upon is the rapidity and punctuality of crisis in the past decade.

This is not just a product of new modes of communication. The destabilization of Orthodoxy certainly owes its origins to trends that have been taking shape since a stable orthodox identity formed including:

The growth of self-contained Hareidi communities and self-contained Modern Orthodox communities.

The inability to extricate American consumerist culture from American Popular culture leading to the inexorable penetration of American popular culture into all but the farthest reaches of Orthodoxy. 

The under appreciated influence of the ba&#039;al teshuva movement. (in effect, the importation of a crisis culture) 

The fact that current rabbinic-communal leaders do not share institutional and/or familial ties.

And contra Chakira I think that there is a growing apathy toward Zionism as an ideology that previously was used to demarcate intradenominational boundaries, now replaced with an overarching shared pragmatism toward Israel. Other issues are then needed to maintain these borderlines.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some other  factors of  post orthdoxy is the perceived triumph of Orthodoxy. Some now want to adopt what they perceive as the critical success factors of Orthodoxy- general high level of ritual of observance- yet they want the intellectual  freedom of the Conservative movement. 
Yet, at the same time the problem is that the Modern Orthodox establishment has little to offer to engage people from the above mentioned intellectual viewpoint.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There were many great posts this weekend, and I will not address all the important points made here. However, I wonder if the Post-Orthodox (Po-O?) discussion has omitted the antipathy to Zionism I find among many of my peers? It seems like MO assumed a strong Zionist bent that many people cannot get behind. I am surprised there has been less talk about this than seemingly smaller issues of doctrine or kashruth.]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;So you agree that at least at the leadership level, people were fighting identity battles and drawing boundaries for decades.&lt;/em&gt;

No I do not agree. The microphone case did not create boundaries, on the contrary it shows the lack of boundaries. The leadership was not having identity battles- there were real disagreements for the sake of heaven in which social demarcation was not demanded. Definitions of Orthodoxy were drawn 1948-1957 using Conservative as a foil, but once in place they stayed there for 50 years. And boundaries of Agudah, using MO as a foil, were drawn 1963-1965 and then stayed there.  
Laity in the 1960 did not pay attention because they were disinterested and hypo- critical, now the laity is hyper-critical.]]></description>

So you agree that at least at the leadership level, people were fighting identity battles and drawing boundaries for decades. One may then see the current situation as the successful outgrowth of the boundary drawing of the 1950s, with one important limitation. You document that hamon &#039;am did not truly feel that the boundaries were clearly demarcated. Today, even though many people bought into the successful rabbinically initiated identity politics of the past, there are a lot of people who still do not accept them, and today, with the very bottom up communications tools, such as blogs and email lists, these hamon &#039;am are becoming more visible and form informal groups and make their voice be heard. Fascinating, but somewhat less revolutionary than Stern would have us believe.]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;Was the defining boundary of the 1950s, M&#038;Ms (mechitza and microphone) all about strict interpretation of the letter of the law? There are enough responsa that show poskim being doubtful about this. See, for example, a recent post on Text &#038; Texture, about microphones on Shabbat. One possek talks of microphones as possibly not inherently prohibited, but muktza machmat mius dereformim.&lt;/em&gt;

No one said that and that is a different discussion. These debates were left to the Poskim. People did not label those who used microphones as heretics or violating rabbinic authority.People knew that most prohibited microphones, Baltimore had a grandfather clause to use them, and that out of town YU rabbis used them. But it did not create three groups or lead to accusations or social divisions. 
Even the collection of boundaries that separated Conservative and Orthodox were not taken seriously by most lay people as creating two groups.In fact, it was hard getting most lay people to take any of this seriously until the end of the 1970s. Once you were labeled as Orthodox, you were Orthodox. Internal division within Orthodoxy did not drive definitional divisions. even within a YI there would likely be 4-5 levels of kashrut. On one extreme  considered all dairy is kosher and used the non-shomer shabbt butcher and baker to the other side that drive out of its way to the bakery with a specific hekhsher. That is not true today.]]></description>

However, he is right about the role of a more grass-roots form of communication being at the root of a reexamination of boundaries. The internet has empowered the common man to make his voice heard, and suddenly kindred opinions join in debate and marginal amorphous groups gather more force than was ever conceivable before.

I very much like the definition:
&lt;em&gt;Post-Orthodoxy is a term for those drawn into the vortex of ever new controversies, those who feel an urgency to deal with them, and those who use them to help create new lines.&lt;/em&gt;

In that sense, Post Orthodoxy is an era, not a group; it describes the current state of Orthodoxy, and that description resonates with me.]]></description>
