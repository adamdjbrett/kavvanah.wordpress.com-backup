					<description><![CDATA[I hear you on that.  I think you are right, thank you for re-framing it for me.  Right now I am working on PhD application essays etc. so I am a bit bogged down.  I can definitely send you the PDFs (will do in a few hrs.).  I would love to do a guest posting on alexandrov and radical politics in orthodoxy in general, but I cant do it right now.  Thank you for the invite!  perhaps when I have my affairs a bit more settled I can get something on paper for you.  as for the articles, that too will have to wait b/c I would have to scan them to email them to you, which would take much longer than just popping them in a xerox machine and sending by snail mail.]]></description>

Once you start writing you will find many things and will offer a statement of what is not useful. It may excite someone to disagree.
About sharing the texts, you can send them to me and I can host them here.
Can I get a guest post from you on radical politics and Orthodoxy? or Alexandrov? or one of the articles?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been tossing around the idea of writing on him for some time.  I was initiallyl attracted to him because he seemed to present himself as an anarchist to rav kook (or at least sympathize with anarchism) and I am interested in the idea of radical left politics somehow coinciding with orthodoxy.  I still may, but, as i said, i think there are some very significant limitations to his theology and so whatever i would write would come out as more of a history of thought rather than a contribution to the present... which I am not sure I want to do.  I have several copies of various works of his in PDF form.  I also have copies of many of the newspaper articles I mentioned... i sifted through many years of the magid and some of hatzefira (though there are many more that should still be gone through).  I dont want to post my email publicly, but if you can think of a way that we can discreetly share contact info i would be happy to share what i have]]></description>

Kevin,
Are you working on him? Do you have more on him? Even if he seems a dead end, many people follow his route even if they do not write.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[several of alexandrov&#039;s works are available at hebrewbooks.org.  also, the second volume of mikhtavei mekhaker u-bikoret is at jnul.  it is currently unavailable for photocopying because it is actually still under copyright, but i have bee told it will expire in a year.  also, many articles written by him are available in the digitized versions of ha-tzefirah and ha-magid at jnul (though you must sift through the papers one by one as the search engine uncovers only a few of the many articles he wrote).  I think that part of the reason he was neglected is that he took the notion of the absolution of jewish law in messianic times quite literally and, while never outright recommending it, seems to suggest that this will occur naturally over a long period of time (i.e. not by divine intervention and sanction, but by progressive secularization).  This, combined with his implicit unitarianism leaves a judaism without any distinctive features: neither in practice nor in doctrine.  He left no room for judaism.  yet, his thought was so tied into its jewish framework (despite his drawing upon schelling and schopenhauer, whose thought he cited but ultimately added nothing to) that it also had little to offer the non-jewish world either.  I think that his story is an interesting one and that his attempt to give religious justification to the breakdown of religion may have been comforting to the rabbis of his generation despairing over that very dilemma.  However, it is ultimately a negative view, it does not offer a path through the destruction to some resurrection (e.g. like levinas does, incorporating atheism into the heart of his theistic discourse), he teaches only that the destruction is, somehow, ok.  So, no, i do not think alexandrov has much to offer us today.]]></description>
