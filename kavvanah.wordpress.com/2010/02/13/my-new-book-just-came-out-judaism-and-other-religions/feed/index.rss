					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of books, I just got your book &lt;i&gt;Thinking God&lt;/i&gt; off my shelf and am thinking of rereading it. It is almost 10 years old. What are your thoughts about it from your perspective today? Does it have anything to say as a counterpoint to the Suburban religion you discuss in a recent post?]]></description>

What would Bourdieu say about this AMZN suggestions convo? Its the dissipation of the non-subject at the center of taste, in favor of an interpassive taste-for-non-subjects.]]></description>

Thanks, if enough people order it then it might come down a few dollars. 
Since, I just ordered James Davidson Hunter, To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy, and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World, I get a very different list.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes I just don&#039;t understand people&#039;s decisions about which publisher to use - or are academic books also subject to the publisher&#039;s whim in accepting them?

E.g., Dov Schwartz&#039; book on the Rav&#039;s Ish haHalacha.  It was $25 at the Israel Bookshop in Brookline.  The Hebrew was a bit beyond me, so I figured I&#039;d wait for the English, but he published the translation with Brill, which costs $173 at Amazon.  Brill things are almost always expensive.  A bit beyond the range of the consumer, really only for specialists and libraries, I guess.  Surely with the wide interest in the Rav, there would have been plenty of market for a cheaper  translation in the States?]]></description>

This is the cheapest it is going to get. If you get it now and it comes down a few cents - you have a price guarantee until March 2 and free shipping. 
But in a few months the price will probably go up to over $60.
So this is the time to order it.  
I have an institutional order form for 20% off of the 85 list price.
For review copies, if you have reviewed before then you know that you have to go through the marketing department of Palgrave.]]></description>
