					<description><![CDATA[I think on a superficial level, people turn to Izbitz to justify their subversive conduct.  On a deeper level, people turn to Izbitz when they want to find peace amid the deep contradictions of life, or when they sense that reality is much more complicated and nuanced that they previosuly believed.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The more a person grasps the depths of Torah the more he sees that he was previously walking in darkness… Therefore, “do not make any hewn god” in order not to make the Torah into a habit. Hewn means cut, measured, and fixed — complete without any lack.&quot;

This reminds me of Nicholas of Cusa. Believing in one God means believing that you do not understand what you believe in or to whom you are praying.]]></description>
