					<description><![CDATA[rivka schatz uffenheimer, in her chapter on habad as anti-spiritualism in her HASIDISM AS MYSTICISM already showed how an embrace of the world is in the earliest strands of Habad thinking.
Also, the reversal of the body over the spirit is a  major theme in wolfson&#039;s new book OPEN SECRET, in which he reads many strands from 
&quot;The Rebbe&quot; back into the Alter (Rebbe).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mordy-The Rebbe Rashab removed the original ascetic dualism, the Rebbe RMMS was always commenting on how America is different, your grandparents wore rags, lived in a shack, and ate one meal a day.  The evangelical angle is interesting to understand the last twenty years.

Elavating sparks and doing a yihud while eating is a means of overcoming the opposing physicality.
Shivti Hashem Lenegdi Tamid- is to place God in opposition to the physical continuously. Most only quote the first half. 
R. Yosef Karo was quite puritanical, for example he fasted on Rosh Hashanah. 

Amanda Porterfeld points out that our renewed interest in the body leads to both yoga and asceticism, foodies and fasting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting to note this ascetic trend in early Hasidism.  I had heard about avodah begashmiyyut in the early generations of Hasidism, that one should eat/drink and thus elevate the sparks (is this avodat habirurim?), from which the practice of shirayim came about, and how this was regarded (at least by opponents) as a rejection of Mitnagdic asceticism.

Now I look into Elior&#039;s article on Hasidic ideas arising from Maggid Meisharim by the Mechaber, (http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~mselio/elior-85.pdf) and I see more of a tension between the physical and spiritual.  The bit you quote from Prof. Loewenthal sounds more like the avodah begashmiyyut that Elior brings from Tzavaat haRivash and Maggid Meisharim - that one should eat, but contemplate mishnayot (Karo) or the order of creation (Besht) while doing so, so as to devote one&#039;s entire act of eating to God, rather than to any kind of personal pleasure.

Seems like an ascetic mode of eating, as it were - resolving a tension between the ascetic tendency and the recognition, and sanctification of, the physical.]]></description>
