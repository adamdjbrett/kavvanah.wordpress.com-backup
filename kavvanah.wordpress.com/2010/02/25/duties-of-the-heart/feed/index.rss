Kiymu v&#039;kiblu.

At Sinai we were coerced into accepting the external practices but on Purim when the Amalakite force separating us from the light is destroyed we joyfully accept the Torah of our own free will.  

On Purim exoteric and esoteric expression are harmonized.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Johnson loses me in his description of Judaism as not having this tension because we Jews follow the heikhalot texts, Ashkenaz pietism, kabbalah, and ecstatic Hasidim. Anyone know a Jewish community that fits his description?  Anyone know where we can return to follow Eleazar of Worms quest for the Divine will? Anyone teaching Heikhalot when they teach Mishnayot?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I am also still looking for such a place, but while I feel too ignorant regarding other religions&#039; practices in this regard, we can point to this conflict having played out repeatedly in Judaism, culminating with the Sabbatean antinomianism and expressing itself partly in the later conflict between Chassidim and Mitnagdim.

While most observant Jews know relatively little of the esoteric, few are as exoteric-only as Yeshayahu Leibowitz. Most Orthodox Jews take it for granted that there is a need for an interplay between the exoteric and the esoteric. So Johnson overreached when he referred to Heikhalot and Chassidei Ashkenaz, but he could have referred to Chassidism, including but not limited to Chabad and Tanya, as well as Lurianic Sefardim, the Lithuanian use of Torah Lishmah as a religious experience, and kavvana orientation in general. Interlinear siddurim, both in English and Hebrew (commentary), only exist because people care not only about the motions, but also about the content.

I would say that Judaism recognizes and values the position of the esoteric, but disagrees with his evaluation of the exoteric: the exoteric is seen as the basis on which one may build the esoteric experience. We don&#039;t take such a dim view of a measure of social control.]]></description>
