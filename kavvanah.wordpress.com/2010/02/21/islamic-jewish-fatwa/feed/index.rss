					<description><![CDATA[I find that debate and the predestination theories of that time interesting but just as much as the world in Andalousi Grenada that spawned the likes of Abu Said Faraj ibn Lubb al Shatibi also stimulated the great philosopical ages that not only encouraged in sciences and philosphy but also a very differing view not supporting presestination.

Ibn-Sina, though noted more for his part in medicine was very much a strict believer of &quot;Qur&#039;an only&quot; and was often at conflict with clerics because of his constant stating that the haddiths were &quot;written by man&quot;.   I wonder if he was at that meating with al Shatibi what third view would have taken place!]]></description>

While both of your answers apply, I think it may be an inverted Agamben. God and heaven are so good and this world is so false, that we assign people to the messianic age. 
E R Goodenough dealt with the predestination in his Psychology of Religious Experience (1965), that I read a long time ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is restricting it to the elite an attempt to split the difference? Or is it a working-out of older tropes (at least in our religion, cannot speak for calvinists) regarding tzadikaya and their unique rapport with providence?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Giorgio Agamben notes that the Asharite theory of predestination led to the assignation of prisoners in concentration camps who gave up on life as Musselmanner (Muslims) because of the passivity inherent in this line of thought. 
For me the irony lies in the calcification of the image of retribution. Eventually we make hell so bad and god so overbearing that they take on a lapidary or transposable quality. When this happens we begin to assign others to hell, almost as a bracketing of their eventual fate, actions etc. Then we are left with a great deal of latitude in how to deal with this worldly relations with the hellbound sinners who will burn in the lake of fire.  To me the argument recalls Hegel&#039;s &quot;inverted world&quot; with deterministic religion as a stand in for deterministic scientism. The point being that both can lead to a self legislating subject.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not shocked at the notion that people can be predestined to Hell, but then again I am used to Calvinist thinking. Calvinism often did translate into philo-Semitism. If the Jews do not accept Jesus then it is not because they are willfully Satanic, just that they have not been given grace and are hell bound sinners like everyone else.]]></description>
