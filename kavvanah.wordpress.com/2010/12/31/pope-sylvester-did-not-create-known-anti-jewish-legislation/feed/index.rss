Thanks, I will send the demographic stuff later in the week.
I did not comment on the the Julius Caesar material because it was just so ridiculous. They write without any sources. We are not talking academics vs Artscroll or new compared to old, rather the things they write have no basis anywhere.
As a side point, an example of old vs new -you #2 is currently questioned by scholars- they think that Jews were not expelled from Jerusalem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a frum statistician. While demographics are outside of my particular specialties, I&#039;d be happy to take a look at those claims if you send them to me.

Also, I sent an email to the simpletoremember site listing additional historical inaccuracies with the Sylvester article, among them:

(1) There is no record of Julius Caesar having ordered a massacre of Jews; to the contrary, his policies towards Jews were quite favorable. For example, he exempted Jews from taxes during the shemitah yrear. There WAS a massacre of Jews by Romans at Mount Tabor some years befor 46 BCE, but (1) it was a disastrous military defeat, not a massacre of civilians, (2) like many of the conflicts of that time, it was one group of Je...ws calling in the Romans to act against another group of Jews, (3) Julius Caesar, whose policies toward Jews were generally favorable, was nowhere near the battle (he was probably committing genocide in Gaul).
 
(2) Jews had been expelled from Jerusalem hundreds of years prior to Sylvester (by Hadrian after the Bar Kochba revolt).
 
(3) The Roman capital had been moved to Milan by Diocletian prior to Sylvester&#039;s becoming Bishop of Rome.
 
(4) Sylvester did not attend the Council of Nicaea.
 
They asked me for sources! They should have researched the sources themselves!!!]]></description>
