					<description><![CDATA[Pretty interesting.  I don&#039;t see any new stimulus in these parts, but know there is a lot of growth in Texas with new communities popping up and thriving.  I agree that whoever gets there first sets the tone.  

In St. Louis there were no divisions until some decided to form an Agudas Israel synagogue in the late 80&#039;s.  They hired a very dynamic young Rabbi and started a kollel, but the real division occured several years alter when a cheder and Bais Yaakov were started which competed with the existing Centrist day school.  I would say that was the real trigger.  Also around that time the first Aish in the country was started here, which was very successful and fed into the kollel and Agudah.  Since then the kollel has expanded and done a lot of kiruv work which has expanded the haredi schools and shul, both of which are now larger and younger than the Young Israel shul.]]></description>
