				<p>Here is a history of how to spell קבלה. Notice the changes of the spelling and recent vintage of our current spelling of kabbalah. Most spell checks still use cabala. It seems that the publication of the Encyclopedia Judaica in 1971-2 changed the spelling to kabbalah. What other words did the EJ change? Qabbalah has still not caught on and cabbala has declined. Also notice the interest in the esotericism of the cabbala as a subject between 1810-1840. Click on the chart to enlarge.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/sichot71/12-71vayechi-asara.htm">VBM just translated</a> one of the important interviews with Rav Amital. The Hebrew original was done in 2007 for Yad Vashem.</p>
<p>Here are some selections,<a href="http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/sichot71/12-71vayechi-asara.htm"> the full version is here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Religious Life During the Holocaust and After: An Interview with Rabbi Yehuda Amital</strong></p>
<p>On Yom Kippur eve we received orders to go back..<br />
 Meanwhile the shooting was intensifying, to the point where the German soldiers guarding us ran away, because they were afraid that the Russians would capture them. And so we remained behind, and we got to the Jewish Community building, to the building where I had lived with my parents. We entered the cellar on Yom Kippur eve. We prayed on Yom Kippur in the dark. We had one machzor with us; one person read the prayers aloud, and thus we prayed with a minyan.</p>
<p><strong> My whole concept of prayer comes from there. </strong>I saw people – fathers of children, men who had wives – they were alone, knowing that their families had been taken, but they didn’t know to where. And I said to myself, “How is it possible to pray?” We knew before then that the foundation of prayer is gratitude towards God. I said, “What gratitude? People are sitting here without parents, without children.” So I reached the conclusion – which I published later on – that service of God cannot be based on gratitude; there is something beyond that. “Though He slays me, I shall trust in Him” (Iyov 13:15). That is a higher level. That understanding was strongly imprinted in me then.<br />
<strong><br />
Did you have religious crisis points?</strong><br />
 I can’t speak of crisis points. One lives in crises all the time. For me, every festival is problematic. On Simchat Torah, for example, I would speak at the yeshiva about the Holocaust [because it was the day of my liberation]; I couldn’t let Simchat Torah go by without mentioning the Holocaust. I spoke about it all the time. Every eve of Tish’a be-Av I spoke about it at the yeshiva; the subject occupied me.</p>
<p><strong>Did it also affect your attitude towards prayer?</strong><br />
On the contrary – as Rabbi Yehuda ha-Levi said, “I flee from You – to You.” I have no other option. I need God; without that I’m not able to exist at all. Without this faith I lose everything. But it’s not as people think, that when a Jew is religious then all the problems are solved. There’s no such thing. But I need His closeness. Just as a person cannot be alone, he seeks some intimacy, some anchor. For me, faith in God is that strong anchor.<br />
<strong><br />
What, as you see it, is the place of the Holocaust in our religious world today?</strong><br />
Sometimes I encounter strange phenomena. They interview a religious person who says, “Why were some children killed there in a traffic accident? Because they didn’t observe Shabbat.” I said to him, “Okay, so you have an explanation for that, but why were millions of Jewish children killed? For that you have no explanation. So why are you trying to give a religious explanation? Be quiet.” It upsets me, but what can I do? Sometimes I keep silent.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe that we have more of a moral obligation than other nations, in the wake of the Holocaust?</strong><br />
I believe that it demands of us greater morality, greater attention to others.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>One of the most important books of Jewish thought in 2008 was <strong>Benjamin Lazier. God Interrupted: Heresy and the European Imagination between the World Wars. Princeton University Press, </strong> (I unfortunately have had it out from the library since early 2009 and they are finally recalling it. This core of this post was actually written ages ago).  It deals with how three Jewish thinkers- Scholem, Jonas, Strauss- dealt with the loss of tradition. They wanted to avoid relativism and instead choose human value through pantheism, gnosticism, neo-platonism, and neo-aristotelianiism.</p>
<p>Why is this high brow book relevant? Why read this long blog post? The reason is the tension between physis and nomos and between relativism and ethical meaning. In 1975, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein wrote his classic &#8220;Is there an ethic outside of halakhah.&#8221; Many have not paid enough attention to the opening second paragraph where Lichtenstein reclaims the tradition by claiming that we care about nomos, not physis, law not the natural order. In turn, the Reform theologian Rabbi Eugene Borowitz complained about the counter-cultural centurions at the door and wrote that Reform needs its own ethical moment within nomos. Most of the recent discussions, therefore, in all three movements have been about nomos, for example medical ethics is done as a legal question.</p>
<p>Now, this year the hot book is Arthur Green&#8217;s <em>Radical Judaism</em> with its defense of pantheism. Most of the criticism of the book has been sociological or the invoking of nomos against Green&#8217;s physis. However, if there is going to be a serious response, then it must directly tackle the current quest for physis. The response must directly deal with the issues of those who feel that nomos is not the answer. One can either find a new defense of nomos for the next generation or find a more traditional form of physis. Saadyah, Bahye, Cordovero and Rav Kook among many others are all physis in that their Judaism is part of the natural order. Should one use one of those for a theology? Alternately, one of the followers of Hans Jonas is Jewish thinker Leon Kass, who rejects stem cell research as an affront to the natural order. Are people looking to become natural in that the law has turned out to not offer ethics? or should one respond to Green with Neo-Aristotelianism, or with Levinas? People want to look into their hearts, not to nomos, where the &#8220;deepest depths&#8221; are to be treated as the holiest. </p>
<p>I did not post Lazier to discuss the implications for Green, rather because it offers one of the best expositions and casuistry of the current issues about formulating theology today. My Catholic colleagues are all gaga about the work of the <a href="http://theology.nd.edu/people/all/oregan-cyril/index.shtml">Notra Dame theologian Cyril O&#8217; Regan,</a> one of the leading theologians in the US today, who is writing a massive many volume exposition of modern gnosticism, heresy, and pantheism- in order to come out with a committed Catholic theology at the end. (I already have a draft of a future post on O&#8217;Regan.)Lazier&#8217;s book provides one of the basic interfaces between the Jewish heresies and the potential for a response. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=24106">The Paradoxes of Secular Heresy</a> by Anna Yeatman<br />
In this wonderful, erudite, and beautifully written book, Benjamin Lazier suggests that the legitimation problem of human artifice assumed a particular urgency and topography in the period between the world wars.  His focus is especially on how three Jewish thinkers&#8211;<strong>Hans Jonas, Leo Strauss, and Gershom Scholem</strong>&#8211;responded to what their contemporary Arendt recognized as the context for Walter Benjamin’s work, <strong>the irreparable loss of authority for tradition,</strong> None of these thinkers wanted to reinstate orthodox Judaism; they could not avoid the modern freedom for human artifice, but they rejected a nihilist-existentialist celebration of the will&#8211;in the absence of God, the human subject is free to will its own being.  They rejected this conclusion because it affirms an utter contingency or arbitrariness.  Such freedom is without any normative orientation or restraint.  It is as though the human subject arrogates to itself a divine creative power without the infinity or universality that is the divine. </p>
<p>In his own way, each of these thinkers insisted that it is vital that the human freedom for artifice not be mistaken as a freedom for self-creation.  To make this insistence, each had to engage and learn from the two heresies of Gnosticism and pantheism that attend the development of the idea of a freedom for human artifice.  These heresies are not new, but in the modern context they acquire the force of being the only possible intellectually cogent narratives of the divine.  In Gnosticism, as already indicated, the divine is invoked in its absence from the world that humans have made, a world of destruction and sin.  In pantheism, the divine is invoked as it inheres within worldly being.  The problem with both heresies is that they are antagonistic to the world&#8211;Gnosticism by indicating the world as derelict in relation to the divine, and pantheism by conflating the divine with the world, thus robbing the world of its own distinctive being.  Jonas offered a philosophical biology, a neo-Aristotelian account of the world as a living organism, as purposive nature.  In so doing, he deliberately presented an alternative to the will to power, a normative reference point in ecology.  Strauss offered a different conception of nature as a normative reference point for human artifice&#8211;this is a neo-Platonic conception of natural right, a conception of justice that precedes human artifice.  Of the three, Scholem was most attracted to a nihilist celebration of a Jewish Zarathustra, a worldly messianism that, like pantheism, conflates human and divine creation.  </p>
<p>However, he argued that “Nietzsche’s famous cry ‘God is dead,’ should have gone up first in a Kabbalistic text warning against the making of a Golem and linking the death of God to the realization of the idea of the Golem” (p. 194).  The myth of the Golem, of course, is a story of the human arrogation of the divine power to create turning into a force for destruction of human beings and their world.  Scholem recognized in Zionist messianism a contemporary Golem, and he argued against it, the tragedy as is now so clear of modern Israel.  </p>
<p>For Lazier, God cannot disappear, for the modern sensibility continues to dwell with and in God, albeit heretically.<br />

<p><strong><br />
Here is another great review</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/exegesis/the-heretical-imperative">The Heretical Imperative by James Chappel</a></p>
<p> “Church Going,” a 1955 poem by Philip Larkin, describes the mix of awkwardness and reverence many of us feel when faced with the monuments of our religious past. The narrator, having removed his cycle clips to visit an old church, asks himself why he continues these debased pilgrimages, which “always end at a loss like this, wondering what to look for.” Larkin’s tourist is unwilling to embrace the rigidities of strict atheism or strict orthodoxy, and lives somewhere in the murky space between the two.</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem is the one diagnosed by Hannah Arendt: the collapse of orthodox religion has not caused us to turn towards the world with the piety and love once accorded God. Benjamin Lazier, in his inspiring and beautifully-written God, Interrupted: Heresy and the European Imagination Between the World Wars (Princeton, 2009), suggests that there can be no simple path between these two forms of reverence. A detour through the long tradition of heresy might be required in order to overcome religion without losing our faith. Through a study of the surprising influence of heretical thought on Hans Jonas, Leo Strauss, and Gershom Scholem—three of the most influential Jewish intellectuals of the twentieth century—Lazier attempts to resuscitate the lost art of heresy, with all its possibilities and danger.</p>
<p>Although European societies were obsessed for centuries with the identification and persecution of heretics, Gnosticism and pantheism refused to die (however many actual heretics were forced to)&#8230;In the tumult of interwar Europe, many attempted to reclaim this absent God through heresy: both Gnosticism and pantheism, the twin rivals of a discredited orthodoxy, reappeared and flourished. Jonas, Strauss, and Scholem, all of whom came to maturity in this postwar period, were indelibly marked by this revival. </p>
<p>Both Jonas and Strauss argued that the horrors of modernity stemmed from God’s disappearance. Against the Gnostics and pantheists, whom they relentlessly attacked, the two German Jews held that the world left behind could be reinvested with the transcendent value that used to be God’s alone. Modernity, in other words, could only be redeemed by filling the God-shaped hole in our society with nature. <strong>In Aristotelian terms, they see physis as an antidote to nomos.</strong> We need, that is, to understand nature differently: not merely as “that which surrounds us,” but as a metaphysical and ethical order that sets limits to human activity—limits that we are manifestly incapable of setting for ourselves.</p>
<p>For Jonas, the modern worldview was tainted with Gnosticism: we treat the earth, and one another, with such consummate lack of care because, in the absence of God, living things appear to us as mere matter to be used and abused at our convenience. Once we stop seeing nature as a stage for God’s creation, and God’s order, everything is permitted (to quote another famous heretic). From this insight he developed a robust philosophical biology and environmental ethics, premised on the final overcoming of the Gnostic heresy. </p>
<p>When we encounter the world, Scholem suggests, we are not faced with the bare nothing of the Gnostics or the flaccid everything of the pantheists; instead, we are faced with a unique something that is autonomous from God yet shot through with traces of its divine origin. Only a gap between God and world allows us the space to develop autonomously as ethical subjects, but this gap is not absolute: from our all-too-human standpoint, we can still sense God, and we can still glimpse redemption.</p>
<p>it shows us an alternative to strict orthodoxy that does not take the form of shrugging ecumenism. Lazier, it should be clear, is not attempting to found a new orthodoxy. Instead he is unearthing a style of thought and reasoning&#8230;  <strong>This mode of engagement with the religious past replaces confused half-belief with exacting analysis, shaping the shards of exploded traditions into something new instead of leaving them in a mess on the floor</strong>. If the God of orthodoxy has lost his plausibility for many of us—for two-thirds of us, apparently—heretical reasoning allows us a path to piety that does not circle back to a bankrupted past.</p>
<p>To adopt Lazier’s title, the modern predicament is one in which God’s call is “interrupted.” The orthodox solution to this dilemma is to act as though she can still hear the word of God with complete clarity, while the atheist’s solution is to clap her ears against the ever-quieter echoes of past revelation. <strong>The Jewish intellectuals discussed by Lazier present us with a third option: to open our ears to nature, and to one another. The skeptic would argue that a circuitous route through heresy is hardly necessary to arrive at such a banal conclusion; in response, Lazier’s modern heretics would wonder why such a simple resolution was ignored in the tragedies of the twentieth century.</strong> As Scholem put it in a devastating formulation, whose simplicity belies the heretical complexity required to truly defend it: “Develop peacefully, and don’t destroy the world.” <a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/exegesis/the-heretical-imperative">Read the rest here.</a></p></blockquote>

				<p>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888), the important German rabbi, during his time officiating as Chief Rabbi of Oldenberg he published <em>Horeb </em>in 1838, his catechism and definition of Judaism. Help me think through the quote below from Hirsch. Any Rabbinic sources come to mind? I know he wrote statements in Frankfort that differ with these views, but right now I want to help analyze this passage. Anything sound familiar? Anyone develop it further? Thoughts? </p>
<p>Rabbi Hirsch defines idolatry as considering the natural world as separate than God. The world is filled with natural forces and the forces within man, some seen some unseen. One should appreciate that there is a Divine law of nature and God’s providence for human destiny. Human’s are given moral freedom, which can triumph over the tyranny of ruthless power or the bondage to the passions.  Your moral freedom as a gift of God and one must use to it to subordinate to God’s laws for humanity. </p>
<p>The quests for wealth, power, and knowledge are all forms of idolatry in that one does not subject one’s forces to a higher purpose. Idolatry, the treating of anything besides God as absolute, consists of a loss of human dignity not an intellectual mistake. One must beware the idolatrous human bondage of sensuality. Polytheism is thinking you do not have to follow God’s duty and instead one can follow the passions For Rabbi Hirsch, seeing the world as many forces or gods is polytheism, which is avodah zarah.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Rabbi Hirsch portrays the idolatry of Egypt as sensuality, as slavery without freedom, and as the power of mammon and the state. Roman is portrayed as the idolatrous brutality of the state and militarism. </p>
<p>Originally, idolatry meant a false god or a representation of God or gods. From the 17th century onward idolatry moved from its original reference to icons to false attitudes toward life. Most of time, the major forms of polytheism were materialism,  the world of commerce, and sexuality. Henry Moore, the Cambridge Neoplatonist defined idolatry as  polytheism, the multiplicity of sensuality and materialism. According to Voltaire idolatry never happened but there is the polytheism of superstition.  </p>
<p>In the 19th century Wiemar Classicism, polytheism was the worship of nature or man himself and not the higher duties. Schiller&#8217;s <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em> (1795) warns against imagination and sensuality. Man should use his freedom and take charge of his destiny. Already in Schiller’s early <em>Mission of Moses</em> (1789) was “Reason’s victory over those coarser errors assured, and the ideas about the Supreme Being necessarily ennobled. The idea of a universal connection among things must lead necessarily to the conception of a single, Supreme Understanding.”</p>
<p>Here is the definition from Horeb.</p>
<p><em>Both minuth and zenuth lead to idolatry – riotous enjoyment leads to it directly; denial and misrepresentation of God usually over the bridge of pleasure.<br />
And if then, in the embrace of sensuality, you have stripped yourself of everything spiritual, no longer retaining any feeling for the Divine, you will yourself become aware in your impulses of your feebleness, your instability, your inconstancy in pleasure, and you will fall prostrate before every creature that provides you with enjoyment and itself seems to you so noble and so everlasting in its enjoyment.<br />
You can also reach idolatry, or rather polytheism, directly through the eye and the understanding of the senses, if Torah does not reveal to you the One and Only God; for with your physical eye and understanding you behold only particular beings and activities, but not the Invisible One with his dominating law. You see only gods, not God. This is avodah zarah.  </p>
<p>You see on every side active forces and their carriers in Nature, elements and carriers of elements like the sun and the earth and the sea and the air; in the life of peoples, you see Nature, soil, rivers, mountains, and so forth; you see Nature, under the hands of man, raised to a power, and you see men with their wisdom and foolishness, power and weakness, passion and folly, fashioning, destroying and influencing the fate and the life of peoples; and an unseen force that holds sway over destiny and life. And in your own life you see the spiritual and the animal in you; you see yourself as a creative force, bestowing a blessing or a curse on everything around you.  </p>
<p>But nothing of all this exists or acts by its own power or its own will. Nothing of all this is a god; all of it is created, the servant of the One all-ruling and omnipresent God. In Nature you see God’s law hold sway; in the life of peoples God’s providence supreme; in yourself a strength sent from God. You yourself, as far as your body in concerned, are subject to the laws of Nature. You enjoy your moral freedom only as a free and loving gift of the Omnipotent, and with that freedom of will you are called upon to subordinate yourself to the universal law as God’s first servant. That much you have learnt. </p>
<p>What you have learnt, however…you must recognize nothing as God apart from this universal sway of God: ‘you shall have nothing alongside his omnipresent and all-pervading dominion.’.</p>
<p>Beware lest, instead of building your material life of God alone, you base it on wealth or power or knowledge or cunning or the like. If you do any of these things, you sin against the law: ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.’ </p>
<p>Nor is this idolatry merely an error, a mistaking of falsehood for truth. In that case, it would be simply an intellectual mistake, a delusion, deplorable indeed, but, even at the worst, not the worst that might happen….But this is not the case. As soon as you set anything else beside God as God, and still more as your God, forthwith human dignity, purity and uprightness fall to the ground, the fabric of your life goes to pieces.  </em></p>
<p>The only people who still speak like this are those influenced by Marxism: Erich Fromm (he was also a Hirschian) Herbert Marcuse, or Cornell West. Old time Christian Fundamentalists and left wing Muslim Marxists also speak like Rabbi Hirsch. Centrist Orthodoxy seemingly accepts the many gods of mammon, hedonism, militarism, degrees, self-fulfillment, and the professional drive to succeed.   </p>

				<p>After John Lennon was killed in 1980, there was a massive public mourning in Central Park. All Tuesday and Wednesday there was an immense gathering in the park of people crying, wailing and flailing over Lennon’s death. </p>
<p>That Wednesday night, Rav Soloveitchik gave a weekly parashah shiur in Furst 501.  The topic was the deaths of Jacob and Joseph in Egypt.<br />
Rav Soloveitchik set up the Biblical verses to discuss the topic of the mourning laws, in which he emphasized how the Egyptian mourning practices of embalming and the encrypting process was not permitted according to teachings of the halakhah. </p>
<p>He then said: “This [the Egyptian practice] is a case of going to extreme in mourning just like the people are now doing for John Lennon.” In the audience, this elicited an outburst of chuckles, murmuring, and moving chairs closer. When everything quieted down, he continued:</p>
<p>“How do I know from Lennon? You are surprised I know from Lennon. Well, I know Lenin- no one can forget Vladimir Lenin, he was a real troublemaker.[last two words slightly garbled from the murmuring crowd]  So I know about Lennon.”</p>
<p>Rav Soloveitchik followed this by using Jackie Onassis [Kennedy] as the model of the opposite extreme of callousness when after Kennedy was shot she shopped for a hat to wear during mourning .</p>
<p>Chabad and Paul McCartney<br />
Since we are speaking about Beatles: The surprise guest at last night’s fundraiser for Rutgers Chabad in New Brunswick was Sir Paul McCartney, who’s apparently dating the daughter of the one of the honorees. h/t <a href="http://njjewishnews.com/justASC/2010/12/08/ladies-and-shluchim-the-beatles/">JustASC</a> and <a href="http://njjewishnews.com/justASC/2010/12/08/i-cant-beleive-it-paul-mccartney/">more details here.</a></p>

				<p>Joshua Berman of Bar Ilan University/Shalem Center spoke at Davar in Teaneck two weeks ago.  He discussed his new project of reassessing Biblical source criticism from an academic and Jewish perspective. When I probed him, he was nice enough to agree to answer a few bigger questions. Now we can return the favor and help him produce a better book by offering comments on his proposed project.</p>
<p>Berman attended Princeton University, and holds a doctorate in Bible from Bar-Ilan University. He studied at Yeshivat Har Etzion and received his ordination from the Chief Rabbinate. His prior book is <a href="http://www.createdequalthebook.com"><em>Created Equal: How the Bible Broke with Ancient Political Thought</em></a> .  Go read it. It has gotten favorable reviews and even those who criticize parts of the book have been extremely charitable. It claims that the Pentateuch is history’s first blueprint for a society where theology, politics, and economics embrace egalitarian ideals, by reconstituting ancient norms and institutions. <em>Created Equal</em> is a popular work that used much of the current scholarly literature comparing ancient Near Eastern religion and Israelite religion, including those of Norman K. Gottwald who blurbed the book.</p>
<p>Berman’s new project is to respond, in some way, to Biblical source criticism as it is found today. He acknowledges that the traditional documentary hypothesis has been heavily modified and one should not set up a straw man to refute. He also directly refers to new approaches such as the supplemental model. He freely volunteers his affinity for Evangelical authors like Kenneth Kitchen, <a href="http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/how_reliable_is_exodus.htm">Alan Millard,</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Old-Testament-Guide-Pentateuch/dp/0830825517">Gordon Wenham</a> (all in the UK, and all emeritus), and in the US, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Israelite-Religions-Archaeological-Biblical-Survey/dp/0801027179">Richard Hess</a>. But which version of the supplemental model is forefront in his mind is less certain. In the meantime, one can get a sense of the field from the much acclaimed Karel van der Toorn, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scribal-Culture-Making-Hebrew-Bible/dp/0674032543/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291696585&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Scribal Culture and the Making of the Hebrew Bible</em></a> (available <a href="http://www.nautilus-solar.net/SandyGunfox/books/T/Toorn,%20Karel%20Van%20Der/Toorn,%20Karel%20Van%20Der%20-%20Scribal%20Culture%20and%20the%20Making%20of%20the%20Hebrew%20Bible.pdf"> as pdf here</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/31312583/Scribal-Culture-and-the-Making-of-the-Hebrew-Bible">from scribd here</a>), William Schniedewind, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Bible-Became-Book-Textualization/dp/0521536227/ref=pd_sim_b_3">How the Bible Became a Book</a>, and  John Van Seters, <a href="http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/5237_5516.pdf">The Edited Bible: The Curious History of the “Editor” in Biblical Criticism.</a></p>
<div>
<p>Berman’s approach to his task seems to have three parts. (1) To credibly add to the evidence showing affinity between the Torah and the literature of the Late Bronze Age and the era of Moses  (2) To show that the repetitions and contradictions found within the Torah demonstrate unity in a manner foreign to our modern conceptions, but more apparent when seen in the perspective of a range of ancient Near Eastern literary genres. such as the Code of Hammurabi and the Gilgamesh Epic (3) To then show that the Bible has a unique message that transcends its ancient context and is still worth reading today.</p>
<p>In order to move his theories from possible ideas to a probable hypothesis, he needs to write peer reviewed articles that suggest a greater affinity to the literature of the late-second millennium, based on credible parallels with ancient Near Eastern literature. He also must be on his guard not to slip into a Bible as literature mode, such as explaining narrative repetition but does not actually answer historical questions. The project wont refute academic trends, rather offer a credible apologetic. If he does enough drafts and listens carefully to his critics, then he may possibly create the major apologetic work, that barring new archeological finds, will last for decades. Berman’s current project has the potential to be the new Umberto Cassutto or Nahum Sarna.</p>
<p>In his morning talk, he discussed Deut 13, which is universally taken in the academy to buttress a seventh century dating for Deuteronomy in light of strong parallels to the Vassal Treaty of Esarhaddon. Instead, he presented a 15c BCE Hittite text which according to Berman is much closer to Deuteronomy. He gave <a href="http://www.biblicallaw.net/2010/berman.pdf">a version of the talk at SBL, available online, </a>and it will be published in JBL in a few months.</p>
<p>The person sitting next to me who has read the scholarly literature asked: why does Berman assume an edited lack of contradiction? Why do we not assume that the scribal editor wanted to preserve all fragments since they considered them holy and prophetic?</p>
<p>Berman is part of the Shalem Center&#8217;s quest for a Biblical philosophy,  bypassing Rabbinic categories, to be used for a broad conservative  ideology. But Berman is actually trained in Bible. If one has read the literature in the field, much of what Berman says is a somewhat old-hat. It is a reworking and expansion of Mendelhall’s understanding of Ancient Near East vassal treaty covenants as relating to the Bible. One should compare Berman to entirely different presentations of the same material, such as that of Jon Levenson&#8217;s <em>Sinai and Zion. </em>So too, finding a polemical moral superiority to Israelite religion over polytheism goes back to John Selden in the 17th century. The Jewish authors Yehezkel Kaufman and Nahum Sarna, followed Hermann Cohen, and presented an opposition of Biblical ethical monotheism to the polytheist’s lack of morality. Berman manages to give  his own formulation connecting the Bible to social ethos and liberal communitarianism.Now, read his responses and help his project by asking thoughtful questions.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1: Do you think  reconciling biblical criticism is possible as an orthodox Jew without  sounding like an Evangelical?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: To be honest, I wish  we were responding more like the Evangelicals, or at least some of them.    Like orthodox Jews, Evangelical Christians are spread across a wide  gamut of positions.  Some are more fundamentalist and less  sophisticated,  just like in our own community.  But many are fully engaged with the  world of scholarship, including biblical scholarship &#8211; more so, I would  say, than we are.  There are literally dozens of evangelical scholars,  whose work is respected, who ask tough about the reigning paradigms  within the field, and produce thoughtful insights that have been a great   source of inspiration for me.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: Are the  responses  to Biblical criticism written by of Rabbi Dovid Zvei Hoffmann and  Umberto  Cassutto still relevant today?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Rabbi Dovid Zvei Hoffman passed away in 1921, and Umberto  Cassuto  in 1951.  I can&#8217;t think of a field of inquiry where the questions of  today could be answered by works in the field penned 60 or 90 years  ago.  Each thinker had key insights,(See  the Shalem Press reprint of Cassuto’s  classic work, <em>The Documentary Hypothesis</em> with an introduction  by Berman – A.B.). But the field of biblical studies has progressed  enormously in the last half century. Today, the questions being asked  are different, and the range of answers being offered is much broader.   Our knowledge and understanding of the ancient Near East is enormously  greater. We now know more about Akkadian and Ugaritic texts, we have  new texts from Ras Shamra,  Ebla, and Elephantine. The field has new  approaches to source criticism.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:  Why do Orthodox Jews and Evangelicals still talk about the  Documentary </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>ypothesis, when many have been using a  form-tradition  model based on Hermann Gunkel or a supplemental model  based on John Van Seters or Rolf Rendtorff?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: John Van Who?  Rolf  Who? As someone working in the field, I am familiar with the work of  these scholars, but I suspect that few of your readers are.  And that&#8217;s  just the point.  Even in an age of internet, the vast majority of people   don’t tune in to the proceedings of the Society of Biblical Literature  &#8211; all these new theories are, for most people, the stuff of the ivory  tower. </p>
<p>Julius Wellhausen, and his  documentary hypothesis were different. A hundred years ago, Wellhausen&#8217;s   theory spread like wildfire, it was debated in the popular arena , and  was the uncontested truth about the Torah in much of the western world  for a full century.  It explained everything in a nice neat package &#8211;  what was written by whom, when, and why, and how one nice neat stage  led to another.  Wellhausen was a late 19th century German, where big  ideas were in vogue (think Hegel, Harnack, and just a little later Frued   and Einstein).  Even though the academy has largely repudiated  Wellhausen  over the last 30 years, his work has become part of the fabric of  western  culture, and that&#8217;s what people know about.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: If the flood  story appears to be based on the Mesopotamian accounts, then why look  for moral teachings and deeper meanings in the Torah version? Why did  the Torah teach the flood story at all?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: I don&#8217;t know what  really  happened with the flood, Noah, or the animals. Even the Rambam allowed  that it might not be literal.</p>
<p>I do know, however, that when  we compare the flood narrative of Gen 6-9 to the Mesopotamian flood  traditions we see one thing: that the Genesis account  is engaged in theological polemic with the other known story. </p>
<p>The Mesopotamians were caught  in a bind: since the gods created men to be their servants, why is there   famine and disease in the world?  The Mesopotamian flood story gives  the answer: the gods were troubled by overpopulation of the world,  because  &#8211; and this is what is says &#8211; there were so many humans, making so much  noise, that they were disturbing the sleep of the gods!  So the gods  sent all manner of suffering to kill off people, culminating with the  flood, and following which, the gods introduced fertility problems into  the world, to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The Torah spins all that on its head: humanity suffers not because it  disturbs the gods&#8217; sleep, but because of its misdeeds.  In the  Mesopotamian  story, the &#8220;Noah&#8221; figure escapes only because a rogue god  tipped him off, and told him to build an ark. In the Torah, saving a  remnant of humanity was always part of the plan, and the choice of whom  to save was based on righteous deeds.  The Torah&#8217;s flood story ends with   a ringing affirmation of human reproduction: &#8220;And the Lord said  to Noah and to his sons, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the  land.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Do you have any thoughts on  the classical positions on Revelation?</strong></p>
<p>I know that the classical  sources  of Machshevet Yisrael pursue this topic great length.  In a personal  admission I will say that I was never very good at Machshevet Yisrael.   When reading the Torah or the Nevi&#8217;im I proceed from a supposition that   the only way that I will properly understand the message of the text  is if I take it literally.  An analogy: I know, intellectually, that  it is pointless to describe the Almighty as &#8220;angry&#8221; &#8220;loving&#8221;,  etc.  I know that mouthing the words of the tefillah is unnecessary for  God to know what I&#8217;m thinking.  Utilizing these terms, however, is the  best way for me to relate to the Almighty. Over-speculation on what  He is really like, will actually detract me from the proper service  of Him.  I don&#8217;t know what it means when the Torah says, &#8220;God spoke  to Moses saying&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; but I do know (or, this is my operating belief,  anyway) that I will only be able to grasp the Torah&#8217;s message (dare  I use the Christian term &#8220;kerygma&#8221;?) if I relate to that phrase  in its simplest manner.</p></div>

				<p>This is from <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/the-disney-ization-of-faith">internetmonk.com by Chaplain Mike</a>, my favorite watchers of all things post-evangelical. This offers further thoughts on the role of culture and relgion. How much of Centrism, year in Israel or kiruv &#8211; Is to provide magic moments? How much is heart-tugging sentimentality? How much is the state of Israel views as a theme park? And how did the super cognitive Rabbi Soloveitchik create a rabbinate of sentimental kitsch? Did the acculturation into Evangelical America override anything else? How much of the visions of Torah circulating have mawkish origins far from anything in the Talmud or  classic Biblical commentaries, let alone the classic of Jewish thought? Why do we can this shallow frumkieit a form a Torah? At least, the Gra and his followers would reject the folk relgion of the prostaks. It seems we are not Litvaks anymore.  </p>
<p><em>Disney does not fool me into thinking what they do is great art containing profound insights into life and the human experience. I accept and enjoy them for what they are, no more. Their artists and animators are first class and what they do, they do well… They take stories that are classic because of their universal themes and dumb them down so that the kids can enjoy them with mom and dad. They remove all the messiness, complexity, nuance, and grit from these tales and sanitize them for a G or PG-rated modern entertainment audience. They are enjoyable, but as subtle as a punch in the face; as deep as the puddle in my driveway after a light rain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many American Christian leaders seem to think the Disney way is the way forward for the church. I could write a long book about all the examples of this across our land, from the many ways we market Jesus in books, music, and media, to the kistchy excess of  the televangelists and the corporate “excellence” of the megachurches, to iconic monuments like the Crystal Cathedral. So much of it represents the “Magic Kingdom” mentality.</p>
<p>In the cartoon world of contemporary American evangelicalism, it’s all about bigger, better, and simpler. Help folks think their dreams can come true. Create “moments” for people in the congregation that they will never forget, that will “bless” families in safe and sanitized settings. Remove the messiness and reality of day to day life. Instead, put a sentimental, heart-tugging version of life up on the screen and make people feel it. Embrace the possibilities.</p>
<p>The Creation Museum near Cincinnati has decided to expand and build an 800-acre theme-park style complex featuring a replica of Noah’s Ark. The project will cost an estimated 125 million dollars and is projected to open in 2014 in nearby Williamstown, KY.<br />
Some have questioned whether it is legally permissible for the state of Kentucky to fund a religious theme park. I raise another question: Is it appropriate for Christians to “Disney-ize” their faith like this? </p>
<p>They know what they believe already. And believing, they have set out to shape reality according to that image and make a new “dream come true.”</p>
<p>•	Noah’s Ark. The Ark will be the park’s central attraction. Guests will take a tour of the structure so that they may “gain an understanding of how it could have been built, and how Noah, his family, and all of the representative kinds of land animals were cared for, and then survived on board for 370 days of the Flood and its aftermath.” Given the fact that Scripture says nothing about any of this, one wonders about how “Biblical” these “themed presentations” will be. The highlight of each day will be a spectacular show “featuring the ‘parade of animals’ and the dramatic ‘eruption of the fountains of the great deep.’” Will there be re-enactments of sinners drowning and crying out in hysteria and panic? Carcasses of dead, bloated animals floating on the surface of the lake? A nearby ravaged landscape? Will the greatest historical example of God’s wrath and judgment being poured out on the earth be “fun” and “exciting” or will it communicate anything at all about the actual fear of God and the reality of Divine judgment?.</p>
<p>Please. I will respond as clearly and directly and forcefully as I can—this project has nothing to do with Biblical Christianity.<br />
This is cartoon faith. It represents the “Disney-ization” of the Biblical story. I mean, seriously. Christian people are going to waste $125 million building this travesty, and then undiscerning American believers will spend countless millions more to be indoctrinated, wowed by spectacle and a thoroughly sanitized version of the Biblical story. Bus-loads of young people from entertainment-seeking youth groups will be “educated” in a “Biblical” interpretation of the Flood that had its “genesis” not in the Torah but in the visions of Ellen G. White, whose “inspired counsels from the Lord” guided the 19th century sectarian Adventist movement.</p>
<p>Those visions will come to life in true Disney-like fashion—with overwhelming kitsch, mawkish sentimentality, a thin veneer of credibility, and, most importantly, the absolute conviction of unwavering belief in spite of any contrary evidence or countering interpretations. This project is fundamentalism at its creative worst. <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/the-disney-ization-of-faith">Read the Full version here.</a></em></p>
