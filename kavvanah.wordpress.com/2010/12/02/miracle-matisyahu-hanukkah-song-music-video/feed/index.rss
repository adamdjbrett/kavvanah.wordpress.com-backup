Mass media reflects, and influences powerfully, the way people think and behave.  If mainstream reggae fans think of Matisyahu as just another performer, that&#039;s a step towards non-Jews ability to speak with Jewish-looking people like they speak with anyone else.   

I hope next to see a turban-wearing Sikh on &quot;Yo! MTV Raps.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In watching these new  Chanukah videos, including this piece de resistance, the hokey and offensive Matisyahu rap, I began to reminisce of my own youth and the  differences with today. I was surrounded by, knew, really fantastic people, my age and older. I could not believe the amount of Torah and  “other stuff “, (math., physics, culture) people knew. My idealization of others was endless, and an enormous motivation to study. It wasn’t so much the teachers, though they were frequently very good,  but the high brow intellectual quality of my peers and chabura. 
Though Agudah was major, there was also Mizrachi, who were not michutz lamachane. Until today I can’t understand why MO centrists are not more firmly tied to RZ and their culture. They are the center and the future, and we are the provincials. The vulnerability to schlock culture would then be diluted. 
I grew up like this… my mother took me to the library as soon as I could read, and then my parents left me alone. No one told me what to read. And I read as I please, until today.  I really can’t understand the agmas nefesh so many people have in forcing everything to integrate and be on one page. This integration of Torah and science, and Torah culture and secular culture,  is like mourning the death of a loved one. It happens by itself, time and the unconscious relieve the despair, with each person healing  in a somewhat different way. Today everyone is a theologian, and everyone knows there is a best way, which just happens to be their way. This need for there to be one page, which is both Jewish and contemporary is one major cause for this lack of bildung, i.e. the education and refinement of aesthetic sensibilities and judgments. It’s difficult to parody Mahler’s 9th symphony, but quite easy to take a Beach Boys tune and add a few “Hashems’ to the lyrics. Because so many of these Orthodox derivative retreads have a 1950&#039;s wholesome quality, a guy like Matisyahu who is far from the reggae and rapper life ideals can seem like something hip and edgy.    
Kolel people used to say ”In America, the country is so rich and there are so many opportunities, you can live off the crumbs left on the table.” I took this maxim to heart. Today the world is so much more difficult,  and one has to know so much more just to get along. There might indeed be a connection as AS suggested, between the changes in the economic structures and this compulsion to see oneself mirrored in the popular culture. Worth exploring.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen the Matisyahu video on my Facebook feed mostly being shared by adults, up to and beyond middle-age.  My suspicion is that if someone had passed them a video of my 4 year old daughter reciting the blessings on the menorah they would all be sharing that as well.  It&#039;s also worth analyzing how different age groups relate to all this.

In terms of Howard Jacobson&#039;s op-ed yesterday, will the kitsch and self parody of the Maccabeats eventually be the equivalent of the family  pretending to be excitedly engaged by the annual game of dreidel?

Forget Matisyahu v. Shiur.  The real conflict will be between Matisyahu and those two cartoon bears that will be the conveyors of all significant discourse for the next month or so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So let&#039;s bring in some other videos for the discussion.

Here&#039;s the Maccabeats, the YU a capella group, which was forwarded by an Orthodox relative:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJCSR4MuhU

Note that it is a parody of this summer&#039;s popular song. Note also that the religious content is not much higher than &quot;I had a little dreidel.&quot; (Exploring the Maccabeats on iTune, I discover that their first album includes a pop song and a Disney song with no modifications to the lyrics, as well as Shabbos songs and a classic Israeli pop song from the 70s.

I find more spirituality in two songs from artists who are part of the non-Orthodox world, playing gigs at Schechter day schools and Limmud.

Here&#039;s a new video from MyJewishLearning.com for a Bible Raps song:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIT57hHJhsY

Not a video, but a new song by Naomi Less and friends:
