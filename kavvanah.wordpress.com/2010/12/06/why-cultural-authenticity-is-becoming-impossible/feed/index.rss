					<description><![CDATA[Are these bloggers saying all our presentations are inauthentic? Are there no differences between those who are the way they appear and those who are phony? We’re not talking about the possibility of error, but of a systemic breakdown between appearance and reality. For example Is gender a performance, not indicative of our personality. Heterosexual couples  live together for many decades and it’s all a show. Is a  Rolex and a  $25 Chinese- knockoff equal except for price, because both are unreal? 

When it comes to fashion, I would argue there is some non-arbitrary connection between the way a person looks in public, the way they put themselves together, and who they are. This is true despite the fact that all the clothes and all the personal styling are purchased, many times at high end stores with huge profit margins.  It’s complicated since the connections are neither necessary or sufficient. Nevertheless not all looks are inauthentic, i.e making believe they are what they are not, any more than all actors are equally effective. As a proof text I refer to Goffman’s famous book, and the very popular, much admired  blog The Sartorialist. The blogger shoots photos of people he sees on the streets who he thinks looked great. (http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/) Many do look just terrific, and many times this is an indication of who they are, e.g. chic, stylish, rich, together, hip and many other possible adjectives.
Some philosophers are skeptical about enduring selves and the constancy of personality and character. This  skepticism about how to identify an inner continuous self goes back to Shakespeare and Montaigne, and has little to do with authenticity or post cultural America, whatever that might be. (See Colin McGinn’s “Shakespeare’s Philosophy.”)

(Though it wasn’t apparent to me at the time, I wrote  many posts dancing around these questions of authenticity. My favorites  are McMansions and McJews (11/12) on what is authentic , Femme Fatale Bais Yaakov Girls (12/09) on truth in advertising,  and What Is Modern Orthodox (12/19).) http://evanstonjew.blogspot.com )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that the notion of authenticity is at best vexed - and probably has only ever been self-ascribed when indigenous and non self-reflective cultural performance was no no longer possible; but &quot;Post Cultural America&quot;? What could that possibly mean?

In any event, the idea of authenticity has been a driving force in Orthodoxy writ large. In America its has successfully vied with other denominations for the mantle of authentic, and used that to attract baalei teshuva searching for something that speaks to their Roman Vishniac inspired yearnings. 

Centrism has relied on some unspoken idea of intellectual authenticity to provide the authenticity it lacks in its other cultural engagements. It is telling that much of R. Soloveithik&#039;s writing drips with nostalgia for the lost authenticity of his childhood.]]></description>
