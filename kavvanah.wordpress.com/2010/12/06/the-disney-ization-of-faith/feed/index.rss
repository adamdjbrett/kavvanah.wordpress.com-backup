					<description><![CDATA[Kudos to AS and Avraham Bornstein for their incisive comments . Even if you are a parent who is visiting a child in a yeshiva or seminary for a year or so, you cannot help but notice the  contrast between Israel as a lofty religious reality that hopefully provides MO post high school students with a sense of profundity and a message that is missing in their homes, schools and communities and the sociological/economic realities that are basically a quick walk, taxi or bus ride  from any luxury hotel room or apartment.  The real issue remains how much of the year in Israel experience translates into genuine religious growth in the Bein Adam LChavero and Bein Adam LaMakom spheres.]]></description>

The idea of sending kids to experience something authentic and immersive that cannot be found in Centrist America is not unlike the Rav&#039;s sentimental hearkening back to the formative experiences of his childhood where religiosity was inculcated in an immersive culture of simple faith and learning Torah appeared as engaging in mythic struggles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;..how did the super cognitive Rabbi Soloveitchik create a rabbinate of sentimental kitsch?&quot;
Year-in-Israel-as-theme-park (something that was true even 10+ years ago) works culturally (in terms of the Kimsitz-y Religious Zionism and the visits to the Kotel/Mahane Yehuda/Random Tisch in Me&#039;ah She&#039;arim, etc.), but it also works intellectually.
Centrist Orthodoxy prides itself on asking the &quot;tough&quot; questions or &quot;struggling with tension between x and y,&quot; but never really considers the possibility of not having a pat answer (Genesis and the Big Bang is sort of a theme park in book form, obviating the need to read Genesis in any spiritual or theological way and rest assured that the &quot;right&quot; answers are pre-coded, readable while sitting in the recliner on a Shabbat afternoon, and largely irrelevant to how we live our lives) or having that tension disrupt a normative suburban lifestyle (contrast the issues that trouble The Lonely Man of Faith with the major issue facing our communities, namely, the affordibility of private day schools).

&lt;strong&gt;From his blog post.&lt;/strong&gt; (site owner)

First, the idea of Israel-as-theme-park is hot these days, after being forcefully raised by left-wing Zionists such as Peter Beinart (see last week’s Jewish Week).  Disney-ification means only focusing on  happy, uplifting facts and narratives, and ignoring what may lie beneath the surface.  The sunset over the hilltops, Carlebach music, Eim HaBanim S’meicha, and all that are great, but over 20% of the country and 35% of children live beneath the poverty line, mostly Israeli Arabs and Haredim.  That’s obviously not part of the reality for the American in yeshiva there, but it should be part of the awareness.

Second, in terms of magic moments, this could also be part of the discussion of experiencing Chanukah as a Maccabeats YouTube video as opposed to a discussion about globalization (where the US plays the role of the Greeks).  Disney-ification means thinking about familiar themes (latkes, dreidels) in a familiar, fun medium (pop music video) as opposed to thinking about the larger themes of the story and what they might mean for us (here’s a funny take on someone doing a similar type of thing to the Disney Princesses).  This is the equivalent of focusing on the cutesy animals walking into the Ark and ignoring the sinners drowning below.

Third, even if Centrist Orthodoxy doesn’t build theme parks pe se (probably because we’re too busy paying tuition), we are very good at building intellectual theme parks.  For example, as well-researched and thorough as books like Genesis &#038; The Big Bang might be, they’re essentially doing the same thing as the Noah’s Ark exhibit.  Reading Genesis as a metaphor for modern science means that we get to know the answers at the end – or at least we get to know that the answers are there, just as soon as science discovers them.  As we read our book on Shabbat afternoon leaning back into our recliners, we know there’s a neat resolution in the end – Science and Faith get married and live happily ever after.  The tension and apparent conflict is really only a narrative device; if anything, it only makes the experience more fun, and, in the end, we get the satisfaction of knowing that we were right all along.

Upon reflection, how many of the other built-in “conflicts” that Centrist Orthodoxy likes to grapple with are pre-packaged with pat solutions or dodges that don’t really get in the way of our comfortable, acculturated existence?]]></description>
