					<description><![CDATA[I’ve been under the impression that [QCK]abbalah’s spelling (yes, I know there are also older variants with one or two ‘b’s, or without an ‘h’), mostly went according to faith. That is, Kabbalah is Jewish, Cabbalah is Christian, and Qabbalah is Crowley/GD/new-age. Which is why I stick with the K, even though I often transliterate quf with a ‘q’ otherwise.

the N-gram is interesting – it was almost entirely Cab[b]ala before 1950, with huge spikes in the mid-1660s and 1690-1710, I wonder why. I suppose the 1660s would be Sabbatai Sevi and the Christian hebraists/cabalists, and maybe Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbala Denudata (1677-84)?

Qabbalah appears in the 1880s, probably with the European occult revival, W. Wynn Westcott and others, disappears, and reappears in the late 1950s.]]></description>
