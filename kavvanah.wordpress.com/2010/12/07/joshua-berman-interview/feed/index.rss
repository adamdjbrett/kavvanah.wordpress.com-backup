					<description><![CDATA[Michael: See Guide 1:26, where the Rambam explains  that &quot;the Torah speaks in the language of the sons of man&quot; means according to the  imagination of the multitude. As for the Kuzari, the phrase  &quot;the Torah speaks in the language of the sons of man&#039;&quot; is only cited at the very end of the book. I hope to write  about this sometime.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks.

&quot;he would consider it wrong to reject all the sensuous concepts of anthropomorphism, as there is something in these ideas which fills the human soul with the awe of God.&quot;

That&#039;s what I meant. Or, to quote Berman, &quot;Utilizing these terms, however, is the best way for me to relate to the Almighty.&quot; We know that God doesn&#039;t actually do or feel the way we describe Him, but we cannot imagine Him any other way, and we have to imagine Him &lt;i&gt;somehow&lt;/i&gt; in order to have a relationship with him (which is in turn necessary to have awe of Him), even though we know that our imagination of Him is technically incorrect. I&#039;m reminded of Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits&#039;s saying that you can have poor theology but good metaphysics, or good theology and poor metaphysics.

But now I&#039;m having trouble remembering whether the Kuzari, like the Rambam, thinks that some anthropomorphisms are merely indicative that God acts in a way that were we to feel X emotion, that we would act the same; e.g. we say He is angry when He acts in a way that if we acted that way, it would be out of anger. I forget what the Kuzari says about the attributes of action and activities of God, but at this point, it&#039;d probably be best for me to just study the Kuzari again, LOL.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Brill writes: &quot;in order to move his theories from possible ideas to a probable hypothesis, he needs to write peer reviewed articles that suggest a greater affinity to the literature of the late-second millennium, based on credible parallels with ancient Near Eastern literature.&quot;
I&#039;m curious to see how this particular issue will play out. Dr. Berman is arguing with more or less an iron-clad scholarly concensus regarding dating, give or take a few hundred years in either direction. This defines the assumptions of the academic discourse in Bible and  thus what is allowed in a peer-reviewed journal. To use a imerfect analogy from my field, the same way you cannot submit an article to a peer-reviewed journal that treats Ravina and Rav Ashi as the redactors of the Bavli, I don&#039;t see how review committees will publish  work that assumes a 13th century dating for Leviticus.  The only way to do this is to command an enormous amount of respect in circles that continue to debate the dating of the Pentateuch and then to completely change the direction of the field.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the Kuzari- it is similar but not the same way of getting there. Kuzari dissolved the need for essential attributes and did not think predication was ever about essence.  Here, it is without the scholastic argument and he actually accentuates the simple meaning.

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the JE
In the second essay Judah  enters into a detailed discussion of some of the theological questions hinted at in the preceding one. To these belongs in the first place that of the divine attributes. Judah rejects entirely the doctrine of essential attributes which had been propounded by Saadia and Baḥya. For him there is no difference between essential and other attributes. Either the attribute affirms a quality in God, in which case essential attributes can not be applied to Him more than can any other, because it is impossible to predicate anything of Him, or the attribute expresses only the negation of the contrary quality, and in that case there is no harm in using any kind of attributes. &#039;Accordingly Judah  divides all the attributes found in the Bible into three classes: active, relative, and negative, which last class comprises all the essential attributes expressing mere negations.

The question of attributes being closely connected with that of anthropomorphism, Judah enters into a lengthy discussion on this point. Although opposed to the conception of the corporeality of God, as being contrary to Scripture, he would consider it wrong to reject all the sensuous concepts of anthropomorphism, as there is something in these ideas which fills the human soul with the awe of God.
