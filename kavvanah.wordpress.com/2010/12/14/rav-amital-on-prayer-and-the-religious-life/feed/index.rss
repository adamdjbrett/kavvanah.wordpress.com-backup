					<description><![CDATA[Rav Amital and Abba Kovner&#039;s exchange and the disinterest in Judaism of their generation as the reason for a failed TV program....now we face something so similar, but as phenomena within the Dati world - not simply the &quot;Jewish&quot; world at large, let alone Israel -  in all the spheres; the various Orthoprax, skeptics, etc. Viruses strains of unlearned, dilettante  and bitter skepticism, desperation and spiritual desolation have infected all the &quot;Jewish&quot; species, leaving none unaltered. Some years ago, R. Amital had written several times on youth at risk and the commitment crisis, &quot;KhaBaKookniks&quot;, etc. What would be said about the Dati world now?]]></description>
