					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not unfamiliar with the transplanted culture that you describe- but recall that for many of these people their aspirations for their children was upper class American economic, educational, and cultural success. 

I  uncritically accept the Americanization of M. Orthodoxy because that is the description that best fits it - and the one that it self-ascribed during its formative periods. I could wish it to be many other things - but I can&#039;t pretend that it is otherwise. I am looking for the narrative that can take that description and turn it into the &quot;something special&quot; that you describe. But at minimal the narrative has to fit reality. Centrist American Jews are not going to create a subculture that is not distinctly American. 

Without narrative to play a role in identify formation I believe that everything else is tinkering at the margins. A successful community center or wonderful experiences are great, but they need to fit into a larger context of meaning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up in a community made up of refugees, and in time survivors. Being refugees, the community was poorer than say the Hamptons, more like Flatbush today . My parents took me every shabbus afternoon for a shpatzir, a stroll, as is the custom in many Jewish neighborhoods. I remember the people we encountered as elegant  in a 1940&#039;s way, especially the women. When I see photos of Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner and even Lana Turner I am reminded of the look of the period. In the stores there were no designer labels these women could afford, though if they had the money few would have been adverse to buying such clothes, even if they had known that future generations would describe it as “a gauche form of class ordering.” Like many Europeans they took exceptional care of their clothes, they cared how they look. They knew what they were doing because they had spent many years in European places that were west of Moldavia. Rebuilding what was lost in Europe was for them much more than rebuilding Transylvania or the backwaters of the Ukraine. They certainly weren&#039;t following the style of the poor and prust non Jews who lived in the environs. Making a long story short, &#039;everyone&#039; thought they were somewhere; they felt they were  in a cosmopolitan and almost enchanted place. Vienna or Budapest without the Nazis. They weren’t happy they stayed Orthodox, they were Orthodox, as in what else could there possibly be?

What is required is that MO Jews create a feeling that by being MO one ends up somewhere special, minimally  a member in a group that nobody wants to leave even if the transportations costs were zero. As you point out the  particular form of elitism that is the Young Israel of Brookline is not easily scalable. But there are many ways to create special places. I am using style  to include fashion, but also in the more general sense to include the many different elements that can be shaped in individual ways and that as a group create a culture. Successful examples of creating Jewish special places are the community centers in Latin America, and the &#039;Our Crowd&#039; quality of German Reform Judaism. I don’t know why you accept so uncritically the Americanization of M. Orthodoxy? In doing so you more or less hardwire the MO world into being provincial, whether in New Jersey or Illinois.

I wrote about these topics many times  on my short lived  blog,  (6/20, 6/21, 8/17, 10/16, 10/29, 11/9, 11/29.) Speaking only to the point that looking great is tied to money and labels, I suggest skimming  through a few months of  the very popular blog, The Sartorialist. http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I think because charedim are more stylish than MO, especially those MO in the provinces.&quot;

I&#039;m not sure if ej&#039;s comment was partly intended as farce. 

There is a notable lack of up to the minute &#039;style&#039; in the Midwest, in general. (recall the 30 Rock episode where Liz travels to Cleveland and keeps getting asked if she is a model). But being attracted to clothing with prominent designer labels is certainly not high style - it&#039;s a gauche form of class ordering. 

(Honestly, if it was style that was attracting people to hareidi lifestyles you would expect BTs as a group to not be consistently identifiable by ill fitting garb.)

Centrists simply follow prevailing American norms of dressing casually under most circumstances while haredim notably encourage formal dress no matter what the occasion. The wealthiest of the Hampton&#039;s summer congregants probably don&#039;t even wear socks to shul. But this is not being more or less stylish - it&#039;s simply conforming to a cultural norm. Within that norm style and taste is a means of class differentiation, but as you get increasingly upscale it becomes harder for the uninitiated to notice the difference. You can spend a lot of money to look like you didn&#039;t. 

Anyway, the point is that rich centrists tend to dress like rich Americans, middle class centrists in the Midwest like Midwestern Americans. The yeshivish crowds in the Midwest usually dress like frumpier versions of the yeshivish circles they correspond to in the NY region. 

This tells us what? that MO people need a better dress code? Why?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MBG...I am not so sure I know how to separate pnimiyus from chitzoniyus. Maybe it’s like this. Clothes, furniture, personality, eloquence, empathy, social virtues   ultimately depend for their value on being appreciated by others. Not so Torah; there is  value created in an individual internalizing  the ideas  of Torah, even when never recognized by others. You can have a scholar a lamed vovnik, but a lamid vovnik dandy, a Robinson Crusoe  orator would be kind of stupid. Like for whom? 
The standard religious model for Orthodoxy is that of a solitary individual standing in some proper relationship  to God. The ideal might be prayer &#038; internalizing or downloading torah, both of which are open ended and endless tasks, plus the fulfillment of a finite set of duties to others. The MO we are discussing are not yeshivish endless learners nor are they endless daveners and tehilim sayers. Against such a background does it make sense to modify the standard religious model by substituting a little learning, a little davening and a lot of free time?

I am suggesting a different picture. A good part of our morality, our language and our ability to function in the world comes from our socialization into our family and larger community. We are not born as existential man quivering before God. We quickly become and are first and foremost actors in a social theater, and both the quality and success of our life depends on our performance in a social  space. We mostly are, and in general ought to be, striving for excellence in our social world.  How we decide to present ourselves, how we choose to look, how we put together an appealing and satisfying performance,  are all  part of our life task. MO however understood is one more ingredient amongst many that is important in the shaping and presentation of our self.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;so much attention goes into the minutiae, especially with the women.&quot;    I agree with the general point that boredom need not be counteracted with an overarching narrative, but I am struggling with the focus on style.  I mean, the obsession with how women dress in the yeshivish world is intimately bound up with treating women as, dare i say, means rather than ends.  (Also, my knee-jerk reaction as supremely unfashionable person is that if saving MO involves even more chitzoniyus than what exactly are we saving?)

A different point:  How much of the &quot;bordeom&quot; of centrism in the heartland relates to the success of zionism in those communities?  (did everyone engaged and itnerested in &quot;narratives&quot; move to israel?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The post by AS reflects my own experiences when I first came to Chicago. Since I&#039;ve been here many years, the other comments also ring true. I have a more general problem with this idea that Centrism needs a narrative. A convincing intellectual story is not so easy to come by, and I don&#039;t feel the YU or charedi story is so obviously compelling, so as to say that is what&#039;s missing with Centrists. 
We know charedim like to strut their stuff, there is a buzz, sometimes even an edge  attached to being a member of one of the different charedi groups. Why?  I think because charedim are more stylish than MO, especially those MO in the provinces.  Charedim don&#039;t get to choose their outfits, so much attention goes into the minutiae,  especially with the women. The Budapest  wannabe Parisian  look has come to dominate, and women are thinking more of Chanel than TJMaxx.   Centrists can choose from a variety of styles but  entropy seems to pull these communities away from high style to a less upscale look. Many women end up in denim  skirts, sneakers and a snood on the frum side, and GAP and maybe Ann Taylor on the more liberal side.
 As we move away from Orthodoxy people recognize that what they are going to be depends on their own choices. At the Wilde-Nietzsche extreme each of us becomes our own art project. I know this may sound odd, but when there is a life of on the one hand following the shulchan aruch, and on the other autonomy in an American setting, a boring quality sets in that is perceived as such. The reason centrists run down over time is because  there is a laxity in their cultivation of style and in the presentation of the self. 
There is something sad to my ear when a person defines themselves as Modern- Orthodox- but...&quot;I’m MO but fully participate in the world. I go to movies, ski etc.&quot; It always sounds like catch up, and it frequently is. The solution to the boredom of Centrism is not to accept it as normal, but for each member to live a more stylish, more exciting life, whether intellectual, social or decorative. No ideology needed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Without speaking directly about the Midwestern experience, I want to echo Arie&#039;s comments that Centrism is an elitist ideology. However, so is Conservative Judaism. Practitioners of centrist positions are rarely ideologues of centrism, they are people who live pragmatic lives of compromise. 

The larger issue with the disappearance of centrism is that institutional leadership has encouraged a cloistered Orthodoxy that is less tolerant of deviation from halachic and cultural norms, and that does not welcome (and barely tolerates) cross-denominational communication at the institutional or personal levels. In areas of high concentration, like NYC, that means lots of kosher restaurants, shiurim, etc. Anywhere else, where there is not that critical mass of population to allow for a self-sustaining Orthodox bubble, adherents can&#039;t live an Orthodox life true to the norms and values of its teachers and institutional heads.

What&#039;s interesting about all this is that while YU rabbinical graduates rarely go to smaller and newer communities in the midwest or the southwest, YCT grads are jumping in to fill the void with a progressive Orthodoxy that is much closer to the politics of Jews generally, that is more open to religious diversity, and that is much less based in Zionism as a validating component of Diaspora Judaism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in St. Louis, MO and would agree that many of his points hold true here.  After growing up here I attended YU and stayed in NYC for several years and decided to move back for personal reasons.  As I work from home I thought it would offer me the best bang for the buck and a simpler, more wholesome life that is simply impossible in NY.  All that has been true, but I certainly underestimated the spiritual void of not being in a robust Centrist Orthodox community.  Among my peers from childhood, almost nobody else has moved back home - after experiencing the East Coast (Ivy Leagues, YU, shul choices, kosher options, good jobs in finance) it is simply untenable to come back here.  So the centrist ortho community is declining.  Because of the strong medical community and university presence there is constant influx of young intellectuals and professionals from the East Coast, and many admit to liking it here for many reasons, but it is transient.  Few stay beyond the fellowships, residencies and degree completions.  I sometimes regret making the move myself.  As AS mentions, I am able to compensate with shiurim and chavrutot, mostly among the more haredi group (there are actually some very accomplished and interesting talmidei chachamim here, even if they are mostly chumra sympathizers), and to make the most of online resources such as this forum and regularly engaging with friends back East via email, phone and even regular trips back to NYC. 

Unlike AS describes, the centrist ortho crowd here is rather accomplished professionally, a large majority with higher degrees, and most of the youth go on to hesder yeshivot, YU and Ivy Leagues;  however, spirtual dialogue at shabbat tables is mostly saddening.  Most have no idea what goes on back East (of course there are some exceptions), or even that there is  a religious intellectual elite.   Mostly they pride themselves on not being rude and obnoxious New Yorkers who wouldn&#039;t even asnwer shabbat shalom to a fellow Jew on the way to shul.  

 CJF recognizes the waning Centrist Orthodoxy in smaller towns and supposedly has made some attempt to be mechazek them by offering to help defray the cost of starting a YU Kollel (we still can&#039;t afford one and probably won&#039;t happen anytime soon) and trying to send scholars in residence etc...I have heard CJF had plans to take on one or two communities as pet projects and St. Louis was in the running, but that was a few years ago and I don&#039;t know which cities were chosen, if any.

There is a strong sense of Zionistic pride (G-d Forbid you talk during the prayer for Israel and the gov&#039;t you can make some enemies), but like AS says, there isn&#039;t much ideological narrative.  We do have a Kollel Mitzion comprised of very nice hard working young Israeli families, but their work is mostly focused on school children.

One thing I will say that is quite refreshing here is the ability to engage in many camps - I have chavrutot with haredi kollel members, the Rabbi of the left leaning modern ortho shul, a strange hasid who is extremely well versed in Lurianic Kabbalah and can have them all over for a shabbat meal together.  I&#039;m the exception rather than rule in this regard, but I&#039;m certainly not looked at as strange.  Living in Teaneck or Riverdale this would not be possible.  I can afford a nice lifestyle and school tuitions without working till 11pm.  It&#039;s also refreshing that many people have no clue or care what I do for a living,  as work is rarely a topic of social conversation, whereas on the East coast I found it to be the majority of conversation among the masses.  And everyone says shabbat shalom.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I live in St. Louis, MO and would agree that many of his points hold true here.  After growing up here I attended YU and stayed in NYC for several years and decided to move back for personal reasons.  As I work from home I thought it would offer me the best bang for the buck and a simpler, more wholesome life that is simply impossible in NY.  All that has been true, but I certainly underestimated the spiritual void of not being in a robust Centrist Orthodox community.  Among my peers from childhood, almost nobody else has moved back home &#8211; after experiencing the East Coast (Ivy Leagues, YU, shul choices, kosher options, good jobs in finance) it is simply untenable to come back here.  So the centrist ortho community is declining.  Because of the strong medical community and university presence there is constant influx of young intellectuals and professionals from the East Coast, and many admit to liking it here for many reasons, but it is transient.  Few stay beyond the fellowships, residencies and degree completions.  I sometimes regret making the move myself.  As AS mentions, I am able to compensate with shiurim and chavrutot, mostly among the more haredi group (there are actually some very accomplished and interesting talmidei chachamim here, even if they are mostly chumra sympathizers), and to make the most of online resources such as this forum and regularly engaging with friends back East via email, phone and even regular trips back to NYC. </p>
<p>Unlike AS describes, the centrist ortho crowd here is rather accomplished professionally, a large majority with higher degrees, and most of the youth go on to hesder yeshivot, YU and Ivy Leagues;  however, spirtual dialogue at shabbat tables is mostly saddening.  Most have no idea what goes on back East (of course there are some exceptions), or even that there is  a religious intellectual elite.   Mostly they pride themselves on not being rude and obnoxious New Yorkers who wouldn&#8217;t even asnwer shabbat shalom to a fellow Jew on the way to shul.  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know that this really answers your questions, but...  When I lived in Chicago I did not think in terms of Centrism but I did have several observations:
1- YU was just not important (at least not among the native Chicagoans, but I didn&#039;t really see it as an institutional force in general).
2- &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot; as an ideology was nonexistent.  The non-yeshivish people were distinguishable from the yeshivish primarily via dress, zionism, and attitude towards secular vocations. (most ppl i knew worked, but the &quot;modern&quot; ones were not apologetic about it.)
3- The modern folk had a strong sense of continuity/authenticity.  The older generations remembered the old days when &quot;everyone&quot; was mizrachi, before there was a lakewood kollel, etc.  They also remember that their parents and grandparents were upright jews who wore bathing suits and no sheitels.  
4- There were no academically elitist aspirations.  most of the h.s. grads i met were living at home, going to community colleges or (the smarter ones) mediocre local universities.

So I guess this mostly conforms to AS&#039;s impressions, but I had perhaps a different reaction.  It seemed to me that there would continue to be a community of people who lived approximately the &quot;centrist&quot; way, which they do feel is &quot;authentic,&quot; in a non-ideological fashion.  I thought the irrelevance of YU was a good thing, mostly because I am a fan of local flavor and not a big fan of YU-myopia.  (The question, i guess, is whether that flavor can survive the lakewood onslaught.)   
I should add that what I am describing may be unique to chicago (vs other midwestern places where i think the non-yeshivish element is weaker).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. I&#039;m from Cleveland originally, and the M.O. community there seems vital enough to be pulling in plenty of fresh blood at the present moment (unlike in my youth).

2. Maybe the marketing campaign could be, &quot;Be M.O., and don&#039;t end up like this:

Seriously, tell people the truth, M.O. is a balanced approach to religion and life. It&#039;s not Revivalism, just a healthy approach to Hashem and life that avoids turning you into a crazy person and your society into an underclass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t take a position regarding Centrism in general, as I live far away from the US, and in the US, only knew the New York area, but definitely, the semi-official motto of Centrism, Torah uMadda, is elitist.
