You forget the attitude of some of the middle aged [orthodox] participants: 
My teenage daughter will be married by the time she finishes Stern; there is no way in hell she will be living on the UWS in ten years. Therefore this is not relevant to me or my community. It was like they were covering their eyes and ears and doing the hear no evil see no evil dance - albeit with more bluster and less dancing.]]></description>

To their credit, the orthodox forum did actually invite 20 somethings to discuss when the topic was sexuality. The problem was their being told to speak in euphemism - to say intimacy and not sex, and that only the good and basically pure were invited.]]></description>
