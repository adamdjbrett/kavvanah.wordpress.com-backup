where in the Or hahayyim? What page in Faur? Be specific for both. Why does this spirit possession definition speak definition speak to you in 2010? Do you live in a world of spirits?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry. I did not understand what you had meant. I thought i would just say over my idea about idolatry. But as for Rav Hirsh it seems not all that much based on the any Talmudic passage that  i can remember. And Rebbi Nachman did not go much into any definition of idolatry that i can remember. It is just that i have been a bit bothered by what i see in breslov and so i have tried to figure out some type of definition myself. I was helped along to my definition by jose faur and a passage in the or hachaim]]></description>

A spirit into an object is part of the Picatrix tradition, pseudo Ibn Ezra - it had a new lease in the Early modern period and then found it way into Kabbalah and Hasidut. I am looking for source for Hirsch, not Rav Nachman.I want Rabbinic sources for Hirsch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to clarify: The link I see between R&#039; Hirsch&#039;s understanding of idolatry and R&#039; Leibtag&#039;s reading of what the Later Prophets include in idolatry, is partly indirect. Both sensuality and desiring a material outcome for worship, come together in that the desired result becomes more important than the medium, and thus, the Divine is cut down in size in the mind of the worshiper. However, I do not claim that sensuality itself is not considered idol worship by the prophets.

IOW, I am more interested in demonstrating the Jewish context out of which R&#039; Hirsch formulated his description, than in showing necessarily a precise match.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;The only people who still speak like this are those&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually, the idea is still out there. I have seen a variant of it presented - both in MO and Chareidi contexts - regarding idolizing sports and celebrities, for instance (in fact, I probably used it in a similar way, too). Also, in some ways, some of it can be traced back to the neviim. One of R&#039; Menachem Leibtag&#039;s favorite memes is how much of what Jeremiah calls idol worship is actually a kind of worship of God, but done in a foreign way. Particularly, he traces a development whereby Isaiah and Jeremiah try to wean late First Temple Israel from a quasy-pagan I-serve-God-to-bribe-Him-so-he&#039;ll-be.on-my-side attitude, towards an I-serve-Go-because-under-the-covenant-it-is-my-responsibility-to-champion-justice-and-equity attitude. R&#039; Leibtag&#039;s reading of the sources is very reasonable and straightforward.

I also recognize some influence from medeaeval philosophy, tough I can&#039;t chapter and verse it right now.

So, I&#039;d like to qualify what you write by saying that it&#039;s not that R&#039; Hirsch&#039;s conception of idol worship is made up of predominantly period attitudes, but rather, that he took some more timeless attitudes, but combined them and argued for them in a way that is thoroughly a product of his time. Thus, I recognize that his tremendous emphasis on the dangers of sensuality (Sinnlichkeit) is a particular recurring feature in his writings.]]></description>
