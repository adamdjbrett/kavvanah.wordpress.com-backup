					<description><![CDATA[I do not think Lazier and O&#039;Regan are the propaeduetic you are looking for.
If you want an Intro to Gnosticism I would be looking at Baur, Jonas and Blumenberg on one side and Michael Allen William&#039;s fine book on the historical phenomena on the other side.  And I think you are missing the polyvalence of the term by using this restrictive idea of heresy or turn away from a biblical God. Gnosticism is an entire cultural diagnosis or red herring on one hand or a heresiological diagnosis or red herring on the other. I will refer you to the quote from Culiano featured so prominently in Lazier&#039;s book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, that&#039;s better, but it still seems condescending. I don&#039;t know that Art would say he turned from the &quot;Biblical God&quot; to pantheism because it made him more comfortable.  I think he&#039;d say, rather, that he progressed from dualism to monism because it was where the process took him.

I haven&#039;t read Jay&#039;s book, but I used to subscribe to Zeek and have read some of his articles, and I think he&#039;d probably say the same.]]></description>

I&#039;ll have to take your word about Scholem, but I have trouble imagining Art Green saying that pantheism is some sort of first step toward patriarchy. To the contrary, his view has always seemed to be the reverse. I think it&#039;s a foregone conclusion that Jay would say the same about his position.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;The function of the gnosticism is that people are more comfortable with the starting point that God is a tree or a silkworm than an omniscient patriarch.&lt;/i&gt;

a summation of the views of one or more of these others, or your own opinion?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I still dont get ya. Both Art Green and Jay Michaelson among others explain their turn away from the Biblical God to the what Scholem calls gnosticissm or Green calls pantheism. I am not advocating either the turn or the explanation.
What I am advocating is that if one wants to seriously engage Green for a response, the process needs to start with the ground issues presented by Lazier and then analysed on the Catholic side by Cyril o&#039;Regan.]]></description>

It seems that you (and Scholem) are describing pantheism (or panentheism) rather than gnosticism, but, in any case,  it&#039;s reminiscent of the apologetic arguments of kiruv people or evangelicals - &quot;They aren&#039;t ready for pure monotheism&quot; (my Chabadnik nephew utilizes that one), or &quot;They don&#039;t want to be held accountable by their creator&quot;.]]></description>

Rabbi, do you really see it as being that simple? In making this statement, you&#039;re dismissing a large part of the vast corpus of Indian philosophy as being primitive or childish - certainly inferior to Jewish theology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are talking at cross purposes. I thought the topic was how to avoid relativism and find consistent and plausible rules and principles to guide our behavior. The quest for such principles is indeed senseless if we accept a nihilist celebration of the will. So the plausible answer is, avoid nihilism. End of story. I asked why reject nihilism  by relying on speculative metaphysical ideas like panentheism or Gnosticism. There is no one holding a gun to our head requiring us to act in evil ways. Why do we need any stories about the divine before we can decide that murder is a no no. I then tried to offer a background explanation.
It turns out the topic is how to create a minimum theology when people no longer have vivid ideas about God. As such we have already decided we need some narrative about God appropriate for a secular age. Somehow we have religious sensibilities, but we’re out some coherent story. If that’s the topic my comment is irrelevant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The book was an 81 PHD and the Hebrew came out in 1990. I remember when in the 1980&#039;s he was often on TV debating against the Rav Zvi Yehudah interpretation. It argued for a universal, ethical and mystical Rav Kook and de-emphasized the role of war, politics, and the nation. It was the start of looking at the editorial hand of a given passage. 

It was before the reception of the shemonah kevatzim and all the early writings.  Now, readers find multiples messages and they look for development, and look to identify the restrictive turns taken by Rav Kook. For some of the current flood of scholarly debate, you may want to read Rosenak, Garb, Mirsky, and Gutel.
And for a bit junior,  Udi Avramovitch, Smadar Cherlow, Hannah Kehat, and Bitty Yehudah. 
If one leaves the library and goes to shul then compare Rav Cherlow to Rav Tau on Eyn Ayyah. The former uses Benny Ish Shalom as one of his building blocks. 
You should know that Yehudah Mirsky is working on an English volume about Rav Kook.]]></description>
