				<p>Yoske Achituv who died two weeks ago was the last of the German born Orthodox leaders of the Religious Kibbutz movement. Most of the reigns of leadership had been pasted to others in the early 1990&#8217;s and most of Achituv&#8217;s colleagues, even younger ones, have already passed away. I first meet him in the 1980&#8217;s and in the last decades he was a known figure in the religious academic circles. <a href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%99%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91">His wiki pag</a>e has a nice list of his writings and articles about him.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/yehudah-mirsky.html">the Yehudah Mirsky</a> tribute <a href="http:///www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/15/the-religious-zionist-you-didn-t-know.html">on Open Zion</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Yosef Achituv, known to one and all as Yoske, was a slight man, whose unfailingly gentle soft-spokenness, vaguely luftmenschlich air and easy benevolence were almost comically at odds with the power of his intellect and moral clarity, and the depth of his passions. Born in Germany in 1933 he came as an infant with his family, studied in a Haredi yeshiva and religious Zionist high school, and, in the course of his army service in the early 1950s joined Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, in the south near Ashkelon, where he lived, worked and taught for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Almost all the religious kibbutzim are inside the Green Line, and are regularly been lonely redoubts of moderation in the religious Zionist camp.</p>
<p>The religious kibbutz movement as a whole, Ha-Kibbutz Ha-Dati, is an insufficiently-known side of the Zionist story, one very much worth telling, even, or especially, now that Yoske is gone.</p>
<p>While religious Zionism was historically driven by the moderate, statist, bourgeois Mizrachi movement, and later by the redemptive messianism of the latter-day followers of Rav Kook, the Kibbutz Ha-Dati, founded in the interwar years, drew on different cultural sources: the moral pathos of Samson Rafael Hirsch&#8217;s German neo-Orthodoxy, the fervent existentialism of Polish Hasidism that stamped the Religious Workers&#8217; Party, Ha-Po&#8217;el Ha-Mizrachi, and, later, (in the person of leading thinker Eliezer Goldman) a mix of Maimonidean rationalism and American-style pragmatism, all leavened with a healthy mistrust of authority. Yoske was shaped by all these currents, while reworking them by his own lights in endless teaching (to both young people and adults) one major volume, dozens of studies and hundreds of essays. I could go on at length about his ideas, but three key themes will have to do for now.</p>
<p>First, he understood Judaism, community-building and education in terms of one another. Thus Judaism is about forging a range of dynamic spaces that counter the &#8220;arousal culture,&#8221; as he put it, of consumerism, fostering individual flourishing and mutual responsibility, in a never-ending lifelong process of education that &#8220;creates the human atmosphere befitting the ability to serve God and keep His mizvot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, humility. Yoske&#8217;s personality was inseparable from his ideas, and he was as humble in lifestyle and deportment as he was about what religious teachings and Zionism could and couldn&#8217;t claim or achieve. In recent years, the traditional term for modest restraint, tzniut, has (in many circles) become a watchword for policing women&#8217;s bodies. But Yoske took on this discourse with patience, calm and erudition, arguing against the objectification of women by ad agencies and rabbis both. Modesty, he maintained, is moral education—It’s about how we consume as much as how we discipline our desires.</p>
<p>Third, he railed against the transformation in religious Zionism of the land and people of Israel into metaphysical abstractions that crush human beings. This was another front in his struggle with objectification. In a sense, he thought Religious Zionist theology went both too far and not far enough. Too far in essentializing, reifying living, breathing realities into inhuman abstractions, and not far enough in recognizing that Zionism is a genuine revolution, a new situation— one of Jewish sovereignty, internal and external diversity, and newfound power—that requires a critical deep reinterpretation of traditional concepts and categories in terms of human equality from within the halakhic process itself. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/15/the-religious-zionist-you-didn-t-know.html">Read the rest here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>From Avi Sagi&#8217;s Eulogy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yoska was all about compassion and caring for others. He never asked anything for himself. He was content with his lot, and this contentment found expression in an absence of want. His unique goodness was demonstrated precisely in the way that goodness should be &#8211; giving to others and caring for them. Even during his illness, he always, always, thought about others &#8211; his wife Yaffa, may she live and be well, his children, grandchildren, friends, the kibbutz, religious Zionism, the State, and every person suffering. Because he was a loving, compassionate man. He thought about everyone but himself. He was the kind of man who was a rock for everyone during hard times and good times.</p>
<p>Yoska’s direct interest was to mend religious Zionism, which he was an integral part of him.<br />
Yet his work strove towards an even further horizon: mending the entire society. He wanted to return the special synthesis between religion and humanism to Israeli society in general and religious Zionism in particular as well as the profound respect for all of God’s creatures regardless of religion, gender, political or national orientation, or skin color. This respect was not an empty concept, and if it was empty then it is we who are empty.</p>
<p>This respect is demonstrated in his recognition of the equal value of all mortals, and a courageous stand against attempts to exclude women, or to hurt non-Jews, strangers, and those who are struggling and suffering. The man was a Jewish religious humanist. And as opposed to Leibowitz who saw a contradiction between humanism and Torah, Yoska believed that humanism is the very foundation of Torah and any other position is a desecration of God’s name.<br />

				<p>This year was the 4th annual U.S. Jewish/Evangelical Encounter. One of the senior Evangelical participants Prof. Jay Phelan, formerly President and Dean of North Park Theological Seminary, <a href="http://additionalmarkings.blogspot.com/">posted his talk on his blog. </a>The paper is long, I posted the relgious aspects and left out most of the political aspects; you can <a href="http://additionalmarkings.blogspot.com/">read the rest at his blog. </a>Any thoughts and feedback for him? Any observations?</p>
<p><strong>How Not to Criticize Israel: Guidelines for Conversations between Evangelicals and Jews</strong><br />
John E. Phelan, Jr. North Park Theological Seminary</p>
<p>Evangelical Christians have for years been dependable supporters of the state of Israel.  Dispensationalist interpreters saw the reconstitution of the state in 1948 as a fulfillment of prophecy and a clear sign that the return of Jesus was at hand.  Throughout the following decades Israel could count on Evangelicals to support the state in the voting booth as well as from the pulpit.  This support, of course, was not new.  Zionists found support for their cause in the late 19th and early 20th century from Christian students of prophecy who were convinced the fulfillment of God’s purposes required a Jewish state in their ancient homeland.  In the early decades of the 20thcentury pastors, theologians, and Christian politicians enthusiastically promoted the cause of a Jewish homeland.  In many circles to this day it is unthinkable for an Evangelical to criticize or question the state of Israel.</p>
<p>In recent years things have begun to change.  Many Evangelicals have been sensitized to the sufferings and struggles of the Palestinians—particularly Palestinian Christians.  At the same time, Dispensationalism has fallen into disfavor in many Evangelical circles.  For many the state of Israel is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of prophecy and the Jews’ return to the land is no longer seen as a reason for celebration.  Evangelical Christians committed to social justice have joined their colleagues in mainline Protestant churches in criticizing Israel over the plight of the Palestinians.  Its Christian critics now frequently depict Israel as just one more oppressive colonial power in the Middle East.  Supporting Israel has become as unthinkable for some Evangelicals as supporting cuts in government support of the poor!</p>
<p>Israel is a state like any other.  It has had good leaders and poor ones.  It has made wise decisions and foolish ones.  It is as subject to criticism as Egypt, Iraq or the United States&#8230; Conversations between Evangelicals and Jews over the perceived failures of the state of Israel are fairly new.  In what follows some principles of engagement are proposed that may enable those conversations to be helpful rather than hurtful.</p>
<p><strong>Principle One: Evangelicals should not criticize the state of Israel by questioning the legitimacy of Judaism itself.</strong></p>
<p> Some Evangelical criticism of Israel has come by way of a critique of so-called “Christian Zionism.”  Such criticism is intended to break the hold that Dispensationalist thinkers have had on Evangelical conversations about Israel and Judaism.  Unfortunately, when critics launch salvoes at the popular dispensationalist approaches to the interpretation of the Bible the Jews are caught in the crossfire.  It is popular to argue against the Christian Zionists, for example, by suggesting that the Jews no longer have any right to the land of Israel in that Christians are now the sole heirs of all the promises to Abraham.  Some have gone as far as to say this means the Palestinian Christians are the true heirs of the land of Israel—not the Jews (or the Muslims, for that matter).</p>
<p> In making their case against the Christian Zionists and for the Christian Palestinians these Evangelical critics of Israel have perhaps inadvertently launched an attack on Judaism itself.  Their approach implies not only that Jews no longer have a right to the land of Israel, but also that they no longer have a right to interpret their own holy texts.  Christians are now entrusted with the stewardship of the Jewish scriptures and their meaning.  This amounts to a Christian colonization of Jewish texts and traditions.  To many Jews this sounds like the Jews, not simply Israel, have no right to exist.  This is not simply an attack on their homeland but on their core convictions about their identity and purpose as God’s people.  Given the ugly history of Christian and Jewish relations such approaches sound a warning bell for even the most secular Jew! </p>
<p>Christian scholars have in recent years been engaged in serious discussions of “supersessionism” or “replacement” theories.  In its crudest form supersessionism holds that the people of Israel have simply been superseded by the church of Jesus Christ and therefore have no claim on their own texts, traditions or future.  This conversation is not a new one. The future of the people of Israel as Israel was an issue that deeply troubled the apostle Paul.  Some argue that the entire book of Romans is dedicated to exploring this issue.  When Paul discusses this directly in Romans 9-11 he begins by arguing “they are[note the present tense] Israelites.  The adoption as God’s children, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the worship and the promises belongto them.”  A bit later he insists, “God did not reject his people whom he foreknew.”  He concludes his argument with the startling assertion: “All Israel will be saved.”  It seems clear that Paul, at least, did not think that with the founding of the Christian church God’s promises to and love for Israel, as Israel had become passé.  Paul, it seems to many of us, foresaw a future for Israel as Israel.</p>
<p>  The upshot of all this is that Evangelicals would do well to avoid using theological arguments to criticize the state of Israel.  Such theological arguments may be heard as at least indirect attacks on Jews and Judaism. This will, to say the least, not foster helpful conversations.  It is certainly fair to criticize Israel where its actions are demonstrably unjust and contrary to its own laws and principles, but it is frankly anti-Jewish to criticize Israel by implying Jews, as Jews have no right to land or a future.  Evangelical critics of Israel need to recognize how painfully this rings in Jewish ears.  Evangelicals implying that Israel, as a Jewish state, has no right to exist will not improve the situation of the Palestinians.</p>
<p><strong>Principle Two: Criticisms of the State of Israel must be grounded in an understanding of the history of the region and a fair assessment of its contemporary challenges.</strong></p>
<p>The history of this region did not begin with the construction of the separation fence and wall or even with the foundation of the state in 1948.  The conflicts between Israel’s Jews and their neighbors did not begin with the first Intifada. Israel’s critics need to remember that the Jews did not simply take the land in the war of independence but were promised a homeland by the Balfour Declaration of 1917.  The British, anticipating the fall of the Ottoman Empire declared that they viewed “with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.”  The declaration became part of the peace treaty with Turkey after the war.  Following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire with the help of the British, Arabs, long under the thumb of the Ottoman Empire and European colonial powers, established several large states in North Africa and the Middle East.  The Jews, in spite of assurances from the British, faced a long and bitter struggle to see their promised homeland established. </p>
<p>Years ago the American Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, a supporter of the creation of the state of Israel, argued that justice could only be relative in the Middle East&#8230;   </p>
<p><strong>Third Principle: Conversations between Evangelicals and Jews about Israel and Judaism must recognize and acknowledge foundational disagreements between and shared ignorance of one another.</strong></p>
<p>Evangelicals should not assume they understand contemporary Jews and Judaism.  They may know the Hebrew Scriptures well.  They may be well versed on the Pharisees and Sadducees of Jesus’ day.  They may imagine that because they understand Paul’s critiques of his Jewish contemporaries, that they understand and may critique their Jewish contemporaries.  Such assumptions are fatal to dialogue.  The key to any useful dialogue is to let the dialogue partner speak for him or herself!  It is not for Evangelical Christians to tell Jews what they believe.  Nor, of course, is it the place of Jews to tell Christians, evangelical or otherwise, what they believe.  Dialogue always begins with listening.  Evangelicals should let their Jewish partners tell their own stories and vice versa.  In these conversations the differences will emerge and be acknowledged soon enough! </p>
<p>Careful listening will reveal that there are many religious, political, and theological differences within the respective Jewish and Evangelical communities!  There are a variety of opinions within both camps regarding the politics and practices of the state of Israel.  There are significant disagreements regarding how the texts and traditions of Judaism and Christianity are to be applied to living in the modern world.  But whatever the differences, there is in many if not most Jews a fierce commitment to endurance the Jewish people.  A bitter history of pogroms and the Holocaust has bound many Jews, both religious and secular, to the land of Israel.  Here, if nowhere else, in a Jewish homeland, Jews can be safe to live as Jews and practice their traditions well, poorly, or not at all! For many Jews the state of Israel is an assurance of a Jewish future.  Evangelicals cannot pretend to understand fully or appreciate what it means to the survivors of centuries of violence and hostility to find a safe home in the land of Israel. </p>
<p>Jews and Christians view differently the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.  They view differently the role of Torah in the life of an individual and community.  They regard the same texts as the authoritative word of God but read them through a very different set of lenses.  Their sense of “peoplehood” is very different.  Only if Evangelicals and Jews listen to one another and learn from one another over time will they begin to understand their varied convictions and commitments. </p>
<p> In spite of their many differences, Evangelical Christians and Jews still have a great deal in common and profound reasons to listen to and learn from one another.  Evangelical Christians and Jews worship the same God—the God of the Jews—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  This is the God who calls all Jews and Christians, “to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8b).  And whatever their differences with Jews over Israel, Evangelical Christians who hold authoritative the words of the Apostle Paul should be concerned that the Jewish people have a future, believing the Jews beloved of God and that “the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.”</p>
<p><strong>Principle Four: Evangelicals should criticize Israel as friends of Israel.</strong></p>
<p>Criticism from those hostile to the state of Israel and critical of its very existence are certainly less well received than that of critics committed to a just a safe future for Israel and its Jews.  Any criticism that is not founded on Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state may sound like an attack on the very survival of the Jews.  Criticism grounded in love is more easily borne that criticism rooted in hostility.  </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I checked my stats the other day and my post from six months ago on <a href="../../2012/01/15/rav-soloveitchik-speaks-to-mental-health-professionals-1978/index.html">“Rav Soloveitchik to Mental Health Professionals 1978”</a> has unbeknownst to me slowly turned into my most read post, with a score of readers every day.  So, I decided to do a few more.  Let me know in the comments, what is the attraction?</p>
<p>The lecture “Religious Definitions of Man and his Social Institutions part 1of 7 (1958),” was the start of Rav Soloveitchik’s working out his Existential thoughts. His early writings from the 1940s consisted of epistemology, a comparison of Torah to science, the creation of a Halakhic intellectualism, and ways to be this worldly.  In 1958, Rav Soloveitchik started working out his response to existentialism, psychology, and the role of the individual. He did this by taking notes on books which he thought were important and offered his comments. The books he used will reveal themselves in the course of these lectures. These seven lectures were refined into the single lecture of Lonely Man of Faith (1966) and some of the material was used in other lectures from 1967-1974.  For any future articles on Rav Soloveitchik and Lonley Man of Faith, these seven lectures are essential tools to show what motivated his thinking: they elaborate his thought, they explicate his sources, and by contrast they show what his final resolution in 1966 rejected. </p>
<p>This time, the year was 1958. Camus won the Nobel Prize in 1957; Existentialism was reaching the U.S. and the existentialism of film noir just ended. Existentialism grappled with many aspects of human condition including: anxiety, anguish, dread, despair, boredom, guilt, loneliness, forlornness, lack of meaning, self-deception, suicide, death, suffering, and finitude.<br />
During this time, WSSW – YU’s social work school had just opened.  Tradition, the Orthodox journal was just founded and sought to offer theological Orthodoxy to compete with the journals- Conservative Judaism, Commentary, and Judaism. Will Herberg together with Niebuhr started a rice of theology in America, a half dozen years prior to the Orthodox taking up the banner. Modernity as a problem of alienation and loneliness was already in the curriculum. The 1950 classic, The Lonely Crowd by David Reisman et al., was accepted and in it included its wisdom that society dominated by the outer-directed social oriented people leads to profound deficiencies in leadership, individual self-knowledge, and human potential.  But Rav Soloveitchik is more literary. Albert Camus thought &#8220;it is in solitude and loneliness that we find the threads that bind us together in community.&#8221; For Kierkegaard, loneliness gave his soul depth. If we are willing to be present to ourselves in loneliness, then we will learn who we are. Lecture II in this series is entirely about loneliness. (If anyone know the exact details of to whom the lecture was given, please let me know).</p>
<p>We have to thank David Etengoff for transferring the lectures to mp3 and uploading them. <a href="http://www.box.com/s/7vpxhzhg2ekrid9e5fb4/4/129360005/1004276061/1">Here is the lecture.</a></p>
<p>Don’t take my word for what the Rav says, listen to it yourself. If you have never heard a full shiur from Rav Soloveitchik then this lecture will show you what the Rav was. No Gadol in 1958 (or even now) would have spent his time grappling with the high culture and existential thought of the era. Notice how non-halakhic the lecture is and how he turns instead to theology. This lecture will remind you why people were attracted to Rav Soloveitchik. Please correct me if I heard anything incorrectly. I do not intend to mediate your direct encounter with his lecture so I have left many of his statements as first person and placed my commentary in brackets.</p>
<p>Part I- This talk is subjective. There is no truth or objectivity in Jewish thought and theology.<br />
Part II-Every Religion needs a doctrine of man<br />
Part III-God for us is both the hidden God and the God of closeness and dialogue.<br />
Part IV-Need to bring this to the masses, too elite for most. Discussion of the Trinity</p>
<p><strong>Part I- Subjectivity</strong><br />
Rav Soloveitchik opens with the drama of his role as a humble teacher. He requests to be interrupted and liked it when students had questions.</p>
<p>He states that he is not trained in theology or religious philosophy. But the questions of Heidegger – and religious philosophy were all around the university. He says that there are many theological problems but very few answers. Rav Soloveitchik admits that he is eclectic. <strong>He says, “I am not laying claim to any theological validity”  and “I don’t know if it is true or not.” For theology, we cannot be right or wrong since we have no laboratory to test what we say or even any objective tests</strong>. He offers only his subjective thoughts, his subjective experience and his subjective understanding of modern man. </p>
<p>“I am not trying to convince anyone – I lack missionary zeal.” Whatever I do it is as a lack of confidence on my part. I am confessing and sharing. If it is not commensurate with your experience or incongruent with them. I will not feel hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Whoever makes an authoritative statement about Jewish philosophy is wrong . We have no method to determine which Jewish philosopher is correct.</strong>  It is all a matter of interpretation.</p>
<p>[Notice that right at the start he is not claiming his lecture is the truth, nor is he claiming it is a Torah intuition, or even any expertise. He says it is subjective and just his personal understanding. As you listen to the lecture, note that he is not introducing halakhah to the gentile world, nor is he introducing philosophy to Jews.  His goal, as it was in many other lectures, was to raise Judaism to the highest levels of culture and to answer the intellectual problems of the age.  In 2012, it would be Habermas, Taylor, and Levinas, globalization and the immanent frame of religion- not to teach 18th century science or fight segulot and other gedolim. To turn Jewish thought into halakah or as having a pesak or coming from the theologically untrained is not Rav Soloveitchik. see the writings of Walter Wurzburer for more details.]</p>
<p>Part II-Doctrine of Man<br />
I will deal with the doctrine of man. Every civilized religion has a philosophy of religion, by this I mean Christianity and Islam. </p>
<p>Cognition is main motif that shapes religious experience. Homo Religious is a form of Homo theoretical<br />
Homo Religious needs curiosity, needs to know how to save world.  Many think religion is not a cognitive gesture- like Schleiermacher thought it was emotion, Kant- thought it was volitional-ethical </p>
<p>The Homo Theoretical is bound by finitude and formal equation whereas theHomo Religious is not about discovery, and not interested in the useful or knowledge of reality. Rather, he seeks to order to the universe. If the universe is not knowable then we have resignation. For the Homo Religious every aspect of reality and being – act of resignation<br />
Religion is not to be equated with ignorance or uneducated. <strong>There is no ignorant religion since ignorance and elegance do not go together.</strong> However, Skeptic questioning against knowledge comes from arrogance and ignorance.</p>
<p>Existence that transcends the boundaries of finality must be in confines of temporality- this is Jewish. We meet find God in confines of time and space – unlike medieval Christianity </p>
<p>In the Mechanical order, Homo Religious still need to meet his creator and still falls into bottomless abyss. He struggles with absurdity with the unknown called existence. </p>
<p>Man rebels against god and his authority, then returns too God, who receives him like a child, and to whom his rebellion was like child.</p>
<p>Religious knowledge is not other-worldly, a leap into the unknown or anti-scientific. The cognitive gesture of Homo Religious is mainly concerned with the order of personal existence. He looks into &#8211; himself</p>
<p>The Greeks were theoreticians and lacked practicality. But when it came to what is man? They became practical. They tried to answer: how to be happy? They not did with struggle with self. They became practical and pragmatic.<br />
But modern Homo Religious asks the theoretical question: Who is man? What is his Existential condition? His self awareness?  </p>
<p>Different religions differ in their conceptions of the above described Homo Religious.  “I have very little knowledge of Eastern religion, not even to mention it.”</p>
<p>Most religious systems were metaphysical and developed theosophy doctrines not anthropology. Aquinas had social philosophy and natural law, but no question of man for himself.  Only lately Christianity began to develop – as religious existentialism started producing many books.</p>
<p><strong>Judaism is a very unique position; it is intellectual and also focused on man. In Judaism, anthropology replaced man.  Judaism is about the essence of man never the essence of God. Judaism is theocentric but anthropological oriented.   </p>
<p>God is beginning and end of everything; &#8211; if we are not focused on God, then why spend so much money on our institutions?</strong></p>
<p>[In Halakhic Man, the religious man and the cognitive man were separate. Here we have an assumption that religious man is a version of cognitive man. Notice the use of the term “theoretical man” which reflects his own view of Judaism.]<br />
[His category formation is still early twentieth century, with its post-Hegelian concern for the triad of God, man, and world. If you want to know more, see the Baden Neo-Kantian, Richard Kroner, <em>Speculation and Revelation In Modern Philosophy</em> (1961). Similarity, pre-WWI is his wanted to definitely decide between thought, volition, and emotion.  Works like Joachim Wach’s <em>The Comparative Study of Religions</em> dedicate their first chapter to stating that the phenomena of religion have all three, even if religious thinkers want to choose one over another.] [Notice how far this intellectualism is from Centrist emotionalism and volitionalism or skepticism toward theology.]</p>
<p>[ I was glad to see that in these tapes, the Rav distinguishes between medieval and modern Christianity. In contrast, his writings almost always use the phrase Christianity when he only means the medieval variety. This always bothered me since the very Christian books on his desk were rejecting and disassociating themselves from the medieval versions. I wonder where the editorial change came in?] </p>
<p>[After the existential revolt, Rav Soloveitchik does not envision anything Sisyphus or Promethean as one would expect from the Camus language. Rather, the Rav offers reconciliation with God like a parent accepts his child who went away. There are echoes of Christian reconciliation in that description.]</p>
<p>Part III- <strong>Rav Soloveitchik’s God</strong><br />
In Judaism, God himself is the hidden God, Jal Mistatar – unknowable and unknown. <strong>The Jewish experience of God (shared by other religions is antithetic, a polarity.  it has both remoteness and intimate closeness.</strong>  How is that possible? Judaism does not use Aristotelian logic of excluded middle.  Unlike classic physic, modern physics uses both waves and particles; modern physics does not use Aristotle. God is both remote and close- in our encounter we are bewildered and comforted. Since Creation is also revelation, the every tree also incomprehensible strange. </p>
<p>When Jacob was wresting with God, just the night before he spoke to Him with intimacy.  That is the dichotomy of greatness and magnificence followed by struggle and darkness. The Individual Homo Religious has a life of paradox. Judaism has the greatest book of the religious experience- and everyone agrees that the author of Psalms was a religious genius. We see the contrast in that in Psalm 23 God is comfort and security and then in Psalm 24.  We are searching for God and cannot find Him.</p>
<p> [Rav Soloveitckik removes all kavod theories, therefore no kisse hakavod or shekhinah, no emanation or kabbalah. There is also no relationship based on the metaphors of king-subject, master-slave, or father-son. Nor is there any direct providence or life with God. Like the Kalam and Kant, we have lost our Chain of Being. Much of this sounds like Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans- the telltale sign was the literary importance of Psalms 23 and 24 used by Barth. Notice that the theology is entirely Biblical. (Wait until the next tape where he explicitly mentions his sources.)]</p>
<p>Part IV-<strong>But this is only for the Few!  Let’s Look at the Trinity</strong></p>
<p>Institutional religion can only be organized on a single idea of God without having a sense of polarity. There is no polarity on communal level. <strong>The religion of the few is not the religion of the many.</strong> It is Incompressible to the many. Some religions emphasize one side of the polarity over the other.</p>
<p><strong>Christianity solved this issue with the Trinity.</strong> They have the distant Father and the closeness of the Son. The scheme of the Father-Son and Trinity was created by the Fathers of the Desert and then later by Augustine. This captures the closeness and distance of God. Son is on earth as mediator, prayer cannot reach God as Father.<br />
In England, in the Anglican Church, everyone is part of the ecclesia, even if run by the few. Religion is not just for the few. Religion not just for philosopher</p>
<p>Means and ways must found to simplify it for everyone—this dichotomy is for the few. </p>
<p>[Wow, I would have never expected an explicit discussion of the Trinity and the comparisons to Judaism. Yet, it makes sense if he has Christian theologians open in front of him and is grappling with the material. We also have an explicit acknowledgement that his thought is for the elite few and he needs to solve it. ]</p>

				<p>This is from GetReligion, a site that watches how the media does not get religion. Here they catch a piece of absurdity where the TV chef Alton Brown says that he is religious and the host Simon does not realize that it means he says grace before he eats. To be religious means one prays, studies scripture, and observes festivals. Most of the Christians that I have worked with or attend meetings with say grace before meals, that goes without saying. But what I find interesting is that religious Jews have the same flabbergasted sense when a Christian says they are religious that it may mean they prayer before eating, attend daily services, or say evening prayers. It seems Jews are wedded to the false dichotomy that Judaism is are deeds and Christianity is creed. Even modern orthodox Jews dont realize that the attorney, doctor or real estate broker who say he or she is a religious Christian prays before eating and attends services?</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.getreligion.org/2012/05/where-prayers-and-food-preparation-meet/">May 26, 2012 &#8211; SCOTT SIMON, HOST:</a></p>
<p>This Memorial Day weekend, many Americans will fire up a grill to cook dogs or burgers, tuna, zucchini or tofu. That’s our focus as we begin the occasional WEEKEND EDITION series all about seasonal food and drink called Taste of Summer. Alton Brown joins us now, the food historian and scientist. He’s best known for his award-winning Food Network show “Good Eats” and for hosting “Iron Chef America.” He’s currently one of the celebrity chef mentors on the reality competition “Food Network Star.”</p>
<p>SIMON: Let me ask you a question that doesn’t have anything to do with grilling but has a lot to do with you, while we have the chance.</p>
<p>BROWN: OK.</p>
<p>SIMON: You say grace before a meal?</p>
<p>BROWN: I do. Yeah. I say grace. I’m a big believer in grace. I happen to believe in a God that made all the food and so I’m pretty grateful for that and I thank him for that. But I’m also thankful for the people that put the food on the table.</p>
<p>The people that grew the food, the people that got the food to me. I think that being grateful, being thankful, makes food tastes better, actually, and it’s something that we should take time to do. I do.</p>
<p>SIMON: Might be a good thing to remember on a weekend like this, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>BROWN: Might be.</p>
<p>GetRelgion- I also got a kick out of how the host says the question doesn’t have anything at all whatsoever to do with grilling. (How does he know?) And then he says it does have a lot to do with Alton Brown.<br />
But after the piece was sent along, it did kind of remind me how weird it can be to be a Christian — or religious adherent who thanks a deity in prayer — in this media environment. I mean, when I think of my family members, the people </p>
<p>I go to church with and almost every other Christian I know at the level of having eaten with them, we all say prayers before our meals. It’s something that happens before every single meal. It’s completely typical to the point that if I went over to a Christian friend’s house and we didn’t pray before eating, it would be seriously weird.</p>
<p>And yet the subtext in some media environments, I can’t help but notice, is that praying before a meal is the abnormal or atypical thing worth asking a question about. It’s just kind of interesting, isn’t it?<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Why should a Jew become a Mormon? Ask Marlena</p>
<p>Posted by Mark Paredes</p>
<p>The proverbial “third rail” issue for a Christian blogger on a Jewish website is Jewish conversion to Christianity. It is one of the few issues that unites practically all Jews, and well-funded organizations (e.g., Jews for Judaism) have been set up to keep Jews from converting.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago a prominent Jewish leader asked me why Jews decide to become Mormons. I decided to pose a series of questions to my friend Marlena Tanya Muchnick, a well-known Jew-turned-Mormon speaker, author, and researcher.</p>
<p>Q: How old were you when you converted to the LDS Church?</p>
<p>A: I often contemplated the gifts promised the human family in the Tree of Life mentioned in Genesis 2. The Hebrew life giving tree motif I found in a copy of Kabbalah (esoteric Judaic writings). It stirred in me a deep curiosity about the mysterious connections of all things in earth and heaven. I read of covenants, oaths, the patterns and behaviors of men –blessings received, curses endured. Always the connection of God to His children was tested and tried. The Hebrew people have always been engaged in a love story (often also a tryst!) with their Father/Lord. So, in a fashion, I was being spiritually prepared for my transformation at age 47 – from Orthodox/Conservative Jewess to a temple-attending Latter-day Saint.</p>
<p>Q: Jews believe the Abrahamic covenant still applies to them. Mormons also believe that the Abrahamic covenant is applicable today. Why is there a need for a Jew to become a Mormon if the Abrahamic covenant is still alive and well?</p>
<p>A: Being raised an observant Jewess, I trusted that the everlasting Avrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12, 15, 17, and 28) was the blueprint for every life. An agreement between mankind and God, it is unconditional in its nature to bless the tribes of Israel (see Genesis 12:2-3). Nations and kings were to descend from that patriarch who would become father of a “great nation”, receiving special blessings for their faithfulness, including the Mashiach’s (Messiah’s) return into their midst. Many Jews believe in these future events but have little idea of the profound meanings implicit in them. Spiritual truth often lies in mystery, but to ignore that tantalizing search is to remain dead to the potential for life that waits hopefully within each soul.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, through the teachings of the missionaries, I discovered that Mormons understand covenants better than anyone, because they realize the importance and urgency of gathering members of the house of Israel through the restored, latter-day Gospel teachings as reintroduced through the Prophet Joseph Smith; his translation of the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the restoration of the temples of God to the earth.</p>
<p>Jews are the “chosen” people according to God’s covenant with Abraham, but they became scattered and drifted into anonymity through intermarriage and abandonment of their traditions and religion. Abraham wanted to regain the true priesthood and gospel principles that had been lost through apostasy. But neither the Jews nor anyone else can be automatically saved. The Latter-day Saints have been charged with finding those who are lost and teaching them the essential news of the restoration of ancient priesthood powers which God has covenanted to them unconditionally on His part. But individual faithfulness and action are required to bring fulfillment. Judaism is the foundation of Christianity, not the final product.</p>
<p>Q: What was it that attracted you to Mormonism?</p>
<p>During my growing years as a female in a traditionally male cultural setting, I sought in the synagogues for a deeper and especially a personal solace. Jews do not focus on personal prayer. Synagogue prayers are praises to God and petitions for Israel &#8211; our traditional way of approaching Deity. But I needed a personal witness. Finally, pleading with God before the opened Torah scrolls, I challenged Him to bring me what He knew I needed; then I determined to find it myself, if it took this lifetime to do so.  It took several years longer.</p>
<p>My only sibling, a younger brother, eventually accepted the Gospel more or less against his will. Mark had married a Tongan whose father translated the Book of Mormon into Tongan for the country’s royalty. Mark’s wife and family were, of course, devoted Mormons.  In 1975, he brought me a Book of Mormon, to share the joy in the Gospel that he had found. I immediately rejected it.“I have Torah. Why would I need another book? No, thanks. I prefer to remain a Jew. Is this what our people have fought to become?  I think not.”</p>
<p>1. I found those Mormons I met and who befriended me to be genuinely caring about each and every person and were gentle and forgiving folk. They were genuinely kind to me and they related all their life experiences to faith and love of God and Christ. What impressed me so much was their close relationship with God. That gave them satisfaction I had only dreamt of finding. They listened to my denials of Christ, asked me about Judaism, and were genuinely interested in comparing religions through scripture and through their own understanding. And then there was the “look” in their eyes. Was it joy? True happiness? Their constant relationship with the mysterious Holy Spirit? I wanted it!</p>
<p>4. I was attracted to the notion that prophets and seers were once again on the earth. In Torah many prophets are mentioned, some true, some false.  The greater ones were usually disbelieved and hated for their unpopular messages. Some met with an untimely death. The last Hebrew prophet, Malachi, lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. Judaism today does not recognize anyone as having the voice to speak for them. But the Mormons claim Joseph Smith was a prophet and seer and that these chosen men of God will never again be taken from the earth. Thomas S. Monson is regarded as the current seer and prophetic voice among the Saints and he has two counselors. Together they form the First Presidency of the church. Their writings, in my mind, equal and often surpass those of many scholarly Talmudic sages.</p>
<p>5. The Mormon view of the afterlife attracted me greatly. Jews believe there is an Olam Haba – the world to come after death. Torah emphasizes immediate, concrete, physical rewards and punishments rather than abstract future ones. See, for example, Lev. 26:3-9 and Deut. 11:13-15. However, there is clear evidence in Torah of belief in existence after death. Indicated in several places the righteous with their loved ones will be reunited after death, while the wicked will be excluded. Ideas about resurrection and reincarnation are accepted, but there is much room for personal opinion, because Torah does not mention this subject directly, though the early temples practiced cleansing and vivifying rites. I was very concerned with what hope there was for mine and my family’s death. Mormons have revealed knowledge through prophets that explains and clarifies much about the spirit world before and after mortal life, and I found it reassuring.</p>
<p>Q: According to one of your websites, you engaged in five months of “secluded studying” of Hebrew and LDS scriptures before converting. What did you learn from this experience?</p>
<p>1. I learned about the priesthood of God, its purposes, duties and ministrations. See Exodus 40, a detailed account of Aaron and his sons receiving the Aaronic priesthood. After the fall of Herod’s Temple in 70 AD, that and the greater priesthood were lost, the Jewish nation scattered. In these latter days that most precious gift has been restored to the earth and all of us are blessed through the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthood of God in these latter days.</p>
<p>7. The Book of Mormon opened my eyes to profound teachings, truths about the history of my Hebrew ancestors in the Americas, the true nature of the spirit of mankind, Jesus in America.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve written “A Mormon’s Guide to Judaism.“What is one thing that every Mormon should know about Judaism? What should every Jew know about Mormonism?</p>
<p>It is important for the Jewish people to understand that the ancient tribal identities and relationships have been restored; that those who are descendants of the Hebrews enslaved in Egypt, Babylon, etc. , and now scattered throughout the earth – are in the process of being gathered again, according to ancient prophecy (Isa 54:7, Ezek 11:17, Jer 50:4 and others). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pursues the literal gathering of Israel throughout the world and the restoration of all the tribes (families) of Jacob prior to the coming of the Mashiach. The fullness of the early Gospel taught by our first prophets is here upon the earth today and available to each of us. Without the birthright tribe (holding the priesthood keys through Christ and his church) of Ephraim, the lineage of Judah (protector of the temples and the people) is as a sword of undirected energy.</p>
<p>Q: You speak often on the symbolic connections between Mormon and Jewish worship. What is the most important connection?</p>
<p>A: That is an easy answer. It would be our holy temples, those that once stood in Jerusalem and those built by the Latter-day Saints. It was and is now Beit YHVH or YHWH, the house of the Lord. The history of the temple in Jerusalem begins in 957 BC with King Solomon’s construction. It was destroyed and rebuilt twice more. It was the center of Jewish civilization and all things in life revolved around that holy shrine built to God… The loss of the temple in a.d. 70 brought on the Diaspora of the Jews which has lasted to this day. Jews believe they no longer have a temple in which to worship, but that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Q: Can a person be both Jew and Mormon?</p>
<p>A: To be a technical Jew, it is necessary to be born of the nation and ethnoreligious group that originated in the ancient Near East and which were once Hebrews and before that, Israelites. Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation. Having said that, anyone can choose to embrace the LDS faith (or any other) through investigation, prayer, personal feeling of “rightness” and a spiritual certainty. As we read in Romans 10:12, the same Lord is over all, both Jew and Greek, and they must call upon him. Specifically, I have found it logically and spiritually sound to progress from monotheism to an understanding of the Godhead, to realize the atonement of Christ stands as eternal, replacing the constant sacrificing of innocent animals. I see the progression from ancient to modern prophets, a restored priesthood authority, temples, revealed prophecies, and so on. I cannot deny it.</p>

				<p>Here is an article about Mormons with many affinities to Orthodox issues. If you gave you life to being Mormon or Orthodox, what happens when you have doubts? Remember last year&#8217;s Orthoprax Rabbi blog? The Mormon answer is to create online support groups. The financial pressures, the rising disinterest, the same-sex love issues, the feminism, the opposite sex issues, and the lack of transparency. We have church officials saying the percentages are small and the historians thinking that this is a major exodus. This is not a question of being in the group or out of the group, rather the many who have invested their entire life with the program and dont want to leave their lives broken. The article also notes that need for them to be able to express that they are not going to be written out of the faith no matter what the gatekeepers think. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/mormons-struggling-with-doubt-turn-to-online-support-groups/2012/05/24/gJQASImHnU_story.html">Mormons struggling with doubt turn to online support groups</a><br />
By Michelle Boorstein, Published: May 24</p>
<p>Brian Johnston was desperate. The pressures of raising six children on one accountant salary were crushing, but worse was that he was starting to doubt the entire reason he and his wife had created a big family with a stay-at-home mom in the first place: Their Mormonism.</p>
<p>Johnston’s wife had already left the faith after deciding it was a dangerous cult. He didn’t want to take it that far, but who could he confide in? Raised in a devout home, Johnston remembered rebellious Mormons who lost the right to be Sunday school teachers or to come to community events such as weddings, or who simply felt shunned at church.<br />
His entire life seemed to hang by a thread.</p>
<p>Then late one night in 2007, while sitting at his computer in his suburban Atlanta, Johnston came across an article by a Mormon academic in Arizona whose wife had also left the church. Johnston, a burly former Army technician, e-mailed the man explaining his situation. I have no idea what to do, he said. There’s no one I can talk to. A response came back almost immediately: Hang in there. I know what you’re going through. Johnston’s blue eyes widen when he recalls the relief he felt. “Yes! That’s what I thought. I knew, there must be more, but how do I find them?”</p>
<p>Five years later, Johnston, who now lives in Frederick, has become a leader in an online Mormon world full of people just like himself — questioners. And in an extremely orthodox faith, that’s not a simple place to be. </p>
<p>The Web has become such an important part of Mormon life that Mormons call their social networks the “bloggernacle” — named after the Tabernacle, a famous gathering place in downtown Salt Lake City. With names such as <a href="http://www.feministmormonhousewives.org/">feministmormonhousewives.org,</a> <a href="http://newordermormon.org/">newordermormon.org</a> and Johnston’s <a href="http://www.staylds.com">stayLDS.com,</a> the sites devoted to questioning provide a safe place for Mormons to grapple with topics such as polygamy, institutional racism and a scripture that teaches that Jesus visited the American continent.</p>
<p>Church officials say the growth of the sites does not point to a corresponding growth in the number of Mormons leaving the church, whose membership has burgeoned to more than 6 million inAmerica. “Those leaving the church are a fraction of 1 percent each year and it is a trend that is decreasing rather than increasing,” said Michael Purdy, a church spokesman.</p>
<p> And the church has acknowledged on other occasions that it has had difficulty retaining young Mormons, in particular, and has generally lagged in dealing with doubt — perhaps the largest challenge not only to Mormonism, but also to modern organized religion as a whole.</p>
<p>The official church historian Marlin Jensen made news last year when he said that the loss of members in the last five or 10 years has been greater than perhaps any period since Mormonism was founded in 1830.</p>
<p>The reasons? Society’s increasing secularism plays a role, Jensen said, but also the Mormon church’s failure to openly address questions about church history and doctrine.</p>
<p>Much of that evolution is taking place on the Internet. Every day when Johnston logs into stayLDS.com, a site for people in spiritual crisis, he says he feels he is saving his faith by encouraging the questioning of its adherents.</p>
<p>For Mormons grappling with doubts, the potential spiritual consequences can appear frightening&#8230;  At times, the church can appear to respond harshly as well, tales about which surface on <a href="http://www.staylds.com/">stayLDS.com,</a> which receives about 700 visitors a day.</p>
<p>“Candlelight25” writes about his painful decision to leave his mission overseas rather than spread Mormon beliefs against homosexuality. When he returned home he says he faced a disciplinary hearing, for saying he didn’t believe church teachings and for having unrepented-for sex with a man. “If any of you have any advice for me or any comments that may help me now, I would appreciate them more than ever,” he writes.</p>
<p>He says he often feels like an outsider at church. On Mother’s Day, with one testimony after another about children and family, his wife and six children are no longer in the pews with him since his wife abandoned the church because she felt oppressed as a Mormon woman.</p>
<p>“I’ve put my whole life into this — I did a mission, I taught Sunday school, my family is Mormon, you’re going to tell me I’m not part of this? Just watch me.”</p>

New Order Mormons are those who no longer believe some (or much) of the dogma or doctrines of the LDS Church, but who want to maintain membership for cultural, social, or even spiritual reasons. New Order Mormons recognize both good and bad in the Church, and have determined that the Church does not have to be perfect in order to remain useful.

				<p><em>Last year, David Wasserstein, the senior scholar of Islam became the holder of distinguished chair as&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/historydept/wasserstein.html">Professor of Jewish Studies in Vanderbilt</a>. His prior positions included Tel Aviv University. I had know his work as one of the best introductions to the world of the Golden Age in Spain, where he explained the world of poets and their patrons. I also knew him from his work&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;why the center of culture moved from Baghdad to Spain,&nbsp;paralleled&nbsp;by the decline of the Geonim and the ascent of Lucena. See,&nbsp;<em>The Rise and Fall of the Party-Kings, Politics and Society in Islamic Spain, 1002-1086</em>&nbsp;(Princeton 1985);&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Caliphate in the West. An Islamic Political Institution in the Iberian Peninsula</em>&nbsp;(Oxford 1993). In his new&nbsp;position, he was invited to give four lectures on Jews and Islam, which look like the first draft of a book. Unlike the older romantic approach that assumed that all was great under Islam as a golden age, Wasserstein now has to deal with the untrained&nbsp;amateur&nbsp;online historians who create a counter myth that&nbsp;everything&nbsp;was bad. Jews did well not&nbsp;because&nbsp;of liberal leadership but when the muslim community had moments of cultural creativity,&nbsp;Jews&nbsp;were inspired&nbsp;to do&nbsp;the same. His bigger new thesis is that the Talmud would have been unknown to Western Jews as long as the Persians and Byzantium were at war. His opening lecture was<a href="http:///www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/68082/so-what-did-muslims-do-jews"> published by the Jewish Chronicle.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Islam saved Jewry.</strong> This is an unpopular, discomforting claim in the modern world. But it is a historical truth. The argument for it is double. First, in 570 CE, when the Prophet Mohammad was born, the Jews and Judaism were on the way to oblivion. And second, the coming of Islam saved them, providing a new context in which they not only survived, but flourished, laying foundations for subsequent Jewish cultural prosperity &#8211; also in Christendom &#8211; through the medieval period into the modern world.</p>
<p>By the fourth century, Christianity had become the dominant religion in the Roman empire. One aspect of this success was opposition to rival faiths, including Judaism, along with massive conversion of members of such faiths, sometimes by force, to Christianity&#8230;Great and permanent reductions in numbers through conversion, between the fourth and the seventh centuries, brought with them a gradual but relentless whittling away of the status, rights, social and economic existence, and religious and cultural life of Jews all over the Roman empire.</p>
<p>Had Islam not come along, Jewry in the west would have declined to disappearance and Jewry in the east would have become just another oriental cult</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;The most important single work of Jewish cultural creativity in over 3,000 years, apart from the Bible itself &#8211; the Talmud &#8211; came into being in Babylon. The struggle between Persia and Byzantium, in our period, led increasingly to a separation between Jews under Byzantine, Christian rule and Jews under Persian rule.</p>
</div>
<p>Jewish life in the Christian world of late antiquity was not simply a pale shadow of what it had been three or four centuries earlier. It was doomed.</p>
<p>Had Islam not come along, the conflict with Persia would have continued. The separation between western Judaism, that of Christendom, and Babylonian Judaism, that of Mesopotamia, would have intensified. Jewry in the west would have declined to disappearance in many areas. And Jewry in the east would have become just another oriental cult.</p>
<p>But this was all prevented by the rise of Islam. The Islamic conquests of the seventh century changed the world, and did so with dramatic, wide-ranging and permanent effect for the Jews.</p>
<p>Almost all the Jews in the world were now ruled by Islam. This new situation transformed Jewish existence. Their fortunes changed in legal, demographic, social, religious, political, geographical, economic, linguistic and cultural terms &#8211; all for the better.</p>
<p>First, things improved politically&#8230;&nbsp;The result of the conquests was, by and large, to make the Jews second-class citizens.This should not be misunderstood: to be a second-class citizen was a far better thing to be than not to be a citizen at all&#8230;&nbsp;for the first few centuries, the Muslims themselves were a minority, and the practical differences were not all that great.</p>
<p>Along with legal near-equality came social and economic equality. .. Along with internal legal autonomy, they also enjoyed formal representation, through leaders of their own, before the authorities of the state. Imperfect and often not quite as rosy as this might sound, it was at least the broad norm.</p>
<p>Huge numbers of people in the new world of Islam adopted the language of the Muslim Arabs&#8230;The Jews moved over to Arabic very rapidly. By the early 10th century, only 300 years after the conquests, Sa&#8217;adya Gaon was translating the Bible into Arabic. Bible translation is a massive task &#8211; it is not undertaken unless there is a need for it. By about the year 900, the Jews had largely abandoned other languages and taken on Arabic.</p>
<p>The change of language in its turn brought the Jews into direct contact with broader cultural developments. The result from the 10th century on was a striking pairing of two cultures. The Jews of the Islamic world developed an entirely new culture, which differed from their culture before Islam in terms of language, cultural forms, influences, and uses. Instead of being concerned primarily with religion, the new Jewish culture of the Islamic world, like that of its neighbours, mixed the religious and the secular to a high degree. The contrast, both with the past and with medieval Christian Europe, was enormous.</p>
<p>The subjects that Jews wrote about, and the literary forms in which they wrote about them, were largely new ones, borrowed from the Muslims and developed in tandem with developments in Arabic Islam.</p>
<p>Much of the greatest poetry in Hebrew written since the Bible comes from this period. Sa&#8217;adya Gaon, Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Ibn Ezra (Moses and Abraham), Maimonides, Yehuda Halevi, Yehudah al-Harizi, Samuel ha-Nagid, and many more &#8211; all of these names, well known today, belong in the first rank of Jewish literary and cultural endeavour.</p>
<p>W here did these Jews produce all this? When did they and their neighbours achieve this symbiosis, this mode of living together? The Jews did it in a number of centres of excellence. The most outstanding of these was Islamic Spain, where there was a true Jewish Golden Age, alongside a wave of cultural achievement among the Muslim population. The Spanish case illustrates a more general pattern, too.</p>
<p>What happened in Islamic Spain &#8211; waves of Jewish cultural prosperity paralleling waves of cultural prosperity among the Muslims &#8211; exemplifies a larger pattern in Arab Islam. In Baghdad, between the ninth and the twelfth centuries; in Qayrawan (in north Africa), between the ninth and the 11th centuries; in Cairo, between the 10th and the 12th centuries, and elsewhere, the rise and fall of cultural centres of Islam tended to be reflected in the rise and fall of Jewish cultural activity in the same places.</p>
<p>This was not coincidence, and nor was it the product of particularly enlightened liberal patronage by Muslim rulers. It was the product of a number of deeper features of these societies, social and cultural, legal and economic, linguistic and political, which together enabled and indeed encouraged the Jews of the Islamic world to create a novel sub-culture within the high civilisation of the time.</p>
<p>This did not last for ever; the period of culturally successful symbiosis between Jew and Arab Muslim in the middle ages came to a close by about 1300. In reality, it had reached this point even earlier, with the overall relative decline in the importance and vitality of Arabic culture, both in relation to western European cultures..</p>
<p>In the case of the Jews, however, the cultural capital thus created also served as the seed-bed of further growth elsewhere &#8211; in Christian Spain and in the Christian world more generally.</p>
