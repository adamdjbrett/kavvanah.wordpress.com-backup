				<p>Back in 1999, Beinart framed the rise of day schools as a rejection of the original acceptance of public school. The growth of Jewish Day Schools is an abandonment of the American public square.</p>
<p>Beinart pointed out that the rise of day school had other factors than the obvious religious commitment.  Even though day schools were originally for ideologically driven Orthodox who have not totally integrated into America, Day Schools became a form of private school for those moving up the latter. </p>
<p>Now, it seems the drive for day schools is the ideological need to create an enclave, in many classes an upper middle class Orthodox enclave.  In this type of school, what counts? the education or the creation of the enclave?  Some families are clearly still interested in creating private schools better than the public schools while others no longer ask if the day school if better than the public school in social studies, English, arts, or college preparation.  Beinart reminds us to account for the role of the school in social mobility,class and caste. At the end of the twentieth century, day schools were “in” but the word “day school” may have had three different meanings- <strong>a prep school for Jews, a community school for identity, and a day school to create an enclave. </strong><a href="../../2009/09/11/peripheral-vision/index.html"> Studies done by Avi Chai</a> do not differentiate types of schools or factor in class and caste. (<a href="http://www.peje.org/docs/GrowthToronto.pdf">One of the decent studies available on the web</a>, which was done privately by Alex Pomson, shows that in Toronto day schools are not growing relative to population increase.)</p>
<p>Jews supported public school because it helped enforce the separation of Church and State.  Jews did   encourage Christian kids to go to pre-Vatican II Catholic and Protestant schools because it would not have helped their integration. In those days, thinking of America as a Christian country would have meant Jews are excluded. Now, Jews do not worry about the possibility if there are Christian schools that do not offer an American secular narrative  Jews do not worry about being outsiders. Nor do American Orthodox Jews currently worry about the possibility of Afrocentric, Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh private schools.</p>
<p>What  do day school parents feel about the melting pot? I would suspect that many are oblivious or against. Or it is only useful for everyone else. Do some of the parents see that if you exclude yourself from the socialization of the rest of the country then you start to look sectarian? Or if you accept the melting pot for viewing sports and listening to Lady Gaga, but not for social science thinking and historical narrative  then you create a hybridization that may not work in all contexts.  (In the full article, Beinhart cheers for the creation of the New-Jew HS in Boston as outside the box.)</p>
<p><a href="http://http/www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/99oct/9910jewishschools.htm">Read full version of Beinart on Jewish schools here.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Preparing children for &#8220;the general American environment&#8221; meant public education as both practice and ideology. &#8220;The public school,&#8221; says Alvin I. Schiff, the Irving I. Stone Distinguished Professor of Education at Yeshiva University, in New York, &#8220;was considered sacred, holy. It was the method and setting by which Jews could become Americans.&#8221;<br />
All the talk about Jewish identity may also obscure a less high-minded reason for the Jewish-school boom: as Jews have moved up the economic ladder, their commitment to public education has waned.<br />
&#8220;As the public schools have eroded,&#8221; Miller says, &#8220;we are no longer being compared so much to public schools as to other independents.&#8221; Jewish leaders argue that because Jews make up such a small proportion of the U.S. population, the growth of Jewish schools has no real impact on the overall health of American public education. But public schools rely more heavily on Jewish support than the numbers would suggest, in part because Jewish organizations, fearful of any breakdown of the wall between Church and State, have traditionally lobbied hard against school vouchers and other government aid to private schools. As awareness grows that voucher programs might benefit financially strapped Jewish schools, that opposition may diminish.<br />
Yet such parents, by choosing Jewish schools, are preparing their children to lead more observant, less assimilated lives than they do. Some even describe the phenomenon as an inversion of a practice in nineteenth-century Europe whereby parents would remain Jewish but baptize their children.<br />
Why a growing number of relatively secular Jewish parents are abandoning the education model of their youth is a topic of considerable debate within the organized Jewish world</p>
<p>THERE is another, even more sensitive issue lurking behind the Jewish-school phenomenon. Earlier generations of Jews, according to Eduardo Rauch, of the Jewish Theological Seminary, in New York, sent their children to public school not simply as a means of ascending into the middle class but as a show of national loyalty. Today, in contrast, parents are willing to consider Jewish schools in part because they no longer fear being viewed as outsiders. They take their integration into mainstream America as a given. But what if earlier generations were correct &#8212; that full equality in an overwhelmingly Christian country is, in fact, reliant on Jewish willingness to participate in a common system of education?<br />
In fact, when discussing issues like Afrocentrism and bilingual education, American Jewish leaders sometimes bemoan the demise of the melting-pot ideal in this country. Yet separate religious schools both rely on that demise and exacerbate it. The Orthodox community, for its part, has rarely celebrated the melting pot, and generally worries less about total acceptance by the broader culture. </p></blockquote>

				<p>By now everyone has read, reacted, or over reacted to the essay by Peter Beinart, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/">The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment.</a> For a summary and links to many reactions, see <a href="http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2010/05/24/2739289/responding-to-beinart">JTA</a>  or<a href="http://alisonramer.com/2010/05/22/response-to-peter-beinart-your-uncomfortable-zionist-is-here/"> Alison Ramer</a> and <a href="http://menachemmendel.net/blog/2010/05/17/peter-beinart-american-jews-and-saving-israel/">Menachem Mendel.</a> I also assume everyone has read the interesting three part interview with <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/goldblog-vs-peter-beinart-part-i/56914/">Jeffrey Goldberg at the Atlantic</a>. </p>
<p>My interest remains focused only on religion and how it plays itself out in people&#8217;s lives. I will leave to other people and other blogs to deal with the politics. However, in the s<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/goldblog-vs-peter-beinart-part-ii/56934/">econd installment of the interview with Goldberg,</a> I found the following snippet dealing with religion. </p>
<blockquote><p>Jeffrey Goldberg: It&#8217;s interesting to me that you, an Orthodox Jew, don&#8217;t answer the question about Zionism in any sort of theological way whatsoever. </p>
<p>Peter Beinart: I didn&#8217;t call myself an Orthodox Jew; I said I attend an Orthodox synagogue. But anyway, it&#8217;s a reasonable question. I feel a spiritual connection through Jewish observance&#8211;when I&#8217;m in shul, on Shabbat, even through kashrut. And I feel a spiritual connection to Jewish people&#8211;a certain delight at certain Jewish idiosyncracies, at a sense of global peoplehood.</p></blockquote>
<p>My immediate question is what does this say about those gen x&#8217;ers who floated into Orthodoxy during the great revival of the last decades. How do they combine the warm of Shabbat with their liberalism, theological openness, and not fitting into the rigid Orthodox categories. Would the post-orthodox vortex of those demanding rigid definitions of belief and practice throw him out of their sectarian imaginary? Does he fell uncomfortable around Orthodox political views? So I emailed Peter and received the following response. </p>
<blockquote><p>Although there are a lot of Orthodox Jews in my family (my mother is Sephardi, which doesn&#8217;t always translate easily into American categories), I was raised in a Conservative synagogue. I began going to Orthodox synagogues in my 20s.</p>
<p>What appealed to me was the dedication to Jewish learning, which I have come to believe is the only path to Jewish continuity. I feel in many ways limited by the fact that I did not attend Jewish school, and want my children to learn more, far more, than I did at their age. In a way, I&#8217;m more concerned with their knowledge than their observance, though I suspect and hope that the latter will follow the former. (In any case, we&#8217;re less strictly observant than some). If they can feel confident in a Jewish religious context, it will always be available to them, even if they drift away for periods of their lives. I&#8217;m also attracted to Modern Orthodoxy&#8217;s vision of a life in which one can be faithful to halacha (though I myself could be more faithful) and also truly at ease in the world, recognizing the truth and beauty in  non-Jewish things. </p>
<p>In addition, I have always felt a sense of community that I consider precious: the involvement that people have in each other&#8217;s lives, the long, lazy stretches of time during a shabbat meal or at the park on Saturday afternoon, a series of friendships that are not based on work (which I find is very common in Washington), the amount of time we spend in each other&#8217;s homes, the way we watch each other&#8217;s kids grow up.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve also been lucky because my community is very tolerant both in terms of observance and political opinion, even on Israel. (I didn&#8217;t realize quote how tolerant until I wrote my essay).<br />
That makes it much easier for me to deal with those parts of Orthodoxy that do trouble me: for instance, the participation of women. I might have grativated to some more egalitarian conservadox minyan, but the fact that there are so many successful, empowered, articulate women in my community makes me feel more comfortable on questions of gender. There is also a sense of irony and good humor about Orthodox Jewry&#8217;s foibles among our friends that I greatly value.</p>
<p>So I suppose I compromise my liberalism to participate in an Orthodox community, but I&#8217;m willing to do so because I am so enriched by it in so many ways. (And perhaps because I fear that a more universalistic Jewish community would be less of a true Jewish community). So it&#8217;s a little like Zionism. I recognize that to be a Zionist I have to compromise my liberalism: I have to support a Jewish state, which by definition will never be able to provide absolute equality to its non-Jewish citizens. But I try to do so while still hoping for as much liberalism as possible. I&#8217;ve never felt my community is demeaning or disrespectful to women or gays or lesbians or non-Jews, even as I do remain bothered by the roles according to all those groups in mainstream Orthodox practice. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been inspired by various people who are far more learned than me who are also highly critical of certain illiberal, even racist, tendencies that they see in the Orthodox community, and in Israel. They have modeled for me a life of Jewish commitment that is not morally complacent, and which is zealous about the rights and dignity of non-Jews, both in the US and the Middle East. </p>
<p>On the essay itself, I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised&#8211;even moved&#8211;by the reaction from the Jewish Week and from Nathan Diament, who runs the Washington office of the OU. I don&#8217;t expect that publication or organization to agree with my views on Israel, but if there is marginally more concern for the declining Zionism of non-Orthodox Jews, and for the kind of attitudes expressed at the 2002 Israel rally, where a largely Orthodox crowd booed a call to recognize Palestinian suffering, then I will be gratified.</p></blockquote>
<p>We seem to have a functional religion adding value and community to life. His religion is not very theological. Regarding problematic ideas and values, we see an important role played by those who are ironic or critical toward towards their Orthodoxy as helping to make Orthodoxy more welcoming. It seems these friends help lower any religious tensions or cognitive dissidence. I was pleased to see the tolerance and acceptance of diversity within the community, or at least among his friends and acquaintances.<br />
If you comment, limit it to religion. Post the politics on one of the other blogs. </p>

				<p>I have heard from both rabbis and doctors about the different approaches in America and Israel on the view of the fetus and the role of therapeutic abortion. But the contrasts were always framed as US versus Israel or different schools of halakhah neither of which provided a useful focal point to articulate the differences, since America is diverse and halakhhah is ideal-not reality.</p>
<p>Here is a book on Israel compared to Japan that offers much to think about. What is the role of the medical model in the construction of modern Judaism? How is Israeli medical ethics very different than American medical ethics? Is it practice or ideal? (From what I hear, American MO are aggressive in feeding tubes in a way that Israelis are not.) How Jewish views of birth and death may at this point be less in harmony with nature than other cultures. How do views of secular Israel and religious America effect Orthodox practice. How did Centrism halakhah and ideology has adapt the views of the evangelical era? How and why do the actual ethics in the community not follow the rabbis- Modern Orthodox Jews do not usually take pride in and raise severe birth defect children, but American Catholics do. [And American MO HS girls do indeed get pregnant out of wedlock but we dont see corresponding numbers of unwed mothers- practice is not matching theory.] Or I am told by OBGYNs that Hungarian Hasidim in the US take an Israeli approach and rebbitzens can and do decide on ad-hoc terminations of fetuses. I know this introductory paragraph is over-generalized and needs breakdown by demographics and era. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, read this review and ask: what it imply about Israel or Judaism?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2010/mayjun/meaningoflife.html">The Meaning of (Gestating) Life -Pregnancy in Israel and Japan.</a></strong><br />
Elrena Evans | posted 4/23/2010</p>
<p><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s the book about?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s about pregnancy,&#8221; I&#8217;d say. &#8220;In Japan and Israel.&#8221;<br />
This impression in turn led to a developing interest in the lived experience of pregnancy and how it is socially and culturally constructed in different societies.</p>
<p>Although both Israeli and Japanese women experience pregnancy as a highly medicalized event, much as in the United States, the forms that medicalization take differ greatly. And these differences, Ivry argues, are deeply rooted in distinctive cultural contexts: in Israel, a struggle to stay alive amidst constant military conflict; in Japan, an emphasis on the betterment of society through the long-term maternal efforts of child-raising.</p>
<p>If we think of each culture&#8217;s implicit understanding of pregnancy as a narrative, Ivry contends, we&#8217;ll find that the &#8220;protagonist&#8221; of the Japanese narrative differs sharply from the protagonist of the Israeli narrative:</p>
<p><strong>In the Japanese arena the protagonist of pregnancy is the interconnected entity of the mother-baby, whereas in the Israeli case the protagonists are the pregnant woman and her suspect fetus. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy is conceptualized as an early stage of parenting </strong>in Japan and is all about the interdependence of mother and baby and their ongoing relationships. <strong>The Israeli model defines pregnancy as a state &#8220;in limbo&#8221; </strong>that involves two separate individuals (of whom only one is a person).</p>
<p>Japanese pregnancies are understood through a lens Ivry refers to as &#8220;environmentalism,&#8221; by which she means the notion that the mother&#8217;s body (and thus her actions, both physical and mental) are responsible for the outcome of the pregnancy—in other words, the baby. To this end, Japanese ob/gyns place strict boundaries on the body of the pregnant woman: she must not gain too much weight, nor allow herself to become chilled, nor submit herself to the bumps and jerks of public transportation.</p>
<p>This assumption that a woman seeking prenatal care intends to keep her pregnancy does not hold true for the Israeli experience. <strong>Israeli pregnancies, Ivry argues, are understood through the lens of &#8220;geneticism,&#8221;</strong> whereby the random assemblage of genetic material is the dominant factor in determining pregnancy outcome. The role of the Israeli mother is to try and determine the fetus&#8217;s genetic makeup through a battery of prenatal diagnostic tests, and then to act according to the information she receives. <strong>Prenatal diagnosis is both widespread and aggressive, and in the event of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; diagnosis, abortion is expected.</strong></p>
<p>Ivry categorizes pregnancy for Israeli women as a &#8220;risky business.&#8221; <strong>Unlike the mother-baby dyad of Japanese pregnancies, Israeli pregnancies are strictly woman (not mother) and fetus</strong>. &#8220;When a woman walks into my office and says &#8216;I&#8217;m pregnant,'&#8221; Ivry quotes an Israeli ultrasound expert as saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t touch her. I don&#8217;t say anything to her, I open a new card, and I write that I recommend an abortion. Then I sign her up on a paper that says that she is aware of all the testing that exists. Now we can begin to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>When pregnant Israeli women contemplate amniocentesis, a diagnostic test that can identify chromosomal abnormalities but carries with it the risk of miscarriage, Israeli ob/gyns routinely frame the decision thus, Ivry tells us: women must weigh the grief of losing a healthy child against the grief of bearing a child with a disability. Nowhere is the grief over losing a disabled child so much as even mentioned; it is taken for granted that a disabled child is unwanted. As for the disabled community in Israel, Ivry notes that <strong>&#8220;Israelis with disabilities are often quoted in the media as supporting the diagnostic endeavor to prevent the birth of other people who would suffer the kind of life that they endure.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Update &#8211;  Serious and Thoughtful Comment by AS </strong></p>
<p>First, I tend to bristle at the term therapeutic abortion when applied to cases where the only risk involved is having a child with a disability. We generally refer to this as selective abortion because it fits in the general category of abortion based on the projected traits of the child. The term is either a deliberate euphemism or a projection of the mistaken idea that anything done in a medical context on the basis of medical information is therapeutic.</p>
<p>In any event, to understand the relevance to Orthodoxy in Israel and America this study should probably be put into the context of three other books:<br />
1) The Tentative Pregnancy by Barbara Katz Rothman<br />
2) Testing Women, Testing the Fetus by Rayna Rapp<br />
3) Reproducing Jews by Susan Martha Kahn<br />
The first two describe how prenatal testing has changed pregnancy in America, the last how technically mediated reproduction in Israel reflects a preoccupation with the need to increase the population of Jews and a reflection of how the fraught “who is a Jew” question gets translated into medical culture. I believe that what the abortion data from israel show is that there is not just a concern with producing Jews, but producing healthy able bodied Jews, and this likely reflects some of the ideals of the halutzim and the like.</p>
<p>Talking with Israeli midwives and doctors as well as other anecdotal evidence (and somewhat confirmed here at the blog <a href="http://www.amotherinisrael.com/abortion-in-the-religious-zionist-community">a mother in israel</a> is that in the religious Zionist community selective abortion for disability occurs at a pretty high rate. It is also likely that Both R. Waldenberg’s and R. Aviner’s positions contribute to this phenomena.</p>
<p>When we come to American Orthodox communities I can offer the following observations/theories:<br />
The uptake of preconception genetic testing is quite high. and the overall medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth is high as well<br />
While ACOGS pushes for prenatal testing to be offered as a matter of course for younger and younger women, their is widespread recognition among doctors that there are many people who will not abort fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities on principle and therefore refusal of amnio is not completely out of the ordinary. Refusal of ultrasound is unusual.</p>
<p>Medical ethics in America is an established discipline with widely accepted ideas of patient autonomy and “non-directedness” on the part of genetic counselors. Medical ethics in Israel as a distinct discipline is pretty inchoate.</p>
<p>The disability rights critique of routinized testing and selective abortion is unknown to most orthodox Jews, and this reflects the fact that to my knowledge, adult orthodox Jews with disabilities may be reluctant to bring disability rights identity politics into the dialogues they have within their religious communities (the orthodox deaf community is not surprisingly a bit of an exception to this rule)</p>
<p>As far as raising children with disabilities: Modern Orthodox Jews like their larger socioeconomic cohort, have fewer children and tend to share concerns that a disabled child will disrupt their family in various ways and create a situation that is unfair to their other children and that impinges on their lifestyle. American Hareidim have more children but their concern is that a disabled child – especially if it is a genetic trait – will harm their other children’s ability to marry well.<br />
As this is an area that I study I could say more, but don’t have too much time.</p>
<p>One thing I read recently that was interesting and perhaps relevant is Shalom Carmy’s review in the inaugural Jewish Review of Books.  I recall the article ending with a claim that while Orthodox Halakha tends to ignore larger ethical motifs (like human dignity/created in God’s image) the way that Christians do, becuase its casuistic approach is more sensitive to the needs of people in particular situations. I take issue to this claim given the actual data on abortion. In short, without a larger conversation about how society views the disabled and how the medical model of disability tends to point toward the elimination of disability by eliminating people with disabilities, one fails to see how the supposed case-by case analysis of Halakhah that ignores larger social questions ends up simply reflecting whatever values tend to dominate. This is especially true when those values become invisible components of what is passed as objective medical information.</p>

				<p>Another random nugget-<a href="http://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2010/05/the-rise-of-sarcasm.html"> this time from here. </a><br />
I have always wondered about the compatibility of religiosity and sarcasm or about guys who increase their sarcasm as they buy into a yeshivish life.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Phil Vischer, the creator of VeggieTales, gave a speech at Yale in 2005 in which he unpacked the media values of our generation &#8212; the slow descent from our parents&#8217; ‘dry, cocktail party wit of Johnny Carson’ to the ‘sarcasm and twisted humor’ of David Letterman, and the emergence of the bottom-feeder humor that is Beavis and Butt-head and South Park. In these shows, Vischer says, ‘we had found our voice. We were safe from the world, as long as everything was treated as a joke.’He continues: Some folks believe Vietnam was the source of America&#8217;s modern cynicism. Others point to Watergate. But for me and for many others in my generation, the real root, I think, is much closer to home and much more personal. When we were very young, our parents broke their promises. Their promises to each other, and their promises to us. And millions of American kids in a very short period of time learned that the world isn&#8217;t a safe place; that there isn&#8217;t anyone who won&#8217;t let you down; that their hearts were much too fragile to leave exposed. And sarcasm, as CS Lewis put it, ‘builds up around a man the finest armor-plating &#8230; that I know.’”<br />
 Sarcasm seems to me to be a mixed bag. It is an effective rhetorical tool in criticizing customs, habits, institutions, and authorities. It is funny. But it does create an emotional distance – a dehumanizing “armor-plating.” As Jethani argues, it distances us from our anger and our fear. As I read him, he believes we cannot break through to love without directly confronting our anger and our fear. </em></p>

				<p>An interesting tidbit from the web tonight. Any thoughts?</p>
<p><em><a href="http://missivesfrommarx.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/why-i-hate-the-science-and-religion-discourse/">Why I Hate the Science and Religion Discourse</a><br />
May 22, 2010<br />
by missivesfrommarx</p>
<p>      * “Science” is not just one thing, and neither is “religion” a monolith. Not all science vs. religion discourses imply this, but most of them do. Those things grouped under the terms “scientific” and “religious” are incredibly diverse and sometimes even overlap.<br />
     * The agenda of this discourse is largely set&#8230; by the European enlightenment. The concerns of the science vs. religion discourse are not universal, either in time or space, although the discourse pretends as if they are—as if “science” and “religion” have been battling forever and will continue to battle for eternity&#8230; most of the people in human history would find this discourse to be irrelevant to them and their lives.<br />
    * The discourse often amounts to either Christian  [or Jewish] apologetics or responses to Christian [or Jewish ] apologetics. (This seems to me to make the science vs. religion debate fundamentally unscholarly, since I take it for granted that religious studies scholars are not supposed to have their research agendas straightforwardly set by the people they study.)<br />
    * The discourse often treats “religion” as a series of true or false propositions, much like the new atheists do. Focusing on the truth or falsehood of an ideology fundamentally misses the social work accomplished by that ideology. The proper response to Mein Kampf is not (primarily) to point out logical contradictions, but to point to the social effects of its racist ideology. In my opinion, the best response to creationism is not to attempt a demonstration of its falsehood, but to show what sort of ideological function it might serve for those communities that support it.</em></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Time for the final chapter.  Continued from <a href="../../2010/05/01/arthur-green-%E2%80%93-radical-judaism-3/index.html">here</a> and <a href="../../2010/05/08/green-radical-judaism-4/index.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Green asks: What Does God want you to do? or as Green puts it Who are you?  What does it mean to be human?</p>
<p>For Green, the answer must come from our sense of Creation that includes all of humanity, we need to internalize a universalist concept that man is the image of God.  (We don’t get an ethicist&#8217;s or jurist&#8217;s list of ethical principles.) There is an evolutionary human development toward greater universalism. So rather than giving us a theory of justice, we get a discussion of how can we still use the kabbalistic language of soul as a basis for universalism. Green strength is his personal honesty to state that he is hesitant to use the word metaphysical word soul but then turns it around to preserve the holy language of the soul by stating that the soul is the recognition that we are a holy being enjoined to remember to respect and rejoin the pantheistic source of all being. Immortality is the acknowledgment of the circle of life. There are new babies and new flowers and eternal renewal. (What I get is a sensibility more than universal values.)</p>
<p>Green places the current debate among Israeli Religious Zionists about universalism in a footnote but does not enter the fray. What did Hazal do with the universal principles of image of God and Love thy neighbor? Alon Goshen-Gottstein sees these ideas as too universal for Hazal while Yair Lorberbaum shows how Maimonides and Nahmanides retained aspects of these ideas to create metaphysics. [As a contrast to Green, when Rav Cherlow asks this question of what God wants from you– he responds with a compassionate Jewish law of values.] </p>
<p>Green states that he is not worried over who is a Jew, and other discredited nineteenth century ideas like race and peoplehood. He feels that there is too much emphasis in Jewish life on the insecurity of our existence and not enough on our status as seekers. Choosing of Israel does not mean rejection of other people. The Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War created a lasting impression on Jews. But Israel and the law of return is still bound to the Nuremburg laws.  Jews are seekers, not a race.  (echoes of  Avraham Burg, but the later advocates ethics.) For Green, between the universal seeker and tribal Jew is the Jewish seeker.  </p>
<p>Green does not consider the way the Jewish seeker plays itself out in real life. Two common forms of the Jewish seeker are (1) the tribal seeker, who has a universal Judaism and hates other faiths or commitments. he Bu-Jew with a hatred of Christianity and Islam. (2)Or those so tribal that they say anything she touches is Jewish. This second Jewish seeker is adamant that any fragment of Buddhism or Yoga that they like is a fulfillment of Judaism </p>
<p>Green describes himself as a religious Jew and secular Zionist. There is no religious or messianic status to the land of Israel. But essentially he remains a diasporist.</p>
<p>Green has a nice section on his differences from Heschel. For Heschel, one actually gives to God when performing a mizvah- there is real theurgy. Heschel had a Biblical personalist image of with mystical overtones, and Green admits that he is a pantheist with personalist overtones A pantheistic God as energy that offers blessing – meaning an energy that adds value and meaning to the world. Heschel was God’s partner- he translated prophetic and kabbalistic language into  personalist language.Heschel has traditional views of God, Torah, Israel.  Heschel  approach to the law was apologetic combined with a plea for more compassion and decency. Green approach is heterodoxy. Green acknowledges that Heschel  has both a progressive approach, which Green likes, but also a strong conservative trend. </p>
<p>Well was this book a vision for the 21st century future of Judaism or was it just the spiritual autobiography of a baby-boomer?</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="../../2010/05/20/meditation-conference/index.html" title="10:50 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">May 20, 2010</span></a> <span class="by-author"><span class="sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="../../author/kavvanah/index.html" title="View all posts by Alan Brill" rel="author">Alan Brill</a></span> </span><span class="comments-link"><span class="meta-sep">|</span> <a href="../../2010/05/20/meditation-conference/index.html#respond">Leave a comment</a></span>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The organizers of the meditation conference assumed meditation was a means of sitting and saying a verbal focus which would lead to calm, well-being, and better health. They wanted to find out how this truth of meditation plays itself out in the religions and cultures of the world. Instead, they found themselves with over fifty experts on meditation techniques in Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism saying that this definition of meditation is not found in the traditional texts or traditional meditation communities.  There was a feeling that Western people, in America and Europe, have an idea of meditation and speak of meditation as a know entity that was unknown to the academics in the field. </p>
<p>We felt that we could have used a panel session on where this idea of mediation came from and how in the last 35 years in has become part of Western religion and spirituality. In short, we pieced together that the theosophists and translators of the sacred books of the east created a version of mediation as psychology. In the 1970’s when TM and Zen became popular as well as reading the older works, then we get a flurry of books on “what is meditation.” By the 1980’s we can speak of the “meditation of poetry”, the “meditation of surfing”  the “meditation of yoga” or the “meditation of Chabad fabrengen”  A rightful possession of American spirituality that Americans  wont let experts take away from them. Herbert Benson created the relaxation response and formulated meditation as a form of calm and healthy wellbeing. But this definition is not a traditional one. This was further removed from any tradition by psycho neurology that used its own definitions not accepted by any known religion- except contemporary spirituality. Even frum jews love to use the word when it does not correspond to anything in traditional texts.</p>
<p>So the conference ran as follows:</p>
<p>The calmness of meditation is claimed to be based on the Indic concept of Samadhi, but Samadhi is not calmness, rather a secession of emotions, desires, thoughts, and brain functions so one can transcend the world. Indian and Buddhism meditation is not about calmness and wellness- it is about pain and suffering and rubbing your nose in the inevitability of suffering. Zen is not very calm and includes sweat inducing koans, being hit by the Roshi, unquestioning tasks,  and pain.  Jewish texts on hitbddedut and kavvanah are about coming closer to God sometimes via ecstasy and emotional upheaval.</p>
<p>The modern definition takes out the purpose of meditation in India or China which is to either escape the world or seek enlightenment. And it has little to do with the Jewish and Islamic themes of God in the heart, or the Tibetan and Daoist alchemical techniques for longevity.  After the presentation on vipassana, any vestiges of the opening premises were gone.  Vipassana was originally the national ideal of Burma for a educated well cultivated approached to stoically wait for the British colonialists to leave.  It was then modernized in the Vietnam War, but still little to do with the current practice of that name. There was little respect for the Dalai Lama at the conference with his promising this-worldly happiness and well being for those who meditate, when his own Tibetan traditions do not teach that. </p>
<p>There was a general consensus that most current practices performed in the west were recent. They were either from the term of the 20th century and involved modernization and Westernization. We find Buddhists reading William James and rediscovering new techniques in manuscript.  Then there are new versions of the 1960’s. Finally, there was consensus that anyone claiming tradition and authority in the US teaching “meditation” in the modern sense was either a charlatan or a student of one.  Trust those who either acknowledge they are doing something modern or those who don’t promise calm and well being. Everyone saw a decrease in interest in traditional forms of meditation since the 1990&#8217;s becuase everyone now knows that they want this new Western meditation &#8211; but they want it with a Yoga, Hasidic, or QiGong veneer.</p>
<p>From a Jewish point of view, this means that Ramak, Ari”zl, Chabad, and Rav Nahman all have versions of hitbodedut, hitbonenut, kavvanah, and yihud but there is nothing gained conceptually or linguistically by calling them meditation and they have little to do with any clinical calming technique.  (it might have briefly made sense in the 1970’s when stolid religion was breaking down and the BT world was aiming in this realm.)  The reliance of the Piesetzna and Menachem Eckstein on modern psychology is par for the course-as is Aryeh Kaplan’s reading of the Dover Publishing Co. books from the early 20th century on Tibetan and Chinese meditation.  And sitting for mindfulness before davening is not Buddhist, not Jewish, not Indian but it is American new age spiritual. Sitting before davening has little to do with the Ramak or Ari”zl. </p>
<p>By the end we concluded that there is use for term like visualization, body techniques, or mental apophasis.<br />
One can speak of a Jewish kavvanah of the Ramak as a form of visualization. But it does not share the formal aspects of sitting of the Zen tradition and it lacks the ending of mental  facilities like Samadhi and it lack to goal to escape the world of most Buddhist practices.  It does not have the mental requirements of Jnana. Yet, there is more to the analogy than just visions since it does take one to a place above the “pain of this world”  creating some very weak similarity to Jnana and Samadhi. But the goal of daat and berakhah are very unYogic. One can also find close similarities to Sufis and certain out of context Daoist similarities.</p>
<p>Now what? We shall see if they get funding for follow-up conferences.</p>
