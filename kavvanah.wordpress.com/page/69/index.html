				<p>I still have a few more posts on popular culture before I am done with the topic. This tic wont last longer than this month. We will return to Green-Landes debate when I receive the next batch of materials.</p>
<p>In the context of the new book about the relgion of Oprah, there is an older book that keeps figuring int he discussions. <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/excerpt.php?isbn=9780520242807#readtheintroduction">Authentic Fakes<br />
Religion and American Popular Culture</a> by David Chidester</p>
<p>Chidester points out how popular culture lowers the seriousness of the discussion of relgion to tolerable levels. (Some of you remember the RJJ article by Levitt from a few years ago that suggests that the reason for so much talk in shul is to reduce the tension that they dont believe in/appreciate prayer.)<br />
Chidester also notes how much popular culture is based on the body- think of the year in Israel as part of a construction of the body –it is about changes in dress, taste, touch, and movement. How does it serve the pop culture needs of the American students.<br />
One of the important point made by Chidester is the quest for authenticity and how brand new produced objects can take on an aura of authenticity. Certainly, everything done in a gap-year in Israel takes on an air of authenticity. One can teach any new age practice, any metaphysical thinking or tell any homily and by virtue of the situation it becomes authentic.<br />
Even here in the US, what makes the purim videos – authentic? What makes orthodox popular culture as orthodoxy?<br />
And finally, the economic comodification side- what objects are fetishized in Orthoodxy, what serves as a magic object of possession? </p>
<p><em>Religion is serious. According to the great psychologist of religion William James, religion &#8220;signifies always a serious state of mind.&#8221; Popular culture, by contrast, is not serious. Or is it? In this book, I posit that it certainly is. Through the idea of religion, I will engage the compelling political, social, and economic realities of America, at home and abroad, as expressed in American popular culture.</p>
<p>From the most intimate embodiment of personal subjectivity to the most public institutions of social collectivity, what I call religion is at work and at play. It is at work in the disciplines of the body, the regulation of one&#8217;s conduct, and the legitimization of political, social, or economic power. It is at play in the creative improvisations, innovations, transformations, and transgressions of all that serious religious work. Of course, sometimes work can seem like play, so this initial opposition between religious work and religious play will blur.<br />
What difference does it make to call any cultural activity &#8220;religion&#8221;? As we will see, religion can be useful term for understanding the ways in which transcendence, the sacred, and the ultimate are inevitably drawn into doing some very important things that happen in and through popular culture: forming a human community, focusing human desire, and entering into human relations of exchange.</p>
<p>Social cohesion, in forming a sense of community, is reinforced by religious resources. Rising above the everyday course of life, traces of transcendence seem necessary for instilling a sense of continuity with the past. Set apart from the ordinary world, traces of the sacred seem necessary for establishing a sense of uniformity in the present. In the play of popular culture, religious techniques for creating sacred time and sacred space have generated a sense of community within a diverse array of cultural enterprises, such as the church of baseball, the pilgrimage to Graceland, the devotion to Star Trek, and the proliferation of invented religions on the Internet. </p>
<p>Although the notion of the fetish calls attention to an important religious activity—the formation and focusing of human desire</p>
<p>To adopt a phrase coined by the unconventional sociologist Georges Bataille, popular culture celebrates ritualized expenditure in nonproductive economic activity. Not for profit, as Bataille argued, expenditure is economic activity in which the loss must be as great as possible in order to certify a claim on ultimate meaning. Ritual expenditure occurs in a gift, a display, or a performance of wealth. But expenditure also takes place in the waste, the destruction, or the irrecoverable loss of valued objects, including the highly valued &#8220;object&#8221; of human life. In many contexts, such as the performance of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll or the mystery of the global economy, we will see ritual expenditure, in Bataille&#8217;s sense, operating within religion and American popular culture.</p>
<p>the gospel of money by television ministries, which appeal to their viewers for support funding, promising miraculous financial returns to the donors; and even the religious devotion to money in the online Church of the Profit$, which claims to be the only honest, authentic religion in America because it openly admits that it is only in it for the money.<br />
These, then, are three reasons for investigating religion in American popular culture: religious activity is at work in forming community, focusing desire, and facilitating exchange.<br />
Religion and Popular Culture in Embodied, National, and Global Spheres<br />
As a religion of the body, the religion of American popular culture involves the most basic, visceral engagements with the world. Sex, drugs, and the pulsating rhythms of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll embrace the body in an immediacy, an intensity, although the mind and soul might subsequently follow. Mediated through the senses, especially through the physical sense of touch, the embodied character of religion in American popular culture appears in the binding, burning, moving, and handling of religious meaning and power, but it also registers as religion under pressure, as a pervasive sense of anxiety, distraction, and stress in a world that seems to be spinning out of control.</p>
<p>Although I take the human body as the basic ground of religion, it also is important to recognize that much of the creativity of popular culture involves changing or leaving the body. Many ways of modifying the body—piercing and tattooing, plastic surgery and liposuction, cross-dressing and transsexual surgery—have increasingly become part of the American way of life. At the same time, Americans have sought to leave their bodies, flying out of this ordinary world into cyberspace, or virtual reality, unencumbered by the physical pull of planetary gravity or the physical weight of human embodiment. In these efforts, echoes of shamanism, the archaic &#8220;techniques of ecstasy,&#8221; reverberate.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, I confront the problem of authenticity. Although the productions of popular culture might in many ways look, sound, smell, taste, and feel like religion, there is a distinct possibility that they are not actually religious. Baseball is not a religion; Coca-Cola is not a religion; and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll is not a religion. But then all kinds of religious activity have been denied the status of religion, including indigenous religions labeled as superstition and alternative religious movements labeled as cults. What counts as religion, therefore, is the focus of the problem of authenticity in religion and American popular culture. Making the problem worse, some religious activity appears transparently fake, including the proliferation of invented religions on the Internet, but even fake religions can be doing a kind of symbolic, cultural, and religious work that is real.</em></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The French Catholic novelist François Mauriac inspired Elie Wiesel’s Night, specifically the image of the hanged boy as the suffering of God. Mauriac also inspired <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silence-Shusaku-Endo/dp/0800871863">Shusaku Endo</a> to produce a book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_%28novel%29">Silence</a>, about the silence of God before the Japanese sea. He was described by Graham Greene as one of the century&#8217;s greatest writers. If I had to speak this weekend about the tragedy in Japan, I would start here. Camus&#8217;s questions meet religious answers. Let me know if you use it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shusaku Endo was one of Japan&#8217;s great 20th century authors, and like Walker Percy and Graham Greene, he is a Catholic who spent a good portion of his literary life writing about his faith and his struggle with it. As a Catholic, Silence is a book that really makes me think. I don&#8217;t know that Endo provides any answers, but he asks a question that I think most Catholics don&#8217;t want to face. </p>
<p>Endo picks an awesome setting for his question: the period of Christian persecution in Japan in the late 1500s and 1600s, when many Japanese Catholics and European priests were tortured and forced to apostatize. Endo&#8217;s &#8220;silence&#8221; is the silence of God in the face of these awful events. After experiencing one of these events, one of Endo&#8217;s characters writes: I cannot bear the monotonous sound of the dark sea gnawing at the shore. Behind the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of God&#8230;..the feeling that while men raise their voices in anguish God remains with folded arms, silent.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while Endo&#8217;s main character, the priest Sebastian Rodrigues, struggles with this question and his faith, I found the book as a whole to be faith-affirming. Like Miguel de Unamuno&#8217;s San Manuel Bueno, Martir (the story of a priest who doesn&#8217;t believe in the resurrection), the loss of faith equates to a loss of purpose, a loss of strength and a loss of humanity which paints the power of God &#8212; silent though He may be &#8212; much more powerfully than words could ever do. While engaged in the struggle, Rodrigues (and his brother priests and Christians) have a strength to which we gravitate. When they lose their struggle, they become (repeatedly Endo uses this word to such powerful effect): &#8220;servile.&#8221; How ironic. When characters place themselves at the service of God, they are pillars of strength. When they reject their faith-driven duty, they become servile</p>
<p>Endo&#8217;s 1966 novel Silence portrays the visit of a Portuguese Jesuit priest to Japan in the 17th century. In one scene, the priest looks out over a ruined village, and prays: &#8220;The village had been burnt to the ground; and its inhabitants had been completely dispersed. The sea and the land were silent as death; only the dull sound of the waves lapping against the boat broke the silence of the night. Why have you abandoned us so completely? he prayed in a weak voice. Even the village was constructed for you; and have you abandoned it in its ashes? &#8230; Have you just remained silent like the darkness that surrounds me? Why? At least tell me why. We are not strong men like Job who was afflicted with leprosy as a trial. There is a limit to our endurance. Give us no more suffering. So he prayed. But the sea remained cold, and the darkness maintained its stubborn silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scottish composer James Macmillan&#8217;s Symphony No. 3, &#8220;Silence&#8221; is based off of Endo&#8217;s novel. It&#8217;s an incredibly powerful piece of music&#8211;a jarring yet hopeful musical exploration of the &#8220;silence of God in the face of terrible events.&#8221; Here is an excerpt from Macmillan&#8217;s program notes: </p>
<p>&#8220;Endo&#8217;s &#8216;silence&#8217; is the silence of God in the face of terrible events springing from the merciless nature of man: torture, genocide, holocaust. After experiencing one of these events, one of Endo&#8217;s characters writes: &#8216;I cannot bear the monotonous sound of the dark sea gnawing at the shore. Behind the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of God… the feeling that while men raise their voices in anguish, God remains with folded arms, silent.&#8217;</p>
<p>For Endo, though, this silence is not absence but presence. It is the silence of accompaniment rather than &#8220;nihil&#8221;. This is a notion that has many musical analogies. Music itself grows out of silence. The emptiness and solitude of a composer&#8217;s silence is nevertheless pregnant with the promise of possibility and potency.</p>

				<p>There are lots of baby-boomer life narratives that have been popping up. I pay attention to the ones that describe spiritual journeys. This is by Frumma Gottlieb, who once published a long, beautiful, and very personal Jungian meditation on Judaism called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lamp-God-Jewish-Book-Light/dp/1568219229">Lamp Of God</a> (Jason Aronson, 1996).  Among other tidbits about her is that she originally produced organic foods in Colorado and she is Aviva Zorenberg&#8217;s  sister. Here she describes the change from her organic crunchy life in Colorado and her transition to Chabad, she also describes her views of meditation. I posted about half of it. Notice how she describes what she sees as the function of meditation as dealing with stress and its role in insights. On the <a href="http:///kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-lubavitcher-rebbe-on-transcendental-meditation/">Rebbe and Meditation, it was one of my early posts.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>On Mindfulness and Jewish Meditation, Part I<br />
By Frumma Rosenberg-Gottlieb</p>
<p>In the early 1970s I left my farm on the western slope of the Colorado Rockies to come to New York and study Torah. It was not easy to leave the crisp autumn mornings, the quaking aspens, the summer meadows filled with wildflowers and the snowcapped mountains. It was harder still to leave my fifty acres of organic fruit trees, the bees buzzing in the apricot blossoms, and my powerfully graceful chestnut quarter-horse, Flash. Most difficult of all was leaving a community where everyone was a meditator, where the vibration in my hundred-year-old log cabin was one of calm awareness and serenity. I kissed the ground, and I cried.</p>
<p>Most difficult of all was leaving a community where everyone was a meditator. When I arrived at my spiritual destination, a religious community in New York, I found that I was not unique. I was one of many truth-seekers who had made this pilgrimage from a world where the cultivation of consciousness had been a core value, yet we had felt something lacking. Some of us had lived on communes in Vermont and Oregon, or on sloops in Costa Rica and Nova Scotia; others had left graduate programs at Harvard, Berkeley, and MIT in search of the secrets of inner peace possessed by the holy men of antiquity. Upon realizing that a pastoral lifestyle and exotic Eastern meditation techniques were simply fast foods for our hungry Jewish souls, we had turned toward the nourishing wisdom of our abandoned birthright. We had chosen a Torah life.</p>
<p>Though the teachings were elevating, the family life was inspiring, and the mitzvahs were an everyday source of meaning and joy, I must confess that I didn’t feel the calm. Where was the tranquility? Is mindfulness, I wondered, an ingredient in a Torah life? I rarely heard my Torah teachers speak of cultivating inner awareness. Over time, however, as I became more sophisticated in my understanding of Torah, I realized that mindfulness and a peaceful, balanced soul is indeed an objective in Jewish life, and that the tools for attaining it are subtly woven into the tapestry of Torah knowledge. I learned, for example, that the Hebrew word “shalom” implies not just peace, but also completion, perfection, wholeness. We bless one another with peace; our daily prayers culminate in a request for peace.</p>
<p>As my Torah knowledge expanded, my curiosity deepened. I eagerly devoured any information that dealt with the intersection of Torah and psychology, focusing especially on how a Torah lifestyle enriches inner experience as well as outer behaviors and relationships. On subtle levels, the introspection and the refinement of values that form the core of a Torah life foster an experience of shalom in both senses of the word—a peaceful spirit, and a sense of wholeness. Chassidic philosophy demonstrates how inner turmoil is reduced when we have a clear understanding of our goals, and how the cultivation of trust, faith, awareness, and freedom from doubt enriches our lives with joy. I began to discover that Jewish tradition deeply addresses topics that many of us first encountered in other ancient cultures, or in practices and perspectives currently referred to as “New Age.”</p>
<p>One of the principal techniques for achieving a peaceful soul is establishing regular times for meditation. While “meditation” suggests an image of someone sitting in cross-legged lotus position with eyes closed and incense burning, meditation in a general sense comprises a wide variety of practices. All of them involve harnessing the dynamics of the mind in order to think in a more intentional, less random or accidental manner. Most also entail a certain quietude of mind, a sense of surrender to a higher or deeper aspect of the mind.</p>
<p>In his pioneering spirit, the Rebbe urged us to develop acceptable meditation methodologies that would serve as tools for overcoming stress and anxiety. In 1977 the Rebbe began a push to make a kosher form of meditation available to the public. The Rebbe specifically mentioned the efficacy of meditation as an antidote to stress and anxiety; he was concerned, however, that many of the more popular teachings were not consistent with Torah values. He reached out personally to a number of religious psychologists and medical professionals, as well as to others known to be versed in meditative practices, including my husband and me. In his pioneering spirit, the Rebbe urged us to develop acceptable meditation methodologies that would serve as tools for overcoming stress and anxiety, thereby replacing negative emotions with feelings of internal peace.</p>
<p>As I observe an increasing number of friends, family and acquaintances taking anti–anxiety or antidepressant medications, or struggling to keep an even keel in times of great economic and political turmoil, I feel compelled to re-examine this call from the Rebbe. More than ever, it has become crucial to help people learn appropriate techniques for stress reduction, and to explain why and how such practices are relevant to our lives. And it’s not just about overcoming negativity. Within these challenges lie thinly veiled opportunities to dramatically enhance the quality of our lives.</p>
<p>Human beings are endowed by their Creator with a spectacular and elaborate defense mechanism called the fight-or-flight response&#8230; </p>
<p>Many of us feel as though we are constantly under pressure&#8230;</p>
<p>When faced with chronic stress and an overactive limbic system&#8230; sooner or later we begin to see physical symptoms&#8230; </p>
<p>According to the Ramchal, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, rushing is the close ally of the yetzer hara (our negative, self-sabotaging inclination)&#8230;</p>
<p>How is it possible to survive, let alone thrive, in the midst of this sense of constant pressure? To gain access to our own abilities, to activate the best of ourselves rather than act from our least functional, habitual patterns of response, we first need to alter our perception and our perspective. Meditation—or perhaps mindfulness exercises that may not look like “meditation” per se—can put us on that path.</p>
<p>Meditation can help make those adjustments in our minds, our hearts, our nervous and endocrine systems, our emotions, our thoughts, and ultimately our souls. Meditation can be like a powerful telephoto lens that brings us closer to that which previously appeared distant and unknowable; by the same token, it can function like a wide-angle lens that affords us the perspective to see the cosmic connections in our universe. <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1442811/jewish/On-Mindfulness-and-Jewish-Meditation-Part-I.htm">Read the Rest Here</a> </p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The is a meme going around based on the Gallup poll that made religious Jews the happiest in the US. I have already received notices about rabbis planning on using it as their Sabbath sermon.</p>
<p>First off, stick to the religious polls by the groups that specialize in relgion like PEW because they are calibrated for religious groups.  Leave Gallup for exit polls on election night. The basic messages of the poll when read correctly is that it does not matter which religion and how much in term of happiness. The differences between different religions were only 3-4 % and between religious and non-religious 3-4%. But if you looked at the poll, it said that the Jewish statistics was accurate only to +/- 6% due to the small sample.  Did everyone fail statistics? The real factors are economics, freedom of mobility, religion, and job, health care, and class. Gallop uses a broad category like Protestant that includes together Boston Unitarians and Southern Fundamentalists blurs more than it reveals.  And secular Denmark remains the happiest country in the world by a much larger margin.</p>
<p>The funnier joke is that Orthodox Jews, even modern ones, confuse in the meme yinglish and English. A religious person is not an orthodox one. Religious does not mean frum. Rather religious means the same thing it means by Protestants.- Is your religion and house of worship important in your life? Do you make God a part of your life?  If a Christian Fundamentalist thought that liberal Protestants were not true believers, he might think that only Fundamentalists are included in the religious category and he would place the liberal Christians in the moderate or non-believer group. </p>
<p>Since this survey specifically sought to gather data from all fifty states then the majority of those Jews who said they are religious are Reform and Renewal, those who geographic distribution would fit a survey like this. When the Orthodox rabbis preach on this survey this Shabbos, they will be cheering on liberal Jews.</p>
<p>I am in contact with Reform Jews committed to Jewish causes. They all consider themselves religious without any dietary law observance They  have connections to Teaneck Orthodoxy through business or marriage.They once told me that in their community Teaneck is seen as “observant but not religious.” From their perspective, the observant Jews commit their heart, time, and soul to their secular lives. I assume that most of the Jews in the 50 states that they reached have similar perspectives about what it takes to be religious. </p>
<p>On the other hand and more germane to happiness, I have heard from local doctors that their haimish patients think that Teaneck is where the “doctors live and have happy lives.” I suppose the comfort level and the convenience looks mighty happy.</p>
<p>Any survey like this to be real needs to compare similar groups, if you can’t then you have not controlled the variables. At least once a year, you get these bogus studies by frum psychologists comparing Orthodoxy to the national average showing that Orthodoxy is amazing. You cannot compare someone in the top 6% to a national average. If you want to do a study it would have to compare like to like. You can compare upper middle class people in Franklin Lakes, or White Plains to people in Teaneck and ask about religiosity.<br />
From the studies on wellness and happiness done by people that I know for degrees in psych on their patient pool, the results actually show those with a fearful or rigid Orthodoxy are less on a wellness scale. And that issues in family life and adjustment play a bigger role. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Jews can finally be happy. It was not long ago that if you asked a Jew if he was happy or doing well, it would go like this:<br />
Jew #1 Are you doing well?<br />
Jew #2 Oy, Could be better. </p>
<p>Jew #1 Are you happy?<br />
Jew #2 Oy, I wouldn’t wish such happiness on my worst enemies.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it is interesting to see Orthodox Jews think that wellness are Jewish values. They never were Jewish values. They are not the values of prior ages and are entirely of our zeitgeist. (Discussions of badhan’s at weddings, needing to overcome melancholia, and medieval discussions of eudemonia are not modern happiness).The happiness of wellbeing is not purim joy. The Vilna Gaon in cited in the Hemdat Genuzah as defining external pleasure (simhah) in contrast to internal pleasure (sasson). But I am not sure that even there it would be well-being as on a modern wellness survey. I am leaving Breslov out of the discussion because the real tormented master is far from mizvah gedolah lehiot be simchah. I am not sure that Breslov sinchah corresponds to wellness.  Wellness and this form of happiness may be closer to a hokhmah, a worldly wisdom in Maimonides (III:52) and R. Israel Salanter. I still need to think about other potential sources.</p>
<p>Aish Hatorah is busy producing videos and articles on Judaism and happiness – in fifty years we will look upon this happiness and Judaism in the same way as we look at the 1950s “Democracy and Torah” “American Liberty and Torah” as a quaint product of its time. But that is Aish, what about all the rabbis who plan on mentioning it this Shabbos in shul? But since when is well-being a Jewish virtue? If there was a statistic that said religious Jews are the best boxers, Would it become a religious virtue? Is it a religious virtue to “Don’t worry be happy” Are those rabbis who are giving the sermon living a life of be happy?</p>

				<p>Has anyone in my readership attended? How is <em>Maavor Yabbok</em> explained for our age? Does it integrate contemporary spirituality or does it fly in the face of it to seek a traditional hesed shel emet? Looking at the schedules of the prior conferences it seems a mixture of practice, traditional thinking, and modern spirituality. The early conferences had Maurice Lamm and Benjamin Blech, they all have Simcha Raphael who wrote Jewish view of the Afterlife. I have dealt with some of this before on <a href="../../2010/02/25/zavin-adar/index.html">Zayin Adar-Hevra Kadisha</a> and <a href="../../2010/02/06/contemporary-orthodox-death/index.html">Contemporary Orthodox Death.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size:medium;">The  Chevra Kadisha and Jewish Cemetery Conference is two days &#8212; June 12-14  &#8212; of intense learning focused on the end of life continuum. From  bikkur cholim, to tahara and shmira, funeral and burial and mourning,  this conference allows every participant to immerse in the knowledge,  resources, texts, and discussions vital to working in their own  community. </span><span style="font-size:medium;"><br />
Don&#8217;t miss the &#8220;live&#8221; tahara demo,  halacha of intermarried burials, active listening, marketing traditional  funerals and burials, infection control, history of the Jewish Sacred  Society, autopsy and medical examiners, non-profit funeral homes,  transgender issues, cemetery consecration, Maavor Yabbok text study,  healing, cemetery finances, bereavement photography, genealogy, cemetery  regulators and much more. </span> <span style="font-size:medium;">Plus lots of  networking, discussing, strategizing, sharing and supporting.</span><br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>David Brooks has a new book and his lingo usually gets picked up by the rest of the media. He coined red/blue states, bohemia bourgeois, and polydoxy.<br />
His new book basically says that we have intuitions, feelings, habits, and reactions that make them have a happy successful life. An unreflected middlebrow upper middle class life style teaches one to get the right schooling and connections, create the right home life, and join a house of worship. By doing this one has the good life.</p>
<p>I find this interesting because I just wrote a paper saying the exact same things about the construction of Centrist Orthodoxy. They know how to go through life for a good life. They have tuned out intellectual and ideological issues and focus on the community and family. Culturally they are happy with a lake Woebegone smug shallowness, Brooks uses all the books that I have discussed on the blog and in my paper– Putnam, Christian Smith, Bourdieu,- and creates a synthesis. I have no such synthesis, but Brooks goes off into speculative neuroscience.</p>
<p>Brooks simultaneously makes fun of the composure class and holds them up as a model. I have the same problem that describing the Centrist community one cant help but point out their foibles. Brooks tells his story as comic and ironic. I, more influenced by frum Christians, tell the story with a greater sense of paradox, concern, and rejection- searching for something deeper in life.  Brooks takes out all the problems and issues and see this shallowness as the peak of life. The Victorian family, the 1920’s Middletown, the Eishenhower era, and now the composure class (or consumer class) are models of conservative life.</p>
<blockquote><p>David Brooks&#8217; new book, The Social Animal, follows the lives of two extremely contented grown-ups.<br />
&#8220;This is the happiest story you&#8217;ve ever read,&#8221; it announces. &#8220;It&#8217;s about two people who led wonderfully fulfilling lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re cynical, this probably sounds repellent. But thankfully, these two people turn out to be fictional. And the book&#8217;s subtitle, &#8220;The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement,&#8221; is misleading. The Social Animal doesn&#8217;t reveal &#8220;hidden&#8221; formulas at all. Rather, it&#8217;s a giant parable about the power of our unconscious. It suggests how we might improve ourselves and our world by understanding how we really think.</p>
<p>In the tradition of Rousseau, Brooks illustrates this through narrative. He invents two characters, Harold and Erica whom we follow from childhood to grave. Along the way, we meet Harold&#8217;s parents, his roommate, Erica&#8217;s coworkers, even a wildly charismatic presidential candidate named, of all things, Grace.</p>
<p>Watching their lives unfold, we&#8217;re treated to commentary about how and why these characters behave and believe as they do.<br />
Brooks has a terrific sense of humor, too, but it&#8217;s oddly deployed here. The </p>
<p>Social Animal opens with a wicked parody of cultural elitism — or what Brooks calls the &#8220;Composure Class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny? Absolutely.<br />
But this class seems to be the very group that Harold and Erica wind up in. By veering into satire, Brooks muddies his intentions. Are we supposed to admire his characters, or mock them? Empathize, or view them as cautionary tales?<br />
Strangest of all, for a book that claims to be about our &#8220;emotional&#8221; inner realm, there&#8217;s little if it depicted here. Neither Harold nor Erica suffers from the daily insecurities, compulsions, and anxieties that plague most real people. The biggest emotional challenges in their lives — children, infidelity, aging — are glossed over in a few pages. Mostly, Harold and Erica face concrete, defined problems — which they solve promptly, using street smarts and research.<br />
Instructive?</p>
<p>Yes. But irritating! For all its intelligence and imagination, Brooks&#8217; narrative suffers from its own lack of real suffering. </p></blockquote>
<p>This description below could just as well describe the Centrist Orthodox community.Here is his pitch why we all need the strong support system of community and religion. Note his new word limerence. Let’s see how long before it catches on. </p>
<blockquote><p>In essence, The Social Animal is a book about the human need for connection, friendship, love—what Brooks identifies as “limerence.” Behind the elaborate theorizing is Brooks’s desire to articulate a universal feeling: that all of us are caught up in what he calls “the loneliness loop.” We yearn for “community”; we have “the urge to merge.” When two people are having an intense conversation, their breathing synchronizes; laughing together creates a feeling of joy; soldiers drilling in unison experience a surge of power. What drives us, ultimately, is the need to be understood by others.</p>
<p>And the odd thing was, they weren&#8217;t born geniuses. They did okay on the SAT and IQ tests and that sort of thing, but they had no extraordinary physical or mental gifts. They were fine-looking, but they weren&#8217;t beautiful. They played tennis and hiked, but even in high school they weren&#8217;t star athletes, and nobody would have picked them out at that young age and said they were destined for greatness in any sphere. Yet they achieved this success, and everyone who met them sensed that they lived blessed lives.</p>
<p>How did they do it? They possessed what economists call noncognitive skills, which is the catchall category for hidden qualities that can&#8217;t be easily counted or measured, but which in real life lead to happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<p>First, they had good character. They were energetic, honest, and dependable. They were persistent after setbacks and acknowledged their mistakes. They possessed enough confidence to take risks and enough integrity to live up to their commitments. They tried to recognize their weaknesses, atone for their sins, and control their worst impulses.<br />
Just as important, they had street smarts. They knew how to read people, situations, and ideas. You could put them in front of a crowd, or bury them with a bunch of reports, and they could develop an intuitive feel for the landscape before them </p></blockquote>
<p>Of the dozen reviews that were posted on the day the book came out, the Christian Science Monitor had the most critical review. As someone who has posted on this new social science, only the CSM noted that Brooks left out the problems discussed in the recent volumes.  If the upper middle class is having fun then they have weaker family ties, which are needed for happiness than the lower middle class. My observed answer is that the religious community substitutes for family. What about the stress of upper middle class life?  Brooks has no answer. What about the lack of interest in books or high culture by this consumer composure class? Brooks himself in his article bemoans the loss of the middleclass acknowledgment of highbrow. If his fictional characters Harold and Erica are happier watching Purim youtube video than study, then how do you get them back to highbrow or serious religion? </p>
<p>The debate between culture and politics is a serious question. The recently departed Shmuel Eisenstadt taught that everything was culture. The new generation of Israeli sociologist chose politics. </p>
<blockquote><p>In &#8220;The Social Animal&#8221; Brooks approvingly cites the words of the late Democratic senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan: “The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.” The creator of Harold and Erica aligns himself with the Federalism of Alexander Hamilton and the progressivism of Teddy Roosevelt, when he argues for “limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility,” and he supports policy initiatives like early childhood education and charter schools that paternalistically “reshape the internal models” and install “achievement values” in the minds of the poor.</p>
<p>He also takes a surprisingly nearsighted view of how value is distributed along the socioeconomic ladder. The 2002 General Social Survey found, for example, that as people internalize “achievement values” and move into the middle class their relationships with extended family attenuate. This is partly because people in the middle class are more mobile and tend to live farther from their kin. But it also happens for more fundamental reasons: University of Pennsylvania and Brooks-approved sociologist Annette Lareau has shown that the individualism of middle class life tends to devalue ties with extended family. These are the relationships that Brooks says are so essential for happiness, but &#8220;The Social Animal&#8221; is too assured of itself to linger on such contradictions.</p>
<p>Their story lets Brooks mock the affluent and trendy while advancing soft neoconservative themes: that genetically ingrained emotions and biases trump reason; that social problems require cultural remedies (charter schools, not welfare payments); that the class divide is about intelligence, deportment, and taste, not money or power. </p></blockquote>

				<p>We will take a break for a day from the Landes/Green debate.</p>
<p>Here is a report that early 20th century metaphysics and theosophy are on the decline. In its place are new age, wicca, and yoga. Most of the places that we still see metaphysics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought">New Thought</a> is in Aish Hatorah thinking like that Rabbi Adam Jacobs over at Huffington Post or the <a href="../../2010/04/11/menachem-ekstein-visions-of-a-compassionate-world-a-post-hasid/index.html">meditations of Rabbi Menachem Eckstein </a>currently beloved by the hilltop youth. Swedenborg Church and metaphysical Unitarian are not in anymore. There is still a small metaphysical church on a residential street in Teaneck. </p>
<p>The author of the post notes that all time American theosophy is moving to the web or merging into new age. The metaphysical approach spoke of powers in the universe or higher energies or way to tap into evolution. in contract, new age stresses the personal, the human narrative, or individual seeking. Metaphysical approaches had one master the hidden wisdom, new age teaches one to look into oneself.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was recently reading the newest edition of <a href="http://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine" target="_blank">Quest</a>, the journal of the  Theosophical Society in America. In it, Robert Ellwood, muses about the  future of the society in an essay entitled, “<a href="http://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/2197" target="_blank">Theosophy  after the Baby Boomers</a>.” In the essay he notes that the membership  of the society has decreased from a high of 8,520 in 1927 to the current  3,546. These few members struggle to maintain the financial weight of  the society’s properties and infrastructure. Ellwood posits that at some  point if the organization can no longer continue in its existing form  it may shift to an educational foundation using diverse media to deliver  its lessons. He also points to the way the internet will be central to  this future.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>While some are organized by tradition, such as <a href="http://witchvox.com/" target="_blank">WitchVox</a>, which allows pagans worldwide  to meet and exchange messages and files&#8230; On this  website one can find local yoga, astrology, or alternative health  groups.<br />
The differences between various metaphysical traditions  are collapsing just as quickly as are the distinctions between religious  and secular institutions that many religion scholars study. The  boundaries between New Age practice, neopaganism, and yoga, for  instance, are quite porous, as are the designations between what is and  what is not religious.
