				<p>There is a really nice article about the generational shift in American Buddhism. The younger generation is more DIY and catering to people&#8217;s needs. They also dont see a need to live a sever life in a monastery as part of their training. The gen-x backlashed against the baby-boomer&#8217;s spirituality. The older generation were an elite that sought Enlightenment, the younger generation create a wellness and solution for stress.The article is longer and has a nice video by three elders reluctantly acknowledging the change. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=8,10328,0,0,1,0">American Buddhism facing generational shift</a><br />
By Rachel Zell, Associated Press, July 17, 2011</p>
<p>The meditation hall, also used as a meeting space, is where the luminaries of Buddhism in the West recently gathered to debate.<br />
The issue they were facing had been percolating for years on blogs, in Buddhist magazines and on the sidelines of spiritual retreats. It often played out as a clash of elders versus young people, the preservers of spiritual depth versus the alleged purveyors of &#8220;Buddhism-lite.&#8221; Organizers of the gathering wanted the finger-pointing to end. The future of American Buddhism was at stake, they said.<br />
So on a sweltering day at the Garrison Institute, a Buddhist retreat overlooking the Hudson River, the baby boomers who had popularized the tradition in the West met with younger leaders to tackle their differences.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can those of us who were pioneers in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, support them without getting in their way and let them know that they have our blessings and support?&#8221; said Jack Kornfield, a prominent Buddhist teacher who helped introduce mindfulness, or insight, meditation to the U.S. four decades ago.</p>
<p>Buddhism in America is at a crossroads. The best-known Buddhist leaders, mostly white converts who emerged from the counterculture and protest movements of the Vietnam era, are nearing retirement or dying. Charlotte Joko Beck, a pioneer of Zen practice in America, passed away in June.</p>
<p>The next generation of teachers is pushing in new directions, shaped by the do-it-yourself ethos of the Internet age and a desire to make Buddhism more accessible. Informal study groups are in; organizing around a single teacher is out. Unsettled elders worry that the changes could go too far and lose touch with tradition.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be one of the facts of life right now, not only in Buddhism, but in religion in general: it&#8217;s about mixing and matching,&#8221; said Zoketsu Norman Fischer, a longtime Zen priest, scholar and poet affiliated with the San Francisco Zen Center. &#8220;The freedom people feel that they have to experiment — how do you prevent that from becoming consumerist or completely superficial or dangerous?&#8221;<br />
In Asia, monastics generally lead Buddhism in roles shaped partly by their monarchical societies; in the U.S., the teachers are mostly lay people. Beyond the Dalai Lama, Buddhism is best known in the United States not for any particular clergyman, ritual or liturgy, but through mindfulness-based stress reduction, which adapts strategies from vipassana, or insight medi tation.</p>
<p>Yet, a vein of conservatism runs through American Buddhist communities.</p>
<p>Many American Buddhist pioneers spent a decade or more studying with masters in Thailand, India, Burma and Nepal before returning home to take on students. On their websites, U.S. teachers post photos of themselves as young women in saris, or young men draped in robes, their heads cleanly shaven, on the steps of overseas monasteries. They are handing over leadership to the first convert Buddhist generation that was trained almost entirely in the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prior generation was modeled after the monastic model, where the old guy was the abbot,&#8221; said the Rev. Jay Rinsen Weik, a recently ordained Zen priest, who leads the Toledo Zen Center in Ohio with his wife, Karen, who is also a Zen priest. &#8220;The last generation suffered from not being able to distinguish the personality of the guy and his dharma (teachings).&#8221;</p>
<p>For younger Americans, spending several years cloistered abroad, absorbing the cultural traditions of another country, seems not only unnecessary but counterproductive for reaching Westerners. Spring Washam, 37, a founding teacher of the East Bay Meditation Center in Oakland, which has brought Buddhism to poorer, more diverse neighborhoods, said the attendees at her center want support, connection and friendship.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people want to be happy in their lives,&#8221; Washam said. &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to be monastics.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the most startling developments for elders has been the formation of the Dharma Punx, who participated in the conference. The relatively new, popular movement mixes punk rock-inspired rebellion and Buddhism, seeing both as seeking freedom from suffering. Amid the grey hair and muted clothes of the attendees, the Dharma Punx stood out, with their tattoo-covered arms and T-shirts the color of traffic cones. The movement emerged from the work of Noah Levine, the son of American Buddhist author Stephen Levine. The younger Levine rediscovered Buddhism after a troubled youth; he and his colleagues have built a reputation for successfully bringing Buddhist practices into juvenile detention centers — a sign of the social activism that young Buddhists tie to their meditation practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all about adaptability,&#8221; said Vinny Ferraro, a Dharma Punx teacher, who said it would make no sense for him to &#8220;go off to a cave&#8221; and meditate for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;What attracts people is relevance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Youth is suffering. These are prime suffering years, but I need it in my language.&#8221;<br />
Whatever the elders think of these new approaches, they know they need the energy young innovators are bringing to the communities.<br />
In the 1980s and early &#8217;90s, few twenty- and thirty somethings took up Buddhism. Leaders attributed the problem to a 1980s&#8217; backlash against spiritual seeking and society&#8217;s focus in that era on accumulating wealth. (One Western convert at the Garrison Institute, who became a Tibetan monk, said that when he wore his robes in North America in the 1980s, he was treated like &#8220;a nut case.&#8221;) </p>

				<p>For some religion is a private affair or one done in devotion to textual study, but increasingly religious identity is connected to lobbying in Washington. I have mentioned many times that in a single row in synagogue &#8211; one can find one person interested in halkhic minutia in their life, another into Rav Nachman and a third interested in Lobbying in Washington.The three congregants have three different moral orders to their religion. This article is an indication that many of the significant clergy in our decade are into lobbying and politicking. I see many Roshei Yeshiva comfortable in this role as well as many pulpit rabbis &#8211; their commitment shares much with Archbishop Dolan&#8217;s political lobbying. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/11/22/religion-related-lobby-groups-thrive-in-washington-grew-5-times-in-40-years/">Religion-related lobby groups thrive in Washington</a>, grew 5 times in 40 years<br />
The number of religion-related lobbying groups in Washington has grown five-fold in the past 40 years, with their spending reaching almost $400 million annually, the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life latest study showed. It identified 212 groups, up from 158 a decade ago and 40 in 1970.<br />
Their collective budgets for lobbing efforts in Washington were estimated at $390 million a year. For 131 of the groups for which data could be obtained, median spending was $890,000 in 2009, down from $970,000 the year before.<br />
Forty groups accounted for the bulk of the spending, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which spent nearly $88 million in 2008, the last year for which data was provided.<br />
Also in 2008, the Family Research Council spent $14 million and the American Jewish Committee $13 million.<br />
In 2009, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops spent $27 million, Concerned Women for America $13 million, Bread for the World $11 million, the National Right to Life Committee $11 million and the Home School Legal Defense Association $11 million.<br />
Issues the various groups lobbied on included support of Israel, church-state issues, and religious rights.<br />
The Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life said in the report on Monday that other topics were bioethics, abortion, capital punishment, and end-of-life and family-marriage issues. Many of the groups also addressed international issues such as poverty.

				<p>The Princetonian had two interesting articles this week. One an interview with Prof. Martha Himmelfarb and tha nnouncement of the Rhodes scholarchip to Miriam Rosenbaum</p>
<p><em>The following is <a href="http://http/www.dailyprincetonian.com/2011/11/23/29443/">the third installment of “Keeping Faith,”</a> a six-part series of conversations between politics professor Robert George and University professors of various faiths.</em></p>
<div>By DAILY PRINCETONIAN STAFF</div>

<div id="article_content">
<div id="article_text">
<p><em>Martha Himmelfarb is a religion professor and practicing Jew. Her work focuses on religion in late antiquity, in particular the Jewish and Christian traditions.</em></p>
<p><strong>RG: The Holocaust certainly caused some Christians as well as some Jews to lose faith in God. People asked, “How could a loving God permit such a thing to occur?” For others, it deepened their faith, especially the witness of those who risked their own lives to help. What’s your sense of what it means to Jews today?</strong></p>
<p>MH: That’s a really interesting question. Let me just give you an example of something that I think has changed. The High Holiday Prayer Book that we’ve used on campus at the Conservative services for many years includes a section on the Day of Atonement, the martyrology section, that traditionally involved reading an account of the Roman Rabbi Akiva and the other Jewish martyrs killed by the Romans under Hadrian.</p>
<p><strong>RG: Yes, I know it well from attending the services.</strong></p>
<p>MH: So you could imagine that that wasn’t necessarily the most meaningful thing to 20th-century Jews.</p>
<p><strong>RG: Because it’s so distant?</strong></p>
<p>MH: Yes, in part. I think after the Holocaust, people felt, we’ve really experienced something so recently that shouldn’t we somehow incorporate it into the synagogue service? And the attempts to do that, while completely understandable, were often so heavy-handed. To me, Judaism is a living tradition that has beautiful things to offer, and we shouldn’t be invoking persecution and death to explain why it’s meaningful. Having said that, I also have to say, it’s this great, irreducible tragedy that, as you say, raises the most profound questions. I was talking a couple of minutes ago about the emergence of the state of Israel so soon after the Holocaust. And this has been interpreted as kind of a narrative of death and resurrection. There is certainly something to that. On the other hand, I must also say that it’s dangerous to view any kind of political state in messianic terms. Part of the problem with viewing the state of Israel as the first flowering of redemption is that it suggests also that the Holocaust was somehow part of the plan of redemption.</p>
<p><strong>RG: In your own Jewish life, how do you understand and experience the idea of the Jews as God’s chosen people? Some people see this as chauvinistic, but it certainly isn’t meant to be.</strong></p>
<p>MH: According to the prophets, being chosen means being held to a higher standard. Ideally, you set some kind of example. So the prophets give you resources for thinking about it in a way that emphasizes responsibility rather than privilege. I certainly feel privileged, lucky and sometimes I would say blessed to have been born into a tradition that I think is so rich and nourishing. I suspect, had I been born into some other tradition, I would have found resources in that one that were very beautiful also. I guess, let me just say, the flip side of Jewish particularism is that it actually makes a lot of room for everybody else, which is to say God picked Jews to be this way, but it doesn’t mean that other people shouldn’t be the way that they are. So I guess that’s one view.</p>
<p><strong>RG: But Judaism is not a relativistic religion either, is it? There is, for example, the prayer that looks forward to the day when all nations will recognize the God of Israel and worship Him alone.</strong></p>
<p>MH: Actually, that’s the concluding prayer of every service daily. Yes, the teaching is that on that day he will be one and his name will be one. So he will be the God of everybody on that day. It is an eschatological teaching.</p>
<p><strong>RG: And somehow the chosenness of the Jewish people as it’s presented, at least in the prayer book, seems to have something to do with that day’s coming, that the Jewish example — being “a light unto the Gentiles,” as Isaiah says — is crucial to the rest of the world.</strong></p>
<p>MH: I think that’s right. And perhaps it’s a bit imperialistic that, in the end, everybody will sort of get it and join up. But it’s a very strong strand in the Bible’s thought.</p>
<p><strong>RG: Martha, could we shift to the question of messianism, the Jewish messianic hope? What does it mean to look forward to the coming of the Messiah?</strong></p>
<p>MH: I have to say, I find that a very hard one. I suppose that’s because I’m a bit of a pessimist. I feel it as a very distant hope.</p>
<p><strong>RG: Something too good to be true?</strong></p>
<p>MH: Well, I guess we could ask: Which is more contrary to reason, that God will bring his Messiah at the end of days or that human beings will get there by themselves? It’s probably less contrary to reason than to say that God will bring a Messiah at the end of days. But that horizon, I must say, I find a difficult one. I guess the thing that I find myself worrying about is, will there be Jews 200, 300 years from now? And where is Judaism going? And this is maybe a particularly worrying topic for an American Jew like me, who doesn’t belong in the orthodox world but still embraces religious observance.</p>
<p><strong>RG: Well, that takes us to the question of assimilation.</strong></p>
<p>MH: Absolutely. My grandmother, who never belonged to a synagogue, once said all her friends were Jewish because those were just the people they knew. So here was a woman, the beginning part of the 20th century, who was kind of purposely secular. But everybody she knew was Jewish. Today, some very observant Jewish students at Princeton have a wide range of non-Jewish friends. It took a generation or two for Jews to become fully mainstream in America, but it is the beauty of America that it’s never had anything like the anti-Semitism there was in Europe. Has there been prejudice? Sure, but not on the same scale.</p>
<p><strong>RG: As you know, I was a great admirer of your father, [Jewish sociographer] Milton Himmelfarb, who influenced my own thought, especially on issues of religion and society. He severely criticized the once-prevalent notion that the secularization of the larger society would be in the best interests of the Jews. He thought that, in America, Jews would do better when religion generally flourished.</strong></p>
<p>MH: Yes, he did have a kind of optimism, which I keep reminding myself about, a love for America and really an optimism about the Jewish future in America, even with all the difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>RG: He was also concerned that secularization would have the effect of secularizing Jews, not just everybody else. Now there does seem to be some of that happening. But there also seems to be a revival of interest in Judaism as a religion that offers a relationship with God. You see it here at Princeton and among Jewish young people generally.</strong></p>
<p>MH: It’s part of a larger phenomenon. People thought there was no way to reverse secularization. It turned out they were profoundly wrong. The Jewish case is distinctive, but I think it does certainly need to be understood as part of that larger picture that includes Christians and Muslims and perhaps others as well.</p>
<p><strong>RG: Final question, Martha. You, as a professional scholar, study Judaism. And it’s also your personal religious faith and practice. Does that ever create a tension?</strong></p>
<p>MH: Well, when you study ancient Judaism, a lot of the other people studying it are Jews, and probably the rest of them are Christians, more or less. So everybody, if you want, is bringing some kind of personal baggage. I do hope that I’m able to engage in scholarly work in as objective a way as possible. Studying the Jews is just very fascinating and fulfilling to me. I hope that, nonetheless, I’m able to do it in a way that doesn’t reflect a particular agenda. <a href="http://http/www.dailyprincetonian.com/2011/11/23/29443/">Read the Rest Here.</a></p>
<p>The other story in the same issue was a presentation of this year&#8217;s award winners include Rosenbaum who comes from an Orthodox family.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rosenbaum is a student in the Wilson School interested in health equity and healthcare policy. Coming from the Bronx, N.Y., Rosenbaum grew up in an orthodox Jewish community. Her religious background has informed her scholarly and extracurricular pursuits, which revolve around topics of ethics.</p>
<p>On campus, she is president of SHARE and was a co-chair of the Religious Life Council, Princeton’s interfaith dialogue group. After she graduates, she plans to study bioethics for two years at Oxford, then return to the University to pursue a master’s degree in public affairs.</p>
<p>Rosenbaum said that she hopes she will be able to use the ethics training and economic public affairs training she will receive at Oxford to “be an advocate for populations that are generally marginalized.”</p>
<p>Some of the questions she wants to explore include “what you fund, and what do you not fund, specifically what happens with marginalized populations that often are the most expensive — the elderly and the disabled,” she explained.</p>
<p>Wilson School visiting professor Hugh Price, who worked with Rosenbaum in his task force last year, praised Rosenbaum’s passion for learning and her devotion to topics that interest her.</p>
<p>“I think what’s really striking is her search for knowledge and how she goes above and beyond the call of duty to understand and research issues, read materials that aren’t required for the course, and attend symposia that are not part of the curriculum of the course,” he said in an email. “She even reads the New England Journal of Medicine in her spare time, which is quite remarkable.” <a href="http://http/www.dailyprincetonian.com/2011/11/21/29413/">Read the Rest Here </a></p></blockquote>

				<p>Moshe Idel gave a interesting series of lectures last winter on the power of language, specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Arte_Combinatoria">arts combinatoria,</a> a ability to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis">universal knowledge from language.</a> The audio was recently posted. The second lecture on Derrida, Eco, and Culiano give insight into Idel himself.  Idel&#8217;s use of a single line of Derrida to show affinity to his own project is an old theme for him. But new is Idel&#8217;s highlighting that Culiano at the end of his life turned from the study of phenomena to theory, with an implication that this lecture of his was his own turn to theory. These &#8220;theory lectures&#8221; seem to have already been implicit in his recent work on <em>Kabbalah in Italy.</em></p>
<p>But were these three thinkers his inspiration right from the start in the 1980&#8217;s? It seems they were, but not explicitly. Does anyone remember any relevant passages? If Idel now lists himself and Kabbalah as the study of (the power of) language and magic- Is this a change or implicit already in his PhD? His work from a few years ago <em>Absorbing Perfections</em> still used the words mysticism and esotericism. Can we reread the entire Idel project as disconnected from mysticism and see that it was originally language and magic (as well as esotericism and ecstatic techniques)?</p>
<p>Idel&#8217;s first self-written book was the published version of his dissertation on Abulafia where he wrote as an opening paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The method for attaining wisdom proposed by Abulafia as an alternative to philosophical speculation is essentially a linguistic one.Language is conceived by him as a universe in itself, which yields aricher and superior domain for contemplation than does the natural world</p></blockquote>
<p>He was telling us right from the start that he is concerned with language as a means to wisdom. Can his project be re-read as knowledge through language? As a side point, am I the only one bothered that Idel ignores how Leibnitz criticized the medieval attempts as arbitrary and not scientific, while Idel glides from the modern to the medieval without a break?</p>
<p>In the same recent lecture Idel claimed that history and causality is over-rated; there are other sources of knowledge. He dismisses Thomas Kuhn &amp; Feyerabend for not recognizing the role of Ars Combinatoria, the recombination of letters as a valid source of knowledge. Eco and Derrida through their interest in ars combinatoria have transcended the Enlightenment interest in science and &#8220;clear and distinct ideas.&#8221; Idel applauds this. Unlike the limited knowledge offered by theosophic kabbalah such as the Zohar or Ari, or the limited knowledge offered through science, the knowledge of the magical recombination of letters contains all the knowledge of the universe.This would explain why he has never attempted any historical narrative or intellectual history. But it also seems to assume that Idel thinks contemporary readers will resonate with Abulafia, or at least Idel&#8217;s books, since Eco is on the best-seller list. And if Eco if read itis because people are beyond history and science.</p>

				<p>In the Rietbeg Museum in Zurich they are having an exhibit on mysticism, including Jewish mysticism. The website has lots of uploaded pictures and video, however only some of them have English subtitles. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rietberg.ch/en-gb/exhibitions/mysticism.aspx">MYSTICISM &#8211; YEARNING FOR THE ABSOLUTE</a><br />
23 SEPTEMBER 2011 TO 15 JANUARY 2012<br />
The Museum Rietberg is proud to present the world&#8217;s first culturally comparative exhibition on mysticism.</p>
<p>This elusive religious phenomenon will be illustrated by the example of forty male and female mystics: their lives and writings demonstrate just how richly varied spiritual experience can be. The mystics chosen for the exhibition come from the great religions of the world &#8211; Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity &#8211; and span the period from the 6th century BC until the 19th century.</p>
<p>Here are two of the Jewish exhibits, the one for the Besht has the same display as the Ramak.<br />
<a href="http://www.rietberg.ch/en-gb/exhibitions/mysticism/judentum/abulafia.aspx">ABRAHAM ABULAFIA (1240-1291) EXPERIENCE OF GOD IN THE HOLY LANGUAGE</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rietberg.ch/en-gb/exhibitions/mysticism/judentum/cordovero.aspx">MOSES CORDOVERO (1522-1570) RE-ESTABLISHING UNITY</a></p>
<p>Some of the other one&#8217;s that are interesting is the little film for <a href="http://www.rietberg.ch/en-gb/exhibitions/mysticism/christentum/dionysios.aspx">Dionysios THE AREOPAGITE</a> and the recording of <a href="http://http/www.rietberg.ch/en-gb/exhibitions/mysticism/islam/rumi.aspx">Rumi in Persian.</a></p>

				<p>Broadcasts on Jewish Philosophy at PHILOSOPHER&#8217;S ZONE.<br />
Australian Radio Series on Jewish Philosophy with transcripts</p>
<div> Including the following programmes:</div>
<div id="post-body-2666551541934500066">
<ul>
<li>Overview 1: We begin this series with an introduction to Jewish philosophy, from Ancient times onwards &#8211; an attempt to explore some of the key thinkers and recurring philosophical questions. Our guide is Tamar Rudavsky from Ohio State University (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318686.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318686.htm</a>);</li>
<li>Overview 2: in part two of our introduction we take up the story during the 17th century, with the great European thinker Baruch Spinoza. Tamar Rudavsky from Ohio State University is again our guide (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318715.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318715.htm</a>);</li>
<li>Maimonides: Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon, also known as Maimonides, became a hugely important figure in that great era of Moorish cultural flourishing, 12th century Spain (Cordoba). Maimonides adapted the ideas of Aristotle, was a significant influence on Thomas Aquinas, and became one of the leading Rabbinical scholars of his time, and perhaps of all time Steven Nadler of University of Wisconsin-Madison (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318761.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318761.htm</a>);</li>
<li>Moses Mendelssohn: Moses Mendelssohn scandalised his more pious fellow 18th century Germans when he said: &#8216;My religion recognises no obligation to resolve doubt other than through rational means; and it commands no mere faith in eternal truths.&#8217; This week we look at the life and ideas of one of the great proponents of Judaism as a rational religion -Michah Gottlieb of NYU <br />
(<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318825.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318825.htm</a>);</li>
<li>Martin Buber: Martin Buber was born in pre-Nazi Austria and emigrated to Israel in 1938 where he spent much of the rest of his life. He grappled with Zionism, Jewish thought, secular philosophy and politics and the result is a body of thought very much based on relationships Paul Mendes-Flohr of University of Chicago (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318843.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3318843.htm</a>).</li>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Yesterday morning, I received by email <a href="http://listserv.os.biu.ac.il/cgi-bin/wa?A2=LOOKSTEIN;dbad79ab.1111">the new issue of Bookjed.</a> Steve Bayme of the AJC wrote a review of a book and in the middle of the review inserts the following paragraph explaining what he thinks are the limits of Modern Orthodoxy. It seemed like a ready-made argument that can apply to a lot of topics.</p>
<blockquote><p>More generally, this small volume stands as a significant document illustrating the tenuous place Modern Orthodoxy occupies on the Jewish communal map. To invoke a metaphor, Modern Orthodox leaders frequently approach the edge of the water but fail to wade into it. The authors comprehend the significance and beauty of sexuality and articulate it quite well. They are informed by secular sources of knowledge and culture. They understand fully that there are significant points of tension between Judaic heritage and modern culture. But they appear unwilling to confront those tensions openly. I should add, in fairness to the authors, that the same might be said for Orthodox leaders with respect to questions of Biblical scholarship, cooperation with the non-Orthodox movements, Jewish gentile relations, problems of reason and faith, the meaning of revelation for moderns, and doubtless one could easily add to this list. My personal favorite concerned a leading Modern Orthodox professor of Judaic Studies, who developed a popular lecture for synagogue scholar in residence programs in which he claimed that archeological research corroborated the Biblical narrative as if there were no conflicts between archeology and Torah. One only hopes he has abandoned the lecture given the weight of recent archeological research!<br />
Instructors willing to go beyond the book and “enter the waters” fully will be doing themselves and their students a great service. They may even create models that Modern Orthodox leaders would do well to emulate.</p></blockquote>
