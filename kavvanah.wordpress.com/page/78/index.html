				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Rabbi Yehuda Leon Ashkenazi,  (also known as Manitou, 1922- 1996) was one of the leading educators and thinkers of post WWII French Jewry. He was a descendant of the Lurianic Kabbalist Joseph ibn Tabul and the Talmudic commentator, the Rosh.  He studied Kabbalah in his native North Africa and later under the influence of  Rav Zvi Yehuda Kook and Rav Baruch Ashlag. He studied philosophy, psychology, and anthropology in the University of Algiers, and in the Sorbonne in Paris.</p>
<p>Rabbi Ashkenazi along with Andre Neher and Emmanuel Levinas served as educational directors of the Jewish school system. In 1957, they organized the Annual French Jewish Intellectuals Conferences, which  sought to create an academic, philosophical language for understanding the Torah and Jewish culture. Those attending his lectures included a who’s who of younger French Jews, including Prof Benny Gross and Rabbi Shlomo Aviner</p>
<p>In the last five years, at least five of Ashkenazi&#8217;s works have appeared in Hebrew. Another half dozen books recently came out in French. </p>
<p>Ashkenazi was active in inter-religion encounter traveling often to give lectures around Europe and Asia. Notably, Ashkenazi was a perenniaist, who saw a common primordial core to all religions. He composed a prayer for the dedication of  the Sanctuaire de l’Universel, a Parisian multi-faith venture of the  Universal Sufi Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan. Ashkenazi, however, considered this core as the Judaism taught by Abraham of morals and monotheism, rather than a generic theism. He sees that Jews and Christians share the Bible and its values, but differ in the interpretation by means of Talmud and New Testament.  After Vatican Two, since Jews are not accused of deicide, the the rivalry between Judaism and Christianity can now end. An open dialogue would be when learn to honor and respect Jewish teachings.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bible of the Jews and the Christians is the same Bible… Any differences in our theologies and interpretations do not originate in the Bible… It is not the Jewish and Christian Bibles that oppose one another but rather the Talmudist and the Evangelist, who turn their backs on one another and never communicate. If this dialogue were to open one day, it would be the day that the Christians recognize and respect the Jews as creatures worthy of love of living things and especially the day Christians recognize the honor of Judaism, whose seal is truth.  </p>
<p>Our theologies are highly polarized, but there are points of interface regarding ethics.  </p>
<p>It was a deicidal nation, an expression that has been rejected since Vatican II. The Church purported to be the New Israel, but mutual recognition brings the rivalry between identities to an end. </p></blockquote>
<p> Ashekenazi tries to stick close to Rabbinic categories. First and Second century Jews who became Christians are sectarians (<em>minim</em>), those of gentile decent, which are most of today’s Christians have no contention to the life of Jesus.</p>
<p><em>There is a basic misunderstanding. Contemporary Christians and Jews present themselves as if they were living in the Generation of the Dissociation [the Second Temple Era]—rendering dialogue impossible but so essential. </p>
<p>For us, today’s Jews, Christians are not false witness. They are simply not witnesses at all. They do not represent anything that we did not understand or that we rejected as alien to our mission. Similarly, Christianity is not responsible for the formulation of its faith. Christians inherited it from their sages…<br />
Had they been Jews, the authentic heirs to the covenant, they would be considered idolaters who bear a message of apostasy… They would be like any other Jew who violates the covenant… </em></p>
<p>Askenazi’s approach to dialogue with Christians was not to start with one’s existential attitude of either closeness or non-reconcilable faith commitments. Neither did he start with the theological differences. Rather, one needs to jointly read scripture and grapple with the fundamental tension of the Bible as historical reality and revelation as opposed to a private faith act. Ashkenazi applies that dichotomy to contemporary events and favors the approach of historical reality since he sees God’s hand in the 20th century Jewish experience and attests that many Christians support Israel since they also see it as Divine providence.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dialogue at the attitude level has no meaning. This is not the place for opinions, but rather for reading the Book [the Bible] and designating the realities associated with the reading. The problem should not be limited to focus on philosophical issues that ostensibly differ in said religions. Perhaps instead of discussing it would be better to think? On the one hand, historical reality: the Hebrew nation and its history as formulated in the Bible—the ‘Old Testament’ to Christians—through prophetic revelation vs. the founding myth as a matter of faith and not identity or existence.  </p>
<p>The long duration of a two-thousand year parting, the horrors of the Holocaust and the shock of the Christian soul and admission of responsibility for anti-Semitism, the fact of the Ingathering of Exiles, recognition of the State of Israel by most world nations—cannot leave the believing person indifferent. And I know many Christians who attest that they have interpreted the incidents as follows: This is Divine Providence at work. Let us help it succeed, with humility and prayer. </p></blockquote>

				<p><strong>The Fourth International Conference on the Philosophy of Halakhah – </strong><strong>Halakhah as an Event</strong> Tuesday-Wednesday, 28-29 December 2010<br />
<a href="http://www.vanleer.org.il/Data/UploadedFiles/Files/halakhah_event_eng.jpg">jpeg of Program Here</a><br />
The conference will focus on philosophical analyses of the event of the halakhic entity. Can the knowledge concealed in action and the body of the actor be revealed? What is the gap between the knowledge gathered from theoretical writings and the knowledge gleaned from the halakhic act and the Halakhic event? Does Halakhah change because of the dynamics connected to action rather than due to halakhic theory? What new insights about Halakhah have arisen given the halakhic actor’s awareness about body issues, his senses, and his movements?<br />
A study group on &#8221; Halakhah as an Event&#8221;undertook in 2009 an innovative study of the way Halakhah came into being, focusing on the philosophy of the praxis, not only on the theory, as has been common hitherto. </p>
<p><strong>The Second Conference is at Ben Gurion University on Levinas and the Bible</strong><br />
There is a <a href="http:///hsf.bgu.ac.il/cjt/files/levinas/program.html">program</a> and <a href="http://hsf.bgu.ac.il/cjt/files/levinas/levinas_abstracts.html">abstracts.</a></p>
<p>The conference aims at fostering two main sets of problems.  One set of queries focuses on Levinas&#8217;s references to biblical figures, and raises questions about the role these figures play in Levinas&#8217;s philosophy.  In this context the conference will question whether the biblical figures function merely as a rhetorical and literary device, as illustrations of Levinas&#8217;s ideas, or perhaps they have a deeper philosophical function that contributes to Levinas&#8217;s project in general.  The conference will also discuss if Levinas&#8217;s references to biblical figures work in his philosophy in a way that other literary figures are incapable of, and how do these references comply with his conflicted attitude towards literature.  </p>
<p>The second set of questions stems from adopting a Levinasian perspective in order to interpret the actions and stories of biblical figures that are not necessarily discussed by Levinas himself.  This will lead to questions such as:  Does Levinas&#8217;s thought open up a unique way for understanding biblical figures and their stories? What is the relation between Levinas&#8217;s interpretation and the traditional midrash? Does a Levinasian reading contribute to the tradition of midrashim and exegesis revealing ways to enhance and enrich these interpretations?  </p>
<p>These questions will set up the background for a broader discussion of the relation between the two main traditions that have influenced Levinas&#8217;s thought – philosophy and Judaism, and for the examination of the intersection between philosophy, Judaism, and literature. </p>
<p><strong>Ben Gurion held a Conference this past June on</strong> <strong>Belief and Doubt. </strong> They just uploaded the recording.</p>
<p>The speakers include: Moshe Halbertal,  James Kugel, Moshe Lichtenstein, Ruth Calderon, Marc B. Shapiro,  Menachem Kellner.<br />

				<p>New Book on Walter Benjamin<br />
Here is <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=5512084">the publisher&#8217;s blurb:</a></p>
<p><em>Seven decades after his death, German Jewish writer, philosopher, and literary critic Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) continues to fascinate and influence. Here Uwe Steiner offers a comprehensive and sophisticated introduction to the oeuvre of this intriguing theorist.</p>
<p>Acknowledged only by a small circle of intellectuals during his lifetime, Benjamin is now a major figure whose work is essential to an understanding of modernity. Steiner traces the development of Benjamin’s thought chronologically through his writings on philosophy, literature, history, politics, the media, art, photography, cinema, technology, and theology.. Steiner contends, can best be appreciated by placing Benjamin in his proper context as a member of the German philosophical tradition and a participant in contemporary intellectual debates.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/books/54650/gathering-storm/">From Tablet Review: </a></p>
<p><em>In the last five years, more than 300 books and articles on Walter Benjamin have appeared in English alone<br />
Uwe Steiner’s new book  on Benjamin—which attempts to put Benjamin in his historical place—doesn’t really do him justice either.<br />
A Klee painting named Angelus Novus] shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.<br />
A beautiful piece of writing that gets an extra kick from its pessimistic counter-intuitive punch line. Progress doesn’t progress in the slightest. It is a steady march through disaster. And there is nothing, it seems, we can do about it.<br />
Benjamin claimed that his work was saturated with theology, even—or rather especially—when it appears to be at its most secular. In the piece that contains the Angel, the revolution fulfills a theological mandate by making “whole what has been smashed.” Benjamin imagines that it will enact tikkun olam in a very literal sense. Benjamin’s colleague, the philosopher Max Horkheimer, once accused him of believing all too squarely in the Last Judgment.<br />
Benjamin’s thought was essentially religious. It clung to the twin promises of redemption and transcendence. The man worked from the clearly Jewish intuition that justice cannot be derived from the world as it is. Justice is precisely that small break from nature instituted by the Law. Our problem is not that nature is sinful. Our problem lies with the fact that on its own, nature just isn’t enough. It needs to be transcended, if only just a bit. As his friend T. W. Adorno was fond of reminding us, the Talmud says that the redeemed world will be like this one, but a little different. And that tiny shift means everything.</p>
<p>But what happens when we, as the children of modernity, have lost the Law? That is where Benjamin’s messianic politics slip in. Gershom Scholem, the magisterial historian of Kabbalah, always maintained that Benjamin was a Jewish thinker and not really a Marxist. For his part, Benjamin argued that he pursued a single goal—the radical transformation of the world, a utopian strike against suffering. His was not the tikkun olam of good deeds and incremental improvements, but of bold risks and decisive moves.<br />
Sure, sure, there is a great deal of Romanticism in all this (as Steiner would be the first to point out) and a sentimentalizing anarchism that speaks of another era. Even so, Benjamin proposes a heresy we might want to consider: redemption without faith. He refuses to give up the rigors and promises of theology for a more amenable, even amiable ethical Judaism. He therefore cuts a different path for the post-religious. Just as Scholem, however unwittingly, presents us with a Kabbalah without halakhah, so Benjamin quite wittingly addresses a theology without God. An intractable contradiction? Perhaps. Nevertheless, it is a historical conundrum that we have yet to overcome.</em></p>

				<p>I prefer posts that have a book under discussion. But since people have liked my past rambles, here are various things heard or observed since Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I had a junior high reunion. The person with whom I drove in talked about how the majority of the class was surprisingly still somewhat observant even through half the class went to public high. Attending a Day School for HS was not needed to keep people religious, rather other factors. She mentioned that in the late 1970’s there was great optimism in the new Modern Orthodox institutions. She commented how everyone thought whatever kinks in the day school system were going to be ironed out. No more 1960’s gruff rebbes without teaching skills letting out their frustration on the kids, now it was going to be American teachers paid well. So everyone rode the wave of optimism.  In contrast, she pointed out how now her husband is on the school board dealing with long term planning issues not dreamt of then. She also pointed out from her own observations and those of her kids that right now many HS kids are going through periods to see what life is like without Orthodoxy, even the good and committed kids. Some of them go without shabbos and kashrus for a while, some a complete rumspringa, and others a mild thought experiment.  I wonder how the HS students decide in the end: cost-benefit analysis, where their interests lie, if they have the skills to make it on the outside, group think with friends, finding reaffirmation of meaning.</p>
<p>I wonder what kept everyone in the fold, it seems the optimism and Orthodoxy as a growth stock counted more than the formal content of a yeshiva high education. Most of them were what I called in an earlier post <a href="../../2010/11/16/golden-rule-jews-or-family-value-orthodoxy/index.html">Golden Rule Believers,</a> oblivious to ideology and textuality. They also broke down into those who stayed in NY, who even if they were non-observant, were nominally Conservative, or Conservidox, and still in the loop of observant culture from friends, neighbors, and business contacts. And one who came in from out of state were acculturated out of the former world and into new ways. Those completely off and out of the system did not attend.  </p>
<p>For my trend watching, I wonder what parts of the community are most optimistic now? Which parts think that they are just around the corner from perfection? What do twenty somethings feel most confident about Orthodoxy or which group of twenty-somethings are the most optimistic about solving everything. I am not asking which are most committed or most learned or most scared of the outside. Which group  between 18-28 sees itself as most on the right track in their decision? If you can identify it then you can pretty much be assured that they will last as Orthodox the course of their lives.</p>
<p>I meet a 30-31 year old couple who are renting a house here in Teaneck. They knew me and complained that it is not spiritual or intellectual. They know that if they stay here by buying a house, their lives will be rightly order and both will structure their lives to have material success and receive promotions. Their kids will have friends and possessions. But is that all there is? Where can they find an intellectual and spiritual neighborhood in the US?</p>
<p>Met a thirty year old who used to briefly blog about his pain at ethical scandals in the Orthodox community. No longer blogs and has given up all observance entirely. Finds all these big Centrist derashot that combine Bible as literature, Rav Soloveitchik Torah and presentism as hokey and as having nothing to do with the Bible. It is interesting that Orthodoxy was presented to him as these new Literary Biblical derashot and not as an “halakhic system.”</p>
<p>Met a person who claims his son says that his class is 40% not observant and 20% non-observant and also lechahis. Even I think this number of 60 % is a great overstatement but what is interesting is that only a third are lechahis against the system. When you meet the older baby boomers who left Orthodoxy are now 58-65 , you get much more anger and lechahis reaction.  I get a sense that it is due to socio-economic reasons. Most of those who were so angry grew up in inner-city Orthodoxy and saw Orthodoxy of the 1940’s and 1950’s as backwards, poor, uneducated and primitive. I get a sense that now if your Orthodoxy is upper-middle class and consists of malls, suburbia, and entertainment then one cannot be so angry. I may be wrong, we will know after the fact but I sense that for the majority this is a respectful checking out without the need for anger. Even now, I have colleagues in the English department in their 60’s who still picture the Orthodoxy of their youth and cannot imagine anything positive in Orthodoxy let alone the existence of an Orthodox academic. They are still angry after 50 years.</p>
<p>Was told at a Shabbat meal by a parent of a Maaleh Gilboa student that YU made a pitch to attract Maaleh Gilboa students. AT the meeting, they had to admit that the graduates of Maaleh Gilboa wont find any of the YU Roshei Yeshiva to their liking and that the latter will oppose and condemn what they think as Maaleh Gilboa grads, but they should come anyway and take solace in philosophy and Jewish studies. More interestingly, the pitch turned into a single focus on how they are not ready to be in a co-ed environment. A very senior YU person said: “What if it is New Year’s Eve and a non-Jewish girl sits on your lap with a bottle of non-kosher champagne and says lets have some fun? You are not mature enough to handle it. You are not mature enough to make the right decisions. Only when you reach graduate school will you be ready to be in a co-ed environment.” The YU person said it actually happened to him when he went to NYU, now he sees he made the wrong choice. The fear of the outside became the major part of the pitch. I was not there and this is hearsay but the students asked about the ban at YU of Rabbi Ethan Tucker, a graduate of Maaleh Gilboa. More tellingly, they asked about Levinas and the importance of doubt, disbelief, and mature faith, and were only met with lack of comprehension of their points- submission counts not doubt.  The most important point was rather than using anything aspirational or ideological they offered  fear that a girl will sit on your lap and fear that you will give up Torah, mizvos, and learning if you go to a secular college. </p>
<p>It is a known Yeshivish thing to point out that Chanuka had no holiday sacrifice, no hagigah so one should not say Hag Sameah. I received Christmas cards from Hebrew speaking Christians that say Hag Ha-Molad Sameach  and Hag Sameach for Hag-Hamolad. Should they be corrected?<br />
I received Holiday Cards for New Year’s from Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, and India and noticed that they waited until after Christmas in order not to have to mention it and to only mention New Years.   </p>

				<p>&#8220;Distance yourself from a false word,&#8221; (Exodus 23:7) &#8220;A man shall not lie to his friend.&#8221; (Lev. 19:11)</p>
<p>For the last two years, I have been forwarded by many people a complete fabrication by a frum website that generally circulates BS and falsehood without any leg to stand on.</p>
<p>The deceitful website says:</p>
<p><em>“Sylvester,” was the name of the “Saint” and Roman Pope who reigned during the Council of Nicaea (325 C.E.). The year before the Council of Nicaea convened, Sylvester convinced Constantine to prohibit Jews from living in Jerusalem. At the Council of Nicaea, Sylvester arranged for the passage of a host of viciously anti-Semitic legislation. All Catholic “Saints” are awarded a day on which Christians celebrate and pay tribute to that Saint’s memory. December 31 is Saint Sylvester Day – hence celebrations on the night of December 31 are dedicated to Sylvester’s memory.</em></p>
<p>I dont know where to begin. Sylvester was too ill to attend the Council of Nicaea. No, he did not convince Constantine to ban Jews from Jerusalem. Nicaea was not about anti-Jewish statements- it was when the Church changes their calendar so that Easter did not have to be calculated by means of contact with Jews to find out when they were celebrating Passover. Here are <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nicea1.txt">the decrees of Nicaea.</a></p>
<p>There are no records to prove his created anti-Jewish legislation and no historian claims it. For the little we know see James Parkes, <em>The Conflict of Church and Synagogue </em>page 186<br />
For the up to date bibliography,see Paula Fredriksen &amp; Oded Irshai,<a href="http://www.bu.edu/religion/files/pdf/Christianity-and-Anti-Judaism-in-Late-Antiquity-Polemics-and-Policies-from-the-Second-to-the-Seventh-Centuries.pdf"> Christianity and Anti-Judaism in Late Antiquity Polemics and Policies, from the Second to the Seventh Centuries.</a> The anti-Jewish decrees were by Constantine. As far as we know, Sylvester did not convince him of anything and power was vested in Emperor.</p>
<p>There is a medieval &#8220;Forged Canons of Nicaea&#8221; where in some versions Sylvester is credited with decreeing that Jews and Christians should not share bread or eat together. <a href="http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/seaver/text.html">For a version that does not attribute it to him.</a><br />
That decree was also not by Sylvester and actually suggested by the very anti-Jewish John Chrysostom and not made legislation until the 7th century and widespread in the middle ages. On this topic, see David M. Freidenreich, <a href="http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=david_freidenreich">Sharing Meals with Non-Christians in Canon Law Commentaries, Circa 1160-1260: A Case Study in Legal Development</a> It is similar to the ways that Second Temple and Talmudic law does not allow Jews to eat food prepared by gentiles or to eat their wine, cheese, bread et al, or to eat with them.</p>
<p><strong>We had enough real and deadly Anti-Jewish legislation and rabid hatred of Judaism without making things up.</strong></p>
<p>For more Forgeries about Sylvester, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmachean_forgeries">Silvestri constitutum</a> which do include a story of his contact with a Jewish sorcerer.<br />
In the medieval Christan <a href="http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden145.htm">The Golden Legend,</a> a book of medieval tales- the source of many Ashkenaz Jewish tales- there are legend of how Sylvester slays a dragon and staged a public medieval style disputation with Jews.</p>
<p>The origins of the January 1st festivities go back to the Roman era. Sylvester and Constantine, still living in a pagan world, would have condemned the celebration as a pagan practice. It only became part of the West later when the original Roman practices were lost. Since the celebration of St Sylvester day was done in a morning mass it had little to do with the midnight celebration. A mass offered at midnight would already have been for the next day, the St. Basil day. Calling the evening festivities by the name of Sylvester was widespread in Eastern Europe. When and why Eastern European counties started calling the evening festivities by the name of the Saint and was it based on a medieval Italian locution is beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>
<p>The false frum blog also has false stories of Julius Ceaser, which I did not bother to refute.</p>
<p>The frum website is also responsible for circulating the completely incorrect statistics predicting Haredim to multiply with simple geometric growth like Drosophila and liberal Jews to cease to be. Those statistics are entirely false and not based on anything actuarial or use of any valid method. I wish a frum actuary or statistician would just post the refutation already. I am not the statistician to do it.</p>
<p>There needs to be a Jewish Snopes just for that website. Last year, when I first received the Sylvester story, I goggled to see if there was any immediate source to forward people. Instead, I found people trying to rewite wiki and online Roman histories using this false source as a valid source.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I am a big Robert Wuthnow fan for his analysis of the American ethos and American religion.  He and his team of researchers keep putting out great books. Today, whether you call it fortuitous or providential, I received an email announcement that Robert Wuthnow will release his new book on the Midwest in Jan 2011. The book is on the general ethos, he will probably issue a book on the religion of Midwest in 2012. So, after giving “AS” a chance to view the Midwest as declining compared to the East and allowing others to offer a personal nostalgic look, let us turn to the data and use that to try and analyze where Midwest Jewry is going</p>
<p>The book is called <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9296.html">Remaking the Heartland: Middle America since the 1950s</a>. As in many of his other books, he starts with the 1950’s and 60’s and then gives the changes of the 1980-2010. Most people and most textbooks still view social change as forever wedded to the issues of the 1950’s. </p>
<p>His current work shows that people have stereotypes of the Midwest and people need to stop looking at the decline in farming and rust belt industries. Now it is booming due to avionics, fiber-optic communications, finance, medical technology, and bioscience. There are new suburbs. And new meat packing towns made up of immigrants</p>
<p>What does this mean for Judaism? First, whoever gets to the new suburbs with new congregations wins. Most of the Orthodox neighborhoods are not in the new suburbs and exurbs. This is also true about the data from the Census. Open your synagogues in the new carpet-bagger suburbs in Texas of transplanted Northerners and over time they will fill up to capacity.  (Who will win by opening first:Chabad? Aish Hatorah? Reform? Renewal? Lakewood Kolel?)</p>
<p>Second, the fields of avionics, fiber-optic communications, medical technology, and bioscience are not emphasized back East. I do not think a researcher in fiber-optics will in any way feel inferior to the lawyer or radiologist of the East Coast.  The East coast may need to lose it pride. But the image of midwest Jewish shop keeper is over. </p>
<p>Third, Wuthnow’s point about the complexity of the meat-packing towns was shown in the Potsville case. The Orthodox Jews who move out there to supply the ever increasing need for kosher meat will not be the same sort as those interested in bioscience and they wont live in the same towns.</p>
<p>So does this data change anyone’s comments on Centrism in the Midwest? What narrative would you create for this vision of the midwest? Are doctors who come for the medical schools leaving because they want Torah or because they want kosher restaurants? </p>
<p>One things is certain: The same way Centrism created doctors in Teaneck who drink dry wine and ignored the small towns and elderly shop keepers of the North East and Bronx, the new narrative will be entirely about those in the new suburbs of fiber–optics and medical research and it will ignore Detroit, Cleveland, and all the Jewish shop keepers. Does this effect anyone’s comments about the Midwest?</p>
<p>Several of the commenters mentioned that the community was not divided in clear denominations when they were growing up, Can anyone remember the moments that created the labeling? Which Rabbis? Which events? Who tore it apart and in what year?</p>
<p><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i9296.pdf">From the introductory chapter</a>  of Wuthnow’s Remaking the Heartland: Middle America since the 1950s</p>
<blockquote><p>During the half century that began in the 1950s, the American Middle West— Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Arkansas, and Oklahoma—underwent a dramatic social transformation. The region’s population grew at only half the national rate. More than three thousand towns declined. Agriculture suffered from adverse weather and wild market fluctuations in the 1950s, experienced worse conditions in the 1980s, and became far less significant to the region’s economy.<br />
But the heartland was far different in the early twenty-first century than predictions of its demise had suggested. </p>
<p>Stereotypes of a benighted hinterland had been replaced by images of hospitality and ingenuity. The region’s elementary and secondary schools were among the best in the nation. Its commitment to public higher education consistently ranked high. Without any of the nation’s largest cities, the region was known for innovative medical research and bioscience technology. It hosted some of the nation’s largest businesses and had become a magnet for sprawling exurban commercial districts and housing developments.</p>
<p>Retailers in small towns lost business to franchise outlets in regional centers.</p>
<p>Surely the region was remaking itself, they argued, by importing cheap labor to work in conditions reminiscent of The Jungle and with ethnic tensions as the expected result. But the restructuring of agribusiness proved to be a more complicated story.</p>
<p>Edge cities were not expected to emerge in the Middle West to the extent they did in the Sunbelt and on both coasts, but they did appear and increasingly became symbolic of the Middle West’s new role in the national economy. By 2005 there were ninety-five independently incorporated edge cities with at least ten thousand residents within twenty miles of the region’s eight largest cities. More people lived in these suburbs than in those large cities combined.</p>
<p>Those employers were the principal architects of the region’s new emphasis on avionics, fiber-optic communications, finance, medical technology, and bioscience.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>These past few weeks there has been a little drama being played out that may effect religious texts on the web and Orthodox Judaism. </p>
<p>In Nov 2009 a group of conservative Catholics intellectuals and clergy issued the <a href="http:///www.manhattandeclaration.org/home.aspx">Manhattan Declaration</a> on the nature of marriage.<br />
It was designed to serve as an ideological and philosophic document for conservative Church reform and education. While acknowledging that &#8220;Christians and our institutions have too often scandalously failed to uphold the institution of marriage,&#8221; the group rejects same-sex marriage. The declaration states that opening a legal door for gay marriage would do the same for &#8220;polyamorous partnerships, polygamous households, even adult brothers, sisters, or brothers and sisters living in incestuous relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple has rejected twice an application to produce an APP for the document since they consider it harmful and hate speech toward same-sex marriage. Will this now cause a ripple for other apps? Would an APP for YUTorah be allowed if they know what if there? How about responsa or Rabbinic literature? There is plenty in contemporary rabbinic literature that would be just as against diversity and accepting the other.  If this goes to court, there will be plenty of Amicus Curiae Briefs and could set the lines for relgion and the internet. Thoughts from a Jewish perspective?</p>
<blockquote><p> Apple Says &#8220;No&#8221; to Manhattan Declaration App 2.0<br />
December 23, 2010<br />
We received notice from Apple last evening regarding their rejection of our resubmission of the Manhattan Declaration iPhone/iPad app to the Apple App Store. This is an appalling response from Apple.  Nearly 500,000 Christians have signed the Manhattan Declaration including representatives from many major Protestant denominations, leading Catholic Bishops and leaders of the Orthodox Church.  </p>
<p>Apple is telling us that the apps&#8217; content is considered &#8220;likely to expose a group to harm&#8221; and &#8220;to be objectionable and potentially harmful to others.&#8221; Inasmuch as the Manhattan Declaration simply reaffirms the moral teachings of our Christian faith on the sanctity of human life, marriage and sexual morality, and religious freedom and the rights of conscience, Apple&#8217;s statement amounts to the charge that our faith is &#8220;potentially harmful to others.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
