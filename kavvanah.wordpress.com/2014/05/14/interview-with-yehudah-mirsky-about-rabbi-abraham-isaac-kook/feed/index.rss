					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes it feels to me that the world of orthodoxy between the wars was somewhat different than we might imagine. I think of my grandfather, after who I am named, who made aliyah in the 30&#039;s with my father and aunt. He returned because of a bad heart before the war. He was a rabbi, born in Poland and sent my father to Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin. 

My point is that I have two photos of him - one on the beach with my uncle, and between them is standing Meir Dizengoff. The other picture, he is standing next to Rav Kook at a Degel Yerushalayim rally. While I admire him, I do not think that he was necessarily unique. In that context perhaps Rav Kook was the voice of a generation in some ways, and not sui generis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great  interview. My thanks to both Alan and Yehudah. As someone who has studied the writings  of Rav Kook and who has written a number of articles about him, the main new perspective I gleaned from the biography is that Rav Kook&#039;s becoming Chief Rabbi was an almost unmitigated disaster for him and for the Office of the Chief Rabbinate,  for reasons which Yehudah spells out very nicely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“It’s fair to say he would have appreciated a lot about Modern Orthodoxy – and yet, it does seem to this observer at least, in its deeply bourgeois character, its tamping down of subjectivity, expression, in its not seeing inner freedom as a religious value, to be well afield of what he had in mind. He wanted the religious life, in a deep way, to be wild.”

In what way does MO tamp down subjectivity and expression more than Hareidi Orthodoxy? How does the latter embrace “inner freedom” and being “wild” as religious values? How are any these compatible with Orthodox dogma?]]></description>
