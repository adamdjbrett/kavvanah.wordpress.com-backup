					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t make too much of this. AP is talking of its need to serve local papers -- and local newspapers are a dying breed, both because their non-local news is a commodity and because of the collapse of retail advertising. Newspapers are becoming more like television news, but the audience of both are increasingly the elderly. Those who want interesting news on any topic can find it. Those who don&#039;t probably weren&#039;t reading it anyways.

Personally,  I&#039;m somewhat less informed about global political developments than I was in the days when I relied on the editors of the New York Times to be the gatekeepers of my news -- but to be honest, given that I had to triage my NYT reading to get any work done at all, I tended to skip many of the world stories after glancing at the headlines. I am, however, better informed on several topics now that I&#039;m getting the information straight from blogs and more technical news services.]]></description>

The tendency to speak in echo chambers started not with the internet but with automobiles, suburbs and mobility (see Bill Bishop&#039;s &quot;The Big Sort&quot;).  Internet sound-bit-ification makes it worse.  

Just to demonstrate how difficult this problem is:  Bishop&#039;s depressing book, published in early 2008, ends on a hopeful note that in the first decade of the 21st century, many people were looking for unifying forces that would bring disagreeing citizens to common cause.  He cites, as an example of a unifying force, the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama.]]></description>

I completely agree. Law Prof and former Obama official Cass Sunstein wrote about this more than a decade ago. I was skeptical of his thesis at the time, but it has turned out to be prescient. I think many in the society, other than Internet trolls, are losing both the habit and the inclination to engage with those with whom they disagree on fundamental matters, and what engagement does take place  is less and less civil or mutually respectful. I wish I had a better answer for these phenomena; perhaps some carefully curated websites dedicated to serious, respectful interchange will emerge, but I suspect these will serve a small minority.]]></description>

But if everyone reads blogs then we have the problem that everyone is in a silo or echo chamber. There is less public discourse or a public society. Crimes and abuse are not hidden anymore; that is good. However, deeper questions do not have a public forum outside echo chambers and FB sound bits are not sufficient.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are dumbing down throughout our society. Even the media that general interest readers looked to for greater depth are following this trend. It is, so to say, dispiriting in the extreme, particularly but not only in the spiritual/ religious domain.

Fortunately, the net with its blogs, such as yours, provides the possibility for those intrepid and determined enough to seek them out.

Keep them coming.]]></description>
