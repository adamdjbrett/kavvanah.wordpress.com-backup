					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve met people who do it the opposite way -- try to impose modern, yogic limitations on the characters in the Bhagvad Gita, for example.  Or that the incredible Ayurvedic understanding of anatomy was all done by learning about the body externally and reading energy flows.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shai and Mara- People wonder about what the iron age artifacts says about the Bible and sometimes they then try to suppress the thought. But they do not argue that it is 21st century Judaism. 

I have spoken to various Westerners- students in the hall of the religion department, people on line at the exhibitions in NY, blog commentors, westerners at sites in India and even professors in other fields. They inevitably conflate 200CE to 2014 CE. 

I had a museum with artifacts of the Ganga valley from 200-1600 across from my office, Diana Eck writes in her book that we have no idea what many of them originally meant. I could just listen to the comments of the visitors explaining them in modern terms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post.  I wasn&#039;t aware that people regard statuary and artifacts from the earliest times in India as representative of current Hindu thought.  As you say, the word Hinduism was not yet invented.  

Are you saying this is standard fare among religious Jews or professors of Jewish studies?  

If they do, it&#039;s most likely from the paucity of their knowledge surrounding these issues, just as the similar case would be of someone with little knowledge of Judaism making assumptions about various artifacts from Israel over the millennia.  

I haven&#039;t been keeping up with museum exhibits clearly, so thanks for the various tip offs.  I&#039;ll make a point to go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating observations and questions! I am nevertheless unconvinced by your final, critical contrast between the relationship between Judaism and the ISAW artifacts, and the relationship between the Vedas and Hinduism. Let me ask it this way: Don&#039;t you think that people who see the incredible IRON age artifacts at the renewed Israel Museum legitimately wonder about the connections with Judaism? This is mainly because the ancient corpus we know as the Bible was formed then and still remains sacred to Judaism. Couldn&#039;t the same be said (even if to lesser extent) of the Vedas?]]></description>
