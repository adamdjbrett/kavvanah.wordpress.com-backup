					<description><![CDATA[i think this is not only a powerful topic, valuable that KJ and R. Lookstein have given it a public airing and important to name the phenomena (as naming gives power and identity)- i think Social Orthodoxy (SO) fits nicely. One could also go with Orthoprax, to be a bit of a word nerd. But ultimately, based on R. Lookstein&#039;s own description, these are basically very frum Reconstructionist Jews. Their ideology is essentially the same, but their practice (or praxis) is more inline with Orthodox halacha, which seems like a sensible alternative to normative Reconstructionism.

What surprises me about many of these comments is the upset or rejection around SO practice. As if belief is something that can be properly or effectively &#039;taught&quot;, or that any faith group in history has ever figured out how to do consistently. Or, more to the point, as if Judaism itself doesnt prize action over belief (mi lo lishma bah lishma). What would these commentators have SOs do? Stop practicing halachic Judaism? I dont see another viable option that would satisfy the dilemma or tension for the commenters. It&#039;s certainly not practical/possible to try the only other alternative for resolution, namely to somehow make SOs believe in God or the divine as a source of mitzvot. So what seems to be more the issue is that SOs are now forming a public identity, making themselves known rather than hiding. They have no doubt existed since the beginning of Judaism. I can understand the tension or discomfort their identity creates for normative, faith-based Orthodox Jews but that tension is theirs to bear, not a reflection or critique of SOs.]]></description>

&quot;observing the commandments&quot; in many circumstances requires someone to recite a Birkas HaMitzvah that acknowledges&quot; HaShem Elokeinu Melech HaOlam Asher Kidshanu Bmitzvosav&quot; -if someone lacks emunah why go through what is to him or her is nothing more than &quot;doing Shabbos&quot; and the like? How can you expect to transmit Torah to thye next generation with such a perspective?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grant that Rabbi Lookstein did not address the issues of God, theology or broader haskafa views. 
But to say that one cannot pray without a firm assent to a halakhic defined God is the sort of answer one finds in FB debates- neither empirical or philosophically true about prayer. It may be Brisker true but that is another matter. Rav Soloveitchik however was clear in several essays about acknowledging the universal human quest for the transcendent.
And to just say that one need emunah shelamah to be frum, I could have gotten from Rav Elhanan Wasserman. 
I assume that the recording had a better analysis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Professor Brill,
Thank you for your interest.  Rav Rosensweig spends the first several minutes discussing how foundational belief is a basic part of Judaism. Quoting from Rambam in pirush hamishnayot and other well known sources.  That so called social orthodoxy exists and has been described is one thing.  But it is so obviously contrary to torah Judaism. And it is very troubling that Rabbi Lookstein does not point out the many gaping holes in such a &#039;jewish lifestyle&#039;  If one gets up in the morning and &#039;davens&#039; but doesn&#039;t believe who he is praying to, then what is that person doing?!
I am afraid that I don&#039;t have the  time to give a full outline of his talk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems to many commenters that the highest value in a stream of Jewish tradition is its ability to self-perpetuate through the generations.   If so, I think Rabbi Lookstein is pointing out that “Social Orthodoxy” (SO, for the sake of abbreviation) may not be failing.  His congregant is SO, and apparently the congregant’s children are SO too.

Certainly that’s an anecdote.  But it raises the possibility of a test.  What elements of a religious stream actually work most effectively to self-perpetuate the religion?   Belief alone?  Practice alone?  Fervent practice with, or without belief?   

I remember hearing about a mitnagged rabbi whose son left Orthodox practice.  He explained his failure that “we didn’t sing zemiros on shabbes.”  And I know many believing, non-practicing Jews whose children and grandchildren have little Judaism at all.  

I wonder whether social scientists have gathered data on people in Jewish or other religious traditions that might illuminate which of these elements (belief, practice, fervor) best engender self-perpetuation, and what environments tend to encourage the optimal combinations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Lookstein&#039;s answer is correct:Social Orthodoxy is dysfunctional in terms of its inability to transmit commitment to another generation. Consider the death of Yiddishism in America (see Samuel G. Freedman&#039;s Jew Vs. Jew) Ahad Ha-Am&#039;s daughter inter-married, Herzl&#039;s children were not Zionists, Ben Gurion&#039;s son intermarried, - Mendelssohn&#039;s children converted (except for one son) all Jewish ideologies  not rooted in a belief in God,  disappeared- Sholom Aleichem&#039;s childen were Russian speaking (not Yiddish) speaking etc. &quot;Zionism&quot; among Israel&#039;s left is a derogatory term. But the most  significant proof is in the dramatic decline of &quot;Social Judaism&quot; e.g. Conservative and Reform in the United States. Modern Orthodoxy despite its &quot;sociability&quot; is still rooted in a Divine source -prayer and mitzvoth -and is the only Jewish ideology to be effective after one generation. (

					<description><![CDATA[Belief is a very individual thing. So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really correct to think of multiple generations of Social Orthodox Jews, or of Social Orthodox communities. In any given family, or community, there are often going to be people who are observant but don&#039;t believe (or who aren&#039;t sure if they believe). If they keep their doubts to themselves (and perhaps even work on improving their faith through reading and prayer and conversation with those with more emuna), rather than trying to spread their disbelief, and raise their children in Orthodox schools and teach their children the importance of remaining observant, then they won&#039;t negatively impact their children and the wider community. 

However, one implication of social orthodoxy is that it teaches us that when we are convincing people to stay or become Orthodox, it may be a bad idea to focus too much or exclusively on belief. If we instead emphasize the fact that only Orthodoxy (which is after all the only real continuation of traditional Judaism) has been able to inspire even a minimal level of Jewish knowledge and commitment (marrying Jewish, raising kids to be observant), and the benefits of having a tight-knit neighborhood-based Jewish community (which only Orthodoxy provides), that may be more effective. 

On the other hand, Social Orthodoxy may teach us the opposite -- that we should try different ways of strengthening people&#039;s belief. How many Shabbos morning drashas are focused on trying to explain *why* we should believe?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m always skeptical of Orthodox Jews who say &quot;if I didn&#039;t believe the Torah was divine I wouldn&#039;t bother.&quot; I know plenty of Orthodox Jews who don&#039;t believe that the Torah is divine, but still observe the mitzvot.  The Pew Report said that 19% of MO Jews don&#039;t are unsure of God&#039;s existence and 3% are outright deniers. Why are they still identifying with MO? Also, think of the theologies of Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Howard Wettstein, Norman Solomon, Avi Sagi, and Tamar Ross. These people expend a lot of energy justifying Halachah in the absence of the conventional idea of divine origin. 
 
I think it has to do with cognitive dissonance. Orthodoxy is a huge commitment. If suddenly you realize you don&#039;t believe its central tenets, it is often easier to buy into something like the value of &quot;Jewish people-hood&quot; or
develop some system in which Halachah has value despite its human origins. It is easier to adjust your beliefs, to find a new way of rationalizing what you are doing, than it is to change your practices. 

This is a side point, but when I think of &quot;Social Orthodoxy,&quot; I don&#039;t think of the description that Jay Lefkowitz gives. That seems more like a conservative Mordecai Kaplan. I think there is also a segment of Orthodoxy (I know it exists,but don&#039;t have numbers on its extent) that affiliates with Orthodoxy for primarily social reasons. Its members might invoke &quot;Jewish People-hood&quot; if you push them, but it is more of a rationalization of their practice then an actual explanation of its motivation. They stay Orthodox (though maybe not strictly observant) because their family and friends are all Orthodox. Because they understand the Modern Orthodox world, having grown up in its comfortably bourgeois bosom. For them, it is simply more comfortable to stay and any ideological justifications are redundant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I expected that the counter would be laden with Halakhic intertextualism which so permeates (respectable) Orthodox Rabbinic literature. But, unfortunately, I am disappointed. There are numerous Halakhic, Hashkafic, and philosophic counters to Jay&#039;s essay; but none are contained in this article. This article merely transforms Jay&#039;s statements into questions: &quot;That troubling question remains. On the answer to it depends the survival and sustainability of a sanctified Jewish way of life, a life in which Jay Lefkowitz and all of us so passionately believe.&quot;  I hope readers know to look elsewhere for a good, reasoned rebuttal.]]></description>
