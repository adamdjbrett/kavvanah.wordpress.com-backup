					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2014/05/09/adin-steinsaltz-my-rebbe/#comment-10554&quot;&gt;HS&lt;/a&gt;.

If it does have any factual basis one would not get it from this book which does not worry about getting any details right. For example, in the prior paragraph it puts Heschel in Berlin at the same time as the Rebbe. His story selection was to paint a universal image. 
There is a great need for many to connect the Rav and the Rebbe, the message of the story is the need of the readers.
Rav Soloveitchik would not have called it Humboldt University since it was only University of Berlin at the time. The Rav and Heschel continued to call it Berlin decades later. There were also many other Jews in Berlin and the Rebbe had his circle of connections. The Rav is probably the last person you would call to post bail, especially as foreign citizen. One would have to check details but one would likely have been deported after such an event.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I related to  some acquaintances in the Lubavitch movement the story above concerning Rabbis Soloveitchik and Schneerson in Berlin on Purim.  As I began to describe it, one interrupted me and finished it almost exactly as Rabbi Steinsaltz describes it above.  And he described the lineage of the story, naming the person X he had heard it from, who had heard it from Y, who had heard it from Rabbi Soloveitchik (3rd hand, in summary).  

It sounded ridiculous to me too.  But perhaps it has some basis in fact.]]></description>
