					<description><![CDATA[[site owner- I include this comment which does not follow ordinary comment guidelines as a clear illustrative response to HS, to show that nothing on my blog will change the rabbinical perceptions. I did not let it through to debate the Meiri or Ibn Ezra. It does show how even Rishonim with inconvenient opinions are trash talked by 19 year olds.]

He calls the location &quot;sacred&quot;? He confuses Hindu astrology with that of Ibn Ezra? This doesn&#039;t make him a very reliable source from a Torah point of view.

Further, it sounds like he fell for a line, in the same way that the Meiri fell for the line the Christians fed him about that they don&#039;t really worship Jesus as God.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is pretty compelling evidence that the hair gathered in tonsuring should not be considered an “idolatrous offering,” and therefore Jewish wig-wearers should feel comfortable using wigs built with such hair.  

I’m sure there are many readers of this blog who would be in a position to present that opinion to people in influencing authority.  And I am also confident that the people who distribute wig-hair from Tirumala to Jewish wig-makers would find very strong reason to hold onto this evidence to support  their commercial enterprises.

That being said, most of the people who hold influence on the matter of “what’s a kosher sheitel” don’t know the difference between Tirumala and Tiramisu.  So I suspect that the prejudice against such hair will pervade for generations to come.  

It would be interesting to come back in a few years and use this as a case study to see whether reality can play a role in determining an halachic norm.]]></description>
