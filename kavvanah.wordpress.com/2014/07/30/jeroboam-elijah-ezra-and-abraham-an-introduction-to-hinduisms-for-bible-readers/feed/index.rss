					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this very much.  One thing that my Hindu friends seem to have in common is a strong belief that holiness and divinity are found all around us.   This is evidenced in India by Hindus who leave offerings at churches and even (I have heard) at synagogues.  If a place is known to be holy to some group, if prayers are said there and people go there to try to reach the Divine, that&#039;s good enough.  Leave a few flowers or some fruit to show respect to that path.  They are curious and open to other religions without feeling challenged by them.  They don&#039;t understand the need to limit access to G-d to one path, nor the need to have one true story.  As a liberal, it&#039;s very hard for me to find fault with this way of thinking.  Obviously, this is one area where my understanding of G-d and Judaism&#039;s understanding of G-d are at odds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your historical reconstruction misses one thing. If Judiam had become what you described, and had there be no uncompromisimg and untainted monotheistic ideal, would the various and sundry syncretic religions move toward the monotheistic goal, or would the remaining scribes and priests become themselves mongrelized.  Hinduism moved toward monotheistic veneer because of the pull and prestige of Christianity and Islam. It would not have done so in the kind of harmonious and ultimately empty syncretic world that you described.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remind my readers to review the rules for comments. Knowledge of Indian religion from google, or ignorance, or kiruv literature does not get posted.
No comments from Hindu nationalists about genocidal meat-eating monotheists or anything similar will be posted. Limit comments to the local issue of this post.
There was no offense intended toward Hinduism or the Bible.]]></description>
