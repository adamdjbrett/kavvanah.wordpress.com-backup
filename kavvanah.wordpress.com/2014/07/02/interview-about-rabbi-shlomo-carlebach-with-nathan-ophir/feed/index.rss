					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Ophir:  

I have no direct information concerning the sexual habits of Rabbi Carlebach.  I do, however, have experience with other such prominent, abusive rabbis, and with the organizational and personal habits that pervaded the Western world before the 21st century, and allowed such leaders to act with impunity.  These men share a broad pattern of personal behavior in public, personal behavior in private, and follower behavior that protected them.  Rabbi Carlebach fits that pattern.  

The science of investigating sexual abuse has also advanced significantly since its infancy in the 1970s, when anything short of penetration wasn&#039;t considered abuse.  It is now well documented that rape and sexual abuse are both grossly under-reported.  It is also well accepted now that malicious, false reports are rare.    It is further accepted that multiple malicious, false reports about the same person are exceedingly rare.  

In a nutshell:  where there’s smoke, there’s fire.  So I am not surprised to see a response like Len’s, that  your decision not to address the abuse allegations feels like a whitewash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; It did not justify Len’s harsh conclusion that there was a willingness or intent to commit adultery.

It seems to me that you misunderstood my statement.

By any measure  R. Carlebach overstepped the bounds of propriety in his relationships with women.

He was oblivious to boundaries and evidently didn’t - at least sometimes - consider the marital status of the women he called.

He didn’t have to be sexually explicit or have actual physical contact to 
have crossed a line into impropriety. “Cold calling” a woman he barely knows to come meet him alone in the middle of the night is unquestionably improper, regardless of her marital status.

It would be hard to imagine anyone not being appalled at the idea of an 
aging rock star, much less a rabbi, calling their 16-year-old 
daughter and pleading with her to come be alone with him.

I&#039;m quite amazed at your resistance to acknowledge what he did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1.	I interviewed this morning the woman mentioned by Len. Her personal story concerns a phone call she received from the San Francisco airport at a late hour. It did not justify Len’s harsh conclusion that there was a willingness or intent to commit adultery. 
2.	David, if you have a contact for a documented story of “sexual abuse” and not just another anonymous rumor, please send it to me. 
3.	HS – I wonder about the severity of your language. If you have any direct information could you please write to me directly at CarlebachBook@gmail.com. 
4.	The sexual sins of Reuven, King David, King Solomon, and the sons of Eli, were all made public knowledge in the Bible. Yet, in Shabbat 55b-56b, R. Shmuel bar Nachmani in the name of R. Yonatan states – anyone who thinks that they really sinned sexually is mistaken. Good thing there was no Internet then because one dreads to imagine what blogger commentators would have done to tarnish the memories of these great leaders.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From my perspective, Rabbi Carlebach is hardly unusual in being a charismatic, creative religious leader who abused his power by taking sexual advantage of his cult-like followers.  And this is hardly a Jewish-only phenomenon.

Rabbi Carlebach and people like him bring great benefits to the world, but they cause estimable damage as well.  We (and our educational instutitions in particular) need to understand better how the charisma and creativity relate to the abusive tendencies, and how to make sure that the next generation of leaders preserves their charisma and creativity while preserving bounds of propriety.  

Frank discussion of Carlebach, both his public life and his private failures, would help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Somehow we need to integrate the idealized picture we have of Reb Shlomo Carlbach with the pathetic realities that dominated his private life. As long as the two are seen as separate, we cannot arrive at a full appreciation of his strengths and limits as a religious leader. Briefly, the central personality trait that limited his greatness was his inability to make real contact with others and maintain a relationship over time. He used his charisma and charm to manipulate people, not only women but all he met. This failure  had as a necessary consequence that  he could never establish a long lasting mass movement. Many rebbes are charismatic, grandiose, demand attention and acknowledgement, but at their best they offer much in return. They still can look at people empathically and give advice and blessings that benefit their followers. So it’s not the pathological narcissism as such that limits the greatness of a charismatic rebbe, as much as an inability  to provide real benefits for those who are attracted to his larger than life personality. If he is here today and gone tomorrow the relationships and community  fall apart quickly.  

Rabbi Zalman Schecter z’l passed away this past week  at age 89. He did have some understanding how narcissistic traits limit the effect of a charismatic leader. He wrote at length  how a rebbe deals with the chasid’s  transference, and the inevitable counter transference.  In his case it is difficult to arrive at any assessment of his success because his goals and ideals kept on changing, unlike Carlebach who stayed much closer to normative Judaism and its traditional spiritual goals.  Whatever their faults, both did manage to make something important out of their lives with the forces and capacities that were available to them. Despite their very human limitations they were major influences on the Jewish life of their generation.  

This week also was the 20th yahrzeit of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, a genius when it came to understanding people, staying on message  and maintaining  a constant relationship with his followers. His piety, intelligence and  clarity of purpose put him  in a different league than his two most spirited and venturesome chassidim. And yet I wonder whether the messianic program that was dominant at the end of the Lubavitcher’s life was not in some way similar  to the need for recognition and affirmation that were so great an influence on both Reb Shlomo and Reb Zalman? Despite the four recent biographies of the Rebbe we are still nowhere close to understanding who he was.]]></description>

I have no doubts about what he did. To me they are not &quot;allegations&quot;(as if there&#039;s some doubt whether they are true or not). To me they are true.

					<description><![CDATA[It sounds like it is hard to ascertain weather these allegations are true or not and we may never know (not to negate the the importance of taking sexual abuse allegations seriously)  . Would it not be prudent to put that aside and focus on the positive message and what we can learn from R. Carlebach who had the unique ability   bring  tradition to  secular Jews in a non patronizing way ? Some great historical figures have made errors in their personal life but that does not negate the good they did nor what we can learn from them ? Did R. Carlebach have systematic approach to balance Halacha when it conflicted with outreach ?]]></description>

My sense is that you decided to not address this very dark and very important side of R. Carlebach&#039;s personality and life. It feels like a whitewash.

There are those who consider R. Carlebach to be on the level of a rebbe. Could anyone possibly accept as a rebbe someone who phoned married Jewish women in the middle of the night to convince them to come be with him?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here are the relevant paragraphs from the book. In two paragraphs Ophir cites the Lilith article, Awareness website, the Dickter article and a number of other newspaper articles. Then Ophir wrote that he interviewed the women from the Lilith article and concludes as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What really happened during Shlomo’s life? Did he misuse his charisma? Did he make mistakes in the ways that he hugged or related to women? And if so, should such stories be sought out and publicized?
Blustain&#039;s article in Lilith has been quoted so frequently that it has come to be thought of as an authoritative source. Indeed, Sarah Blustain, is an accomplished writer and worked for many years as an editor at Lilith. However, her stories about Reb Shlomo are difficult to verify because her sources and correspondence are filed away in archives labeled as “not available” for 50 years.1724

In trying to arrive at more definitive conclusions, I conducted long hours of in-depth interviews.1725 Many people who had been close to Shlomo over extended periods of time stated emphatically that the allegations are incorrect, reflect tabloid journalism, and it is immoral to assail a person not alive to defend himself.1726 But others were harsh in their criticism. They cited stories to prove that Shlomo acted wrongly and that some women were hurt emotionally. After listening carefully and examining the stories in an attempt to determine their veracity, eventually I decided to leave room for other writers to undertake the challenging tasks of judge or jury.1727 

What convinced me most was that the most prominent ethical message in Shlomo’s legacy is to refrain from caustic judgments. His motto was “You Never Know.” He illustrated time and again how external superficial actions can be misleading. Often Shlomo would declare how vital it was to reveal the goodness of the other person and to abstain from critical verdicts.1728&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

I base my information on interviews with quite a few people, including the women whose names are mentioned in the Internet  sources you cited, as well as several who were close to Reb Shlomo including some who actually dated him. If you think that I might have missed interviewing someone, please send me the name in a private email to CarlebachBook@gmail.com.]]></description>
