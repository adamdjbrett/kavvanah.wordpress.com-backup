					<description><![CDATA[How can Prof. Ross believe in both Orthodox Judaism as a cultural-linguistic construct and, at the same time, accept radical innovations in this cultural-linguistic construct.

Doesn&#039;t her position necessarily require the adoption of a very conservative approach to Halakha.

How could one have a form of Progressive Relevation (which changes the rules) if the Revelation and the community of the followers of this revelation is only defined by &quot;those who keep these rules&quot;?

1)	What is mysticism? 
This term is used, of course, in many contexts, to denote a variety of traditions and practices. The sense in which I use it here refers to a view which assumes the existence of an absolute, all-encompassing, monolithic and infinite unity (i.e., the Ein-sof) that transcends all particularist definitions and perceptions.

If no, then as a definition of mysticism it is meaningless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Add me to the list of people uncomfortable with Tamar Ross&#039;s approach. Not because I am uncomfortable with saying Torah has human elements to it, but because she basically removes the rudder from the ship and hopes the ship will be able to be steered in any way. 
She finds different traditional expressions to validate her views, that originally had nothing to do with what her conclusions are (70 faces to torah. The torah is not in heaven etc etc. )That to me is just being dishonest. 
In the end, Judaism to her is simply a matter of taste. As other people have noted, nothing stops anyone from dropping the whole enterprise and finding meaning within Shakespeare, or simply accept any other way of life as ongoing revelation. Her Judaism is simply a vague puff of smoke meant to give some sort of validation to keeping halacha. 
The irony in all this is, had she not been part of a wider group that keeps the orthodox way of life, would she continue to do so? The only way she can share this philosophy but still maintain the prax is because others around her are doing the &quot;dirty work&quot;, if you get my drift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that one fundamental question of Ross&#039;s theory has already been asked: if thought is just a way to justify practice, what&#039;s the point of practice? I would only add one thing. The statement of Lo BaShamayim Hi implies a clear distinction between shamayim and aretz. If earth and heaven all exist in one continuum, if all words of Torah are all some divine revelation (I think that&#039;s what she said) then I think that story would read likes this: 
Rabbi Eliezer says: &quot;if I&#039;m right God will tell you so!&#039; Rabbi Yehoshua responds: &quot;The Torah is no longer with God therefore that form of divine revelation is inadmissible but this form of divine revelation is perfectly ok.&quot; 
I think this interpretation is inconsistent with ANY traditional interpretation, mainly because while it is not formally incoherent, it is very strange and counter-intuitive.  One might also wonder what exactly this solves in terms of justifying practice. If I can justify anything as being part of ongoing revelation with the two criteria that it is internally coherent an justifies this way of life, then I can change anything about that way of life I want to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/interview-with-prof-tamar-ross-on-revelation-round-two/#comment-11125&quot;&gt;JJ&lt;/a&gt;.

&quot;Universe/multiverse&quot; implies existence (or at least relevance) in time/space, and constraint by the laws of nature. Ein Sofe points beyond that. The God-name &quot;Ma-kome&quot; speaks to this: the universe/multiverse is not God&#039;s place - God is the universe/multiverse&#039;s place (so to speak).
Maybe she’s seeing it the way Rav Chayyim Volozhiner sees it in Shaar 4, Perek 6 of the Neffesh Ha-chayyim about TB Gittin 1:

“For the entire Torah, in her generalities, specifics and details, and even what a young student asks of his teacher, all of it was emitted from His (blessed be He) mouth to Moshe at Sinai…”

“And not only that, but even when a person is involved with Torah [here] below, each word that he utters from his mouth, they [emphatic] are the words that are being emitted (so to speak) also from His (blessed be He) mouth at the same actual moment,”

I guess that qualifies all Torah learning as dynamic revelation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In response to Wahl 

I think what Ross says is that mysticism, a rejection of metaphysical naturalism, existentially calls out from within the human soul, and that Judaism as a tradition reflecting a people&#039;s response to that call, is a powerful expression of the human experience of &#039;there&#039;s more to life than atoms and molecules&#039;, especially if it&#039;s your people. This is indeed a strong message - this is why secular teenagers go to Aish and a Chabad.
However it seems to me to be a great argument or theoretical basis for progressive Judaism. I am, along with Wahl, mystified as to how it as an argument for orthodoxy? And should one care? What does orthodoxy offers? Why does the halakhic system need preserving? Presenting the argument as &#039; oh this is a way for well educated orthodox people to handle contradictions&#039; is to me, at least on the surface, intellectually unsatisfying. Better say orthodoxy in terms of a strict system of divinely directed &#039;oughts&#039; is theoretically unsustainable, so choose something different? Saying I don&#039;t want to because then all my friends will view me as out of the club is intellectually suspect albeit humanely understandable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is not a &quot;mythical person.&quot; It isn&#039;t someone who gets up in the morning. It is a narrative. It is a question of months or years of reflection. Heck, its a lifetime struggle of self-definition. Also, don&#039;t underrate the flux years between graduation from high school and marriage. 

 Most people aren&#039;t constantly jumping affiliations, but there are individuals (and even some families: http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new-york/brooklyn-love) who engage in intensive religious quests. They sample from different religions like they&#039;re attending a spiritual buffet. 

What I had in mind, though, because it is more common (at least in my experience), is someone who is deciding between Judaism and secularism. If someone is alienated from Orthodoxy, is struggling with religious truth claims and has basically accepted Bible criticism, the feminist critique or some Dawkinsesque reductionist naturalism, but then gets his hands on a Dr. Ross monograph, all of a sudden the decision to stay in the community or not becomes a question of preference. 
Dr. Ross&#039;s approach can easily be adapted to any religious group. Same for a bunch of other Wittgensteinian approaches to religion, like Hilary Putnam&#039;s for example. People who adopt this approach can give up the search for religious truth. They can stop caring about religious truth. This is true even for the person who slides more gracefully into Dr. Ross&#039;s position in AS&#039;s example. I think Dr. Ross recognizes the arbitrariness of any religious affiliation based on her schema because she worries in several papers about whether it is possible to combine an intellectual non-literalist approach to religion with true religious fervor. 

Incidentally, I think Dr. Ross&#039;s solution is to maintain a type of fragmented self. She suggests that it is important to use images of divine providence or God as a person in the religious life, even though one does not believe in them on a more intellectual level. Ultimately, her solution is to think using Kant, Hegel, Wittgenstein, Rorty and Judith Butler and pray like Tevya the milkman.]]></description>

Who is this mythical person who arises in the morning and has to decide which religion to follow or whether to become a secularist? Prof. Ross is very clearly articulating a position for existing Orthodox Jews of a certain intellectual stripe who she see&#039;s as having become stuck in an unresolvable modern rationalist dialectic in which religious truth vies with scientific truth and various other moral truths (such as feminist theory) leading to a very fragmented and ultimately incoherent belief system, and in turn to a fragmented self. Take it or leave it, she is offering some sort of way out; albeit one that deflates the notion of &#039;true&#039; regarding religious assertions to a degree that most coreligionists would find troubling.

Of course, what makes a given idea appealing is often that its alternatives are unreasonable. And, for various reasons Modern Orthodoxy has kept going with the idea that it is utterly reasonable to endlessly slice and dice religious literature with an eye toward discerning what of it is trans-historically true and what of it is historically contingently &#039;true&#039;. 
That&#039;s great if you want to feel like your way is more reasonable that R. Moshe Meielman because you think that dinosaurs existed. 
If however, you are looking toward more serious issues, say that you think that feminist theory offers a profoundly compelling critique of the structure of society (and not merely a good argument for paying men and women the same hourly wage), and you combine that with basically any historical critical approach, then you may find that you&#039;ve sliced and diced your way down to such a razor thin notion of what religious transhistorical truth consists in, that making the leap from there to a Rossian position is actually a small and fairly reasonable step to take.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While this interview makes it slightly clearer how Professor Ross&#039;s views flow out of traditional Judaism, it still suffers from some of the same problems people noted in the last interview.

Last time Rabbi Dr. Brill asked if the Torah wasn&#039;t given in the traditional way, what differentiates the Torah from Shakespeare or Buddhism? Dr. Ross replied that Judaism &quot;is the cultural-linguistic system into which we were born and were educated.  In light of its remarkable spiritual legacy and resilience, we view it as offering a compelling prescription for life, ethics, and recognition of a spiritual dimension of reality beyond the everyday.&quot; In this interview she seems to have added that Judaism helps promote human flourishing.

But using the language of traditional Judaism as a picture to organize your life around is not the only way to achieve human flourishing. Nor is it necessarily the best way, as any look at a bunch of neurotic Post-Orthodox Jews will confirm. Think Nathan Englander, or better yet, Shalom Auslander.

Ultimately, it becomes a question of personal narrative. Does Judaism fit into my life? Am I comfortable in the community, am I comfortable with the rituals. The question of values is gone. If I don&#039;t like Jewish values, according to Dr. Ross&#039;s model of Dynamic Revelation, I can bring in new ones. I can claim Peter Singer is God&#039;s voice in our time, if I find his views convincing. I can even ignore unpalatable parts of the liturgy (see her essay &quot;Can We Still Pray to God the Father&quot;http://www.academia.edu/4198979/Can_We_Still_Pray_to_God_the_Father). Dr. Ross tells the  angsty teenager (or adult, for that matter) , don&#039;t worry that none of it is true, some stuff seems backwards and the liturgy is sexist. If you are worried about upsetting your parents and uprooting yourself from the community, don&#039;t be. You don&#039;t need to. There is a lot of value in that approach (especially for the angsty teen), but it makes religion groundless. There is no commanding &quot;ought.&quot; It is all a matter of preference. Alasdair MacIntyre points to an arbitrariness in the moral decisions of people who decide between different cogent yet opposing moral arguments that proceed from incommensurable premises. A person deciding between one religion and another, or between Judaism and secularism, will, if they adopt Dr. Ross&#039;s schema, experience a similar arbitrariness. The result might be a soporific, unthinking pluralism, which America already has quite a bit of. On a popular level, Dr. Ross&#039;s approach might start looking like Moralistic Therapeutic Deism. 

I guess this (among other things like her acceptance of Bible criticism and parts of the feminist critique) is what makes many religious Jews so uncomfortable with her approach. The absoluteness of religion, especially Orthodoxy is a way to avoid the arbitrariness of modernity. It&#039;s a way to avoid the terrible freedom that Sartre was always hyperventilating over, a way of escaping risk (Ulrich Beck). But Dr. Ross opens the door once more to modernity (liquid modernity, post-modernity, whatever) and all it&#039;s uncertainty and risk.]]></description>

Dr. Ross replied that Judaism &#8220;is the cultural-linguistic system into which we were born and were educated.  In light of its remarkable spiritual legacy and resilience, we view it as offering a compelling prescription for life, ethics, and recognition of a spiritual dimension of reality beyond the everyday.&#8221; In this interview she seems to have added that Judaism helps promote human flourishing.</p>
<p>But using the language of traditional Judaism as a picture to organize your life around is not the only way to achieve human flourishing. Nor is it necessarily the best way, as any look at a bunch of neurotic Post-Orthodox Jews will confirm. Think Nathan Englander, or better yet, Shalom Auslander.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it becomes a question of personal narrative. Does Judaism fit into my life? Am I comfortable in the community, am I comfortable with the rituals. The question of values is gone. If I don&#8217;t like Jewish values, according to Dr. Ross&#8217;s model of Dynamic Revelation, I can bring in new ones. I can claim Peter Singer is God&#8217;s voice in our time, if I find his views convincing. I can even ignore unpalatable parts of the liturgy (see her essay &#8220;Can We Still Pray to God the Father&#8221;http://www.academia.edu/4198979/Can_We_Still_Pray_to_God_the_Father). Dr. Ross tells the  angsty teenager (or adult, for that matter) , don&#8217;t worry that none of it is true, some stuff seems backwards and the liturgy is sexist. If you are worried about upsetting your parents and uprooting yourself from the community, don&#8217;t be. You don&#8217;t need to. There is a lot of value in that approach (especially for the angsty teen), but it makes religion groundless. There is no commanding &#8220;ought.&#8221; It is all a matter of preference. Alasdair MacIntyre points to an arbitrariness in the moral decisions of people who decide between different cogent yet opposing moral arguments that proceed from incommensurable premises. A person deciding between one religion and another, or between Judaism and secularism, will, if they adopt Dr. Ross&#8217;s schema, experience a similar arbitrariness. The result might be a soporific, unthinking pluralism, which America already has quite a bit of. On a popular level, Dr. Ross&#8217;s approach might start looking like Moralistic Therapeutic Deism. </p>
<p>I guess this (among other things like her acceptance of Bible criticism and parts of the feminist critique) is what makes many religious Jews so uncomfortable with her approach. The absoluteness of religion, especially Orthodoxy is a way to avoid the arbitrariness of modernity. It&#8217;s a way to avoid the terrible freedom that Sartre was always hyperventilating over, a way of escaping risk (Ulrich Beck). But Dr. Ross opens the door once more to modernity (liquid modernity, post-modernity, whatever) and all it&#8217;s uncertainty and risk.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Ross…you say “…a hallmark of R. Kook’s positive attitude to secularism is the understanding that revolutionary and ostensibly destructive developments in the world of ideas are the most significant tools of all, for these are a clear indication that humanity has outgrown more primitive forms of spirituality and is ready for a new, more sublime level.” Modern cosmology in the last fifty years has taught us that the size of the cosmos is much larger than anything we previously thought, with infinite universes, parallel universes, and so on. One important example is the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. We now can even conceive of simulated universes existing on a computer, and it doesn’t stop there. 

Does  this new understanding of infinite universes change our ideas of spirituality? Or is it after Copernicus nothing in our scientific understanding of the heavens above makes much difference? This achievement of secularism in the field of cosmology  is such that we can understand a great deal about nature and the cosmos without resorting to teleology. It is difficult to understand how or why  in a cosmos of uncountable infinity of universes God narrowed his focus to orchestrate the  history of one people on one planet. Yet you do not hesitate to say “Divine providence itself has orchestrated the rise of serious problems with Torah as history so as to lead us, and all of humankind with us, to a new and more subtle understanding of the relationship between divine intent and human interpretation.” Are there any reasons to believe that the filter we choose to interpret our place in the world must be plausible and fit appropriately with our secular beliefs?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shaya,
First, subjectivism is modern. Post-modern does not accept any grand narrative such as evolution or progress; post-modernism does accept the concept of self, rather we are socially constructed; post-modernism is not utility or social functionality - that is modern pragmatism; post-modernism does not reject Rav Nachman for modern naturalism. 
Question three- I assume that she thinks a prophet is from his own inner depths that are unified with God. 
B. If a prophet would arise tomorrow, I think she would now understand and examine him/her using her understanding of Rav Kook.
She does not share your Rav Nachman apocalyptic vision in which the natural order will be overcome or rationality overcome. Nor would she expect a return to earlier forms of religious experience or prophecy. She would interpret Rav Kook in a similar manner. 
And when Rav Kook was writing your favorites of Abulafia, Rav Nachman, and Ramchal&#039;s kabbalah recently published from manuscript were all seen as outside the canon and not to be cited or in Abulafia&#039;s case even heretical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As to the naturalism of science, may it be pointed out that thinkers as early as  the Ari , Ramchal or Rav Nachman viewed nature and natural sciences as Galut, precisely for this reason, and Geulah is overcoming naturalistic atheism. This said  I think for a religious Jew there is a question of loyalty here, to atheism or to beyond that. If in the time of Geulah we will experience God עין בעין, now we must believe and not succumb to this train of thought or try to rationalize and justify it. 
I think Nevuah will be proved quite well according to Rav Kook when prophets reappear. We&#039;ll see what is left of Bible criticism then.  Thanks for answering , waiting for the rest .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shaya,
I will start with the first two questions and maybe get to the other when I can. First, Rav Kook left behind notebooks- the Nazir created the philosophic Orot Hakodesh and Rav Zvi Yehudah created the nationalist Orot, each by selecting passages from the notebooks. Now that the original notebooks have been published it changes the way we see the prior limited works. Philosophers tended to primarily read Orot Hakodesh. 
Second, Rav Kook exhorts us to move beyond our limited categories but he never developed a new system. in fact, he was critical of secular studies. Do we look at where he was pointing or what he actually wrote? 
Third, Rav Zvi Yehudah was only 26 younger than Rav Kook and started to develop and publish his own independent thinking in 1913, long before the notebooks were edited into works. He had many of his own views and we see his hand in those works he edited. 
Fourth, Rav Kook tries to envision a harmonize all of reality. How his frustratingly vague statements play out in reality leads to multiple interpretations. 
About a decade ago at a conference in Israel, a younger speaker - now in her mid 50&#039;s- representing newer trends stated that Rav Kook is not useful for the changes of society for example he essentialized women as emotional and therefore Rav Kook stated that they should not be exposed to Talmud since it is intellectual. The older guard including Shalom Rosenberg, and others raised on the modern Religious Zionist use of  Orot Hakodesh argued against the speaker saying that we should look where he is pointing not what his actual positions were.

Question #2- I think she is saying that miracles and miraculous events cannot be proved and in fact may have be disproved by modern science and archaeology. We cannot prove Matan Torah, Yetziat Mizrayim, or Nevuah and that the study of Biblical History and the naturalism of science do not allow for them.]]></description>
