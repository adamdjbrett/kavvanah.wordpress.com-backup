					<description><![CDATA[Brandes tends to pick halakhic categories like the State of Israel or non-observant Jews, to which most individuals, including poskim, brings their personal values. 

But what about questions such as using a crockpot on Shabbos or the kashrus of industrial whey? Are those also value-laden questions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice interview.  I greatly enjoy Rav Dr. Brandes&#039; writing and the interview was useful for understanding his worldview.  Regarding formalism, it is not just the Hazon Ish.  In an article in Iyunim Hadashim Be&#039;philosophia shel Hahalacha, Dr. Brown opines that in fact most of halacha is formalistic, and the picture is actually skewed in that those who write about philosophy of halacha tend to focus on the thinkers who tend to be less formal and on subject matter that (marriage, conversion, politics) that lend themselves more to a value-based emphasis. 
 Also, having gone through parts of Brown&#039;s book on the Hazon Ish, my understanding is that he suggests that the Hazon Ish&#039;s formalism is actually itself value-based - the value being formalism and strictness, as opposed to lack of awareness of a different approach.]]></description>
