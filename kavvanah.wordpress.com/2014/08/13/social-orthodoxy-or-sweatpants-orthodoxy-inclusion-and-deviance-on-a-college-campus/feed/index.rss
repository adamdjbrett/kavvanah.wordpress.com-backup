					<description><![CDATA[At Cambridge University where Rabbi Sinclair was rabbi, it must be understood that the numbers of Orthodox students are relatively small on American standards, and it sounds like the students he is referring to are the bulk. Of course, I would happy to be corrected or contradicted by Rabbi Sinclair himself. Menachem Schrader]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Sinclair wrote in relevant part:
&quot;Today I note that a couple of these students have become rabbis, a couple more are successful Jewish studies academics living observant lives, another is well-known Jewish educator in the UK, a handful more made aliyah and nearly all of the rest are married to Jews and involved in the Jewish community.&quot;

Aside from the couple of students who became rabbis and  Jewish studies academics, who &quot;live observant lives&quot;,  how many remained Shomer Shabbos , lor could be described for lack of a better purpose as fully Shomrei Torah UMitzvos, and identified with the Orthodox world?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I served as campus rabbi at a well-known British university a decade or so ago. I certainly recognize this phenomenon. Back when I was on campus it troubled me considerably and I spent significant time engaging with the &quot;fringe MO&quot; students, many of whom had been to the best Israeli yeshivot and sems in their gap years but dropped away from observance in college. Today I note that a couple of these students have become rabbis, a couple more are successful Jewish studies academics living observant lives, another is well-known Jewish educator in the UK, a handful more made aliyah and nearly all of the rest are married to Jews and involved in the Jewish community. I recognize that the social tolerance of the campus MO community enabled them to stay affiliated while doing whatever experimentation and questioning of their upbringing and education they felt they needed to do at college.]]></description>

Is there any literature about the acceptance of &quot;Darker-skinned&quot; Jews within different denominations of Judaism (or streams of Orthodoxy)?

Similar to my question below, is there any literature about the experiences of others who might encounter MO communities from outside the mainstream (e.g., converts and/or Jews of color)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The real question is whether the answers would be the same or similar of students  on other campusesn that offer equally strong resources for MO students.

					<description><![CDATA[Social acceptance in American Modern Orthodoxy, to my eyes, is dependent more on appearance and cultural identity than on behavior.   Anyone who injects himself into a Modern Orthodox environment; actively participates while they’re within that social context; and speaks no ill of Orthodoxy outside the Orthodox social context, is welcome as long as s/he looks the part.  Caucasians face little barrier – modest dress isn’t expected, and males don’t need a headcovering as long as they want to be involved.  Darker-skinned males, however, more often need to wear a yarmulke in order to gain acceptance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really fascinating and results do resonate with my intuition but I find the study to be deeply flawed
1. All Brandeis students, so a very self selective group
2. Sample size of 20

Not sure what inference one can draw from that]]></description>

Someone on FB commented that the BT would have more difficulties than someone raised in the culture.
He gave a variety of answers for how one who is lax self -reflects --as having to work things out, as being in transition, as being in a different place, as valuing social integration over ritual, as the ritual not speaking to them, and also as a not very observant. But it is sin without significant guilt or boundary crossing. I think the ideology is a vague &quot;I believe what Orthodox Jews value&quot; even if their personal beliefs are elsewhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The idea that the most important thing for being MO is having been raised MO (regardless of current practice) resonates with me based on much of the under-40 y.o. shul scene where I currently live (uws).  
What happens to baalei teshuvah in this context?  Would someone observant who doesn&#039;t know the culture be more or less mainstream than someone raised MO but lax?
Does the author define how he uses &quot;orthodox ideology&quot; here?  if one is nonobservant but keeps to &quot;ortodox ideology&quot; does that mean one sees onesself as a sinner?  or is the ideology looser than that? torah misinai?  pro-israel?]]></description>
