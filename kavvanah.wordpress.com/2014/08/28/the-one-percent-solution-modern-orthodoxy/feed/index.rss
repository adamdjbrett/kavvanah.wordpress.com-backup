					<description><![CDATA[Just want to comment on the demographics in this post: 

According the 2011 JCSNY survey, MO women (in the NY metropolitan region) have an average of 2.5 children, comfortably above the replacement rate. 29% drop-out is not quite as bad as it seems; if you flip it, 71% retention rate for MO is pretty high, even if a good chunk of it is more left. I don&#039;t think the question is how many MO adults there are, but how many kids there are - that&#039;s what predicts growth. If MO women keep having children at this rate, there&#039;s really no reason to be overly worried about the growth or at least maintenance of the religious movement. 

I am not saying it can&#039;t disintegrate or face serious challenges, but I don&#039;t see its demise as imminent enough to warrant questions about its survival. 

Ultimately, I do think this is more about demographics than about ideology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to say that your interesting typologies of MO by generations, cultural interests and so on reveal a glaring failure on the part of MO. It lacks a comprehensive independent understanding of the new situation in the world post 1990. To the extent there is any political vision it is one of complete identification with Israel, and  a disappointment and anger that the world sees things differently. To the extent there is any prism it is  the  self centered vision of right wing Israel.  Recent events, especially the outbreak of anti-Antisemitism in Europe, the sudden emergence of ISIS, the unexpected strength of Hamas, and the fear and expectation that Iran will have nuclear weapons are just examples of a new kind of world that impinges  to Jewish interests. More generally there is a sense that the world political situation is getting out of control against a background of a series of  ecological disasters. i would say most Jews and certainly Orthodox Jews are both anxious and mystified. You can’t expect Jewish thinkers to have much impact unless they have something insightful to say about the new world we live in. I can’t think of a single rabbi or theologian or Jewish academic dealing with these issues.

In earlier decades, the 1880&#039;s to 1910 in the fight for labor unions, in the 1930&#039;s with the Jewish socialists and communists and in the 1970&#039;s with the emergence of Jewish Neoconservatives there were genuine attempts to understand the world. Today with a world that is really different from the 20th century and its battles against fascism and communism there is only a sort of mystification. What is common to generations X,Y,Z, millennials, Social Orthodoxy  and the other variants of MO is that they all are essentially apolitical…they hardly ever look at the world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Laity&quot; for Northeastern Modern Orthodoxy are often highly Jewishly educated, sometimes spending as many years learning in Yeshiva as the Rabbi. So using &quot;Lay-Driven&quot; in this context is misleading. 

A &quot;Partnership Minyan&quot; put together by someone with YU smicha who works as a lawyer is not &quot;lay-led&quot; in the traditional sense.

On that note, Modern Orthodoxy traditionally had a laity which was Traditional and did not keep Kosher or Shabbos by the the rules of the Shulchan Aruch. This is still the case in many Orthodox Synagogues. Neither the article nor the responses seem to address this demographic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I want to know is ... will people be able to eat strawberries in 2050?  That seems to be the heart of the issue.  Joking aside, one point that seems to be not mentioned is that &quot;modernity&quot; and &quot;Torah&quot; seem to have been closer together in 1964 than they are in 2014.  Perhaps the distance seemed just as great then (?), but certain things that are required to be considered socially modern today seem harder to reconcile with Orthodoxy.  In 1964, many more people were traditionally religious and it was socially understood that people would stay loyal to their religious group.  At the same time, it was clear to many immigrants from Europe that America was an entirely different society, one that required new thinking.  Today, being traditionally religious is challenging in any liberal environment, even if one&#039;s thinking is extremely liberal.  At the same time, becoming yeshivish or chassidic no longer means that you cannot get a reasonable job.  Nor does it mean that you can&#039;t practice yoga or go to the gym.  

The truth is that RW Orthodoxy *has* changed in response to modernity.  No, there are no women&#039;s tefillah groups but what do you call this entirely new ideology of female superiority, the mystery of women&#039;s ways, the deep, spiritual importance of challah, tsnuit as an opportunity for personal transformation rather than a sign of compliance?  Those ideas do not come to us from the 2nd, 10th, or 17th centuries.  There&#039;s a reason there are never any footnotes to traditional sources in those articles.  That&#039;s adaptation to feminism and without it, no young woman (regardless of her background) would find RW Orthodoxy relevant.  Children of modern Orthodox may shift right but they don&#039;t join Satmar or Gur.  That&#039;s because while they want to deepen their religious practice and perhaps simplify their lives (and their children&#039;s lives) with fewer choices, they are still modern in their thinking.  Only a RW system that can explain itself in modern terms will be intelligible to them.

From the sidelines of the C movement, I salute my MO brothers and sisters, both LW and RW.  We each have our problems, but I believe that they are good problems to have.]]></description>
