					<description><![CDATA[&quot; The great Jewish historian Salo Baron decades ago argued that a relatively small group of 100 rabbis, 100 lay leaders, 100 academics, and 100 communal professionals, who are well-versed in both civilizations could transform the entire ethos of the Jewish community in a positive direction.&quot;

Perhaps relevant is what Rav Soloveitchik said about it being the quality and not the quantity of committed Jews that&#039;s most important:

					<description><![CDATA[Nothing to add about the Bible issues. But on the social front, it may sounds brutal, but it&#039;s likely true that the Jewish future will come from those who don&#039;t intermarry. Pew found that 17% of people who said they were partly Jewish were raising their children as Jewish. So while it might not be kind, what grounds are there for disagreeing with Bayme&#039;s assessment that the community should pour all its resources into those not (and not yet) intermarried?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Bayme taught a superb course on the Holocaust which I took at YU. The readings, lectures and discussions were outstanding and gave me a great insight into the various factors that led to the rise of Nazism and the Holocaust. I also audited Dr. Bayme&#039;s course on Jewish history, and found many of the sources incompatible and well beyond the pale of standard Orthodox hashkafa. The facts remain that R Lichtenstein, both in the 1960s and in the YU Judaica book , set forth where he disagreed with R Greenberg.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If one accepts genuine denominational pluralism within Judaism and the validity of Conservative and/or Reform approaches to Halakhah, why bother with &quot;Partnership Minyanim&quot; or other recently liberal Modern Orthodox innovations? Why not just have complete egalitarian minyanim? 

Either Conservative Judaism&#039;s approach to Halakhah is wrong (and therefore pluralism is rejected) and that is why one is limited to creative innovations like &quot;Women&#039;s Tefillah Groups&quot; or &quot;Partnership Minyanim&quot; or it is correct and their is no need for liberal Modern Orthodox inventions as any such needs could be fulfilled within Conservative Synagogues.

As Yitz Greenberg’s theology includes the non-binding nature of Halakha and the acceptance of Jesus as a failed Messiah how is his theology Orthodox (even Modern Orthodox)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Portions of it [Torah]may be rooted in different historical records, but that does not make the text less authoritative as a work of theology. What does make it authoritative is that it is the inheritance of the Jewish people-morasha beit yaacov.&quot;

No, what makes it authoritative is that G-d is the sole author.  Mr. Bayme&#039;s view is classic non-Orthodox theology.]]></description>
