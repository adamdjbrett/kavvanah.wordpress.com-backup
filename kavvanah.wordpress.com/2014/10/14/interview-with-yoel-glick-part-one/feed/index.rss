					<description><![CDATA[I find it quite interesting that this came into my path as we study Parshat Noach, the many nations that were scattered all have access to part of Higher Power&#039;s knowledge.  This book brings together two of those many parts.  I find it both exciting to see the commonalities and scary that we are once again closing the gaps.  The nations were purposely separated a long time ago for our own good so I believe we must unify carefully, keeping the good of all foremost in our minds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The explicit syncretism  of Glick’s approach makes me extremely uncomfortable.

While I, more or less, welcome academic and intellectual comparative religion in general and comparative ascetic theology or “spirituality” or “devotion” in particular, however, actually integrating another religion’s religious practices into one’s personal devotion is categorically different. 

Perhaps it is because of Deuteronomy 12:30-31 (&quot;Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God&quot;).

On the other hand I recognize that utilizing “non-Jewish”, Christian or Islamic theology and ideas has been continually practiced from before Maimonides through Rav Soloveitchik. One could argue that those Jewish philosophers see an appealing idea and “find” it within Jewish sources or traditions. But I recognize that such claims are more than occasionally disingenuous. 

Nonetheless, how would most traditional Jews feel about a commentary on the Siddur mixing Kabbalistic and Trinitarian doctrines? Would Glick approve of such an approach?]]></description>
