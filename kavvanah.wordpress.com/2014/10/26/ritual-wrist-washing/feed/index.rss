					<description><![CDATA[&quot; Hands are then held upward to prevent impure water falling on the fingers.&quot;
actually it seems that the washing required for bread{which is the only washing requiring a vessel} is only a &#039;r&#039;viet&#039; for both hands. in other words this  amount would only be sufficient for the tips of the fingers and all the other &#039;gesticulations&#039; have somehow worked their way into the ritual.
thus there would be no concern for the water to be dispersed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is the purpose of ritual hand washing only symbolic? Or is it strictly hygienic? Who can make sense of this?:

“To wash the hands to the extent that the sages decreed, namely five knots, which contain fourteen joints. 
Similarly there are fourteen joints in the left [hand], making twenty-eight joints. And against these twenty-eight [are the] ‘the כֹּחַ [koaḥ] power, of YHWH’ [where the gematria of כֹּחַ (koaḥ) is 28], and these are the twenty-eight letters of the first verse in the Works of Creation [Genesis 1:1], and about them it is written: 
And now, I pray you, let the כֹּחַ [koaḥ] power, of Adonai be great [Numbers 14:17]. The ten fingers correspond to the ten sayings at the creation of the world: 
For this reason, the sages of the Mishnah taught: Whoever is careless over the washing of the hands is uprooted from the world [BT Sotah 4b]. Why is this? It is because the ten fingers of the hands and the twenty-eight joints of the fingers contain the mystery of the ten sayings and the twenty-eight letters with which the world was created” (Ra’aya Meheimna Pinḥas).]]></description>
