					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting - glad to see some information coming from someone who bothered to study Hindu communities in-depth. I will re-read later to wrap my head around all the denominational differences but a few things stood out to me -

&quot;The major difference is that the infinite Siva emanates and maintains the world personified by his consort Shakti- who is not considered a separate god from Siva. One could compare Shakti to the real of the kavod, the sefirot, the celestial hierarchy of the medieval Jewish cosmologies. (Christian comparative works treat Shakti as the Logos). &quot;

Shakti sounds an awful lot like the Shekhina.

&quot;Shaivas often pray to Ganesha for worldly things, reserving prayers to Shiva for worship and asking for spiritual insight, help and advancement. Thus they might ask Ganesha for help in preparing and taking an exam, but ask Shiva to help us see our true spiritual nature.&quot;

What does it mean that they pray to Ganesha and Shiva separately, if they see them as aspects of essentially the same entity? Is that just a matter of liturgical formalism? Are they never interchangeable?]]></description>
