					<description><![CDATA[@Steve Gold thanks for your comment. And yet the ancient Lilium Candidum of Israel resembles a six pointed star. Hence, שׁוֹשָׁן (shoshan) lily, may be cognate with שֵׁשׁ (shesh) six. Google image search Capernaum Synagogue (Israel 2nd century CE).

&quot;I will be as dew unto Israel; he shall blossom כַּשּׁוֹשַׁנָּה as the lily&quot; (Hosea 14:6).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Avalon&#039;s work is true to its sources, and I totally agree with Steve Gold. It was Osho who took tantrik works and represented them as a celebration of personal expression and freedom of an individual. Avalon is not a poetic, sexy, laced with jokes easy to read book, but a real attempt to convey the depth and beauty of the tradition by someone who genuinely appreciated the system and studied with respectable Tantrik masters in India. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a little confused by some of your comments which appear to contain mixed messages, at least as I read it. You seem to be critical of Avalon’s work, indicating it is not authentic Eastern thought, but rather an invention of Western Orientalism, relating it, apparently with disapproval, as being embraced by New Age proponents. It appears that one of your objections might be a semantic/labeling issue, that real Eastern tantra has to do with an approach to ritual, and doesn’t have anything to do with Avalon’s description of the kundalini process  and description of the chakra system (although you do not use the word “kundalini”). I agree that there are aspects of what is called “tantra” that relate to ritualizing what might otherwise be deemed mundane activities, including, but not limited to, the sexual act, which the West tends to obsess over as the only subject of tantra. And I tend to agree that what Avalon describes is more often labeled as the “kundalini” system and process. However, I believe there are also many variations of authentic Eastern traditions that relate tantra to the concept of Shiva and Shakti being in union, then separating, which separation causes the appearance of Maya, of the dimension of relativity (involution), and the spiritual process of the movement of Shakti to reunite with Shiva by rising up through the spine and chakras as spiritual growth (evolution). In any case, it appears to me that Avalon’s work is divulging information gleaned from and guided by genuine Eastern sources, and is not just an invention of Western Orientalism. Certainly, movements like Theosophy may have taken the Eastern sources and incorporated a Western spin onto them, as noted by Avalon, but it seems to me that Avalon’s work stays true to its Eastern sources, whether it is called “kundalini” or “tantra”.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The image we know as the Mogen David, the Jewish star, is not unique to and did not originate with Judaism. It is the image of the heart chakra in the yoga system. Images can be found in India in which the OM symbol is incorporated into the center of the &quot;Jewish Star&quot;. It looks like there is some other yantra-type image in the middle of the star in question. Likewise, the swastika is a traditional image in Indian spirituality, which was appropriated by Hitler. Swastikas and Jewish stars are both quite common around India.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another wonderful post. A few additional thoughts:

With regard to the body, Tantra and Tantric derived practices do a bit more than weave; in Hatha Yoga, a Tantra-derived practice, the goal is to actually unite Shiva and Shakti in one&#039;s own &quot;energetic&quot; or &quot;subtle&quot; body(Sukshma Sharira) &quot;by means of the now well known Kundalini Shakti. This was introduced to the West by what was perhaps Avalon&#039;s most famous book, The Serpent Power. By means of of asana, pranayama, etc one brings the Kundalini energy up thru the chakras where it unites with Shiva in the crown, or Sahasrara chakra.  This Tantric goal, and not &quot;flexibility&quot;, &quot;calmness&quot; etc is THE goal of Hatha Yoga, as stated in all the classic texts.

Tantra not only blurred the lines among various Hindu practices; it also, to some extent , blurred some lines between Hinduism and Buddhism as well, as a number of Buddhist Tantric groups, such as Vajrayana, developed alongside the Hinfu ones and were quite similar. For more on this, see the volume on Tantra by the late and sorely missed Georg Feuerstein.]]></description>
