Everyone in the Orthodox community that I know (with the exception of the infirm and the elderly) fasts at least on Yom Kippur and Tisha be-Av, and almost everyone also fasts on the daylight fast days (minor fasts) -- including women and young girls over 12. 

A number of Chasidim also fast on the two cycles of B&quot;H&quot;B after Sukkot and Pesach, although this is less common these days.
