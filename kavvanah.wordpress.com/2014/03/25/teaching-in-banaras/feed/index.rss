					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;they rejected James idea of religion and mysticism as a personal feeling done alone to the alone. For them, one requires a guru to teach you how to control your body and mind and one needs to submit to an ashram and to practice the classical techniques. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very interesting. I can see echoes of both in our tradition. On the one hand, we have Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s Lonely Man of Faith articulating somethign which may be a truism, that certain experiences are inherently internal, hence the man of faith is lonely despite having many friends. This chasim isn&#039;t only between different religious groups, but even to a lesser extent between two equally observant members of the Tribe. On the other hand, we know from the Merkava tradition of the master-student relationship that was so crucial in developing &quot;devekutically.&quot; In fact, the admonition of not engaging in nistar until one has become satiated with &quot;bread and water&quot; is another broader example of the need for guidance.

However, Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s expression of the essential existential loneliness of the religious experience is something which I find a truism (as there are no objective physical manifestations of the religious experience - cf. Daniel&#039;s prophetic dream in presence of his colleagues), and so must the Hindus not deal with the very same observation?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is actually a very valid and interesting point, Uziya.

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting. I would only point out that orthodox and ultra-orthodox Jews tend to view he holocaust in a similar way those Cambodian monks view the years of Khmer Ruoge - it is just another episode of persecution (though an extreme one). The destruction of the two temples is much more significant. For the Israeli public, too, the Holocaust is not as nearly as central as for the American Jewish community.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Alan. You have made up for lost time with this delightful posting, full of information and insights that most of us otherwise would have no access to. Your teaching-learning experience in India sounds like it has been mutually illuminating, and you surely have done much to promote greater understanding of Jews and Judaism.]]></description>

Knowledge of Indian religion, or anything else, from google or ignorance or kiruv literature does not get posted. (I let a few get by in the last few months.)
