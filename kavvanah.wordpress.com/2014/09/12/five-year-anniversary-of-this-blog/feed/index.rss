					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on your 5th anniversary. I think your blog is fantastic and I have never been disappointed when reading a new contribution. You take me to places I would never have anticipated and you don&#039;t patronise your readers. May you go from strength to strength. If you are ever teaching in Europe, please mention it in a blog, it would be nice to attend a class if possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/five-year-anniversary-of-this-blog/#comment-11804&quot;&gt;Larry Yudelson (@yudel)&lt;/a&gt;.

I only have so much time. And in the end, when I did 3-4 short posts on the same topic people wanted them combined.It is not about hit counts. When I wrote only for friends and former students, I could explain things in a line, now with a wider readership posts are misread if I do not take the time to articulate what I want to say.
 People prefer me once a week (or twice) so they can think about it., rather than having to bookmark me in Pocket and never get back to it.
