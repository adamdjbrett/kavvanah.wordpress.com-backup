Thanks.  I guess that&#039;s along the line of what we were thinking that there&#039;s a gamut of beliefs from pure avoda zara to something closer to us.  But of course a well-off educated Hindu might simplify that that to poor and uneducated versus educated.  But yes, some day I will try to learn more and thank you for these research terms.  I love your analogy to Jubilees!  :)]]></description>

Berel, good point. In many cases the statues are tashmeishei kedushah and not how the West conceives of them]]></description>

There is a fascinating recent account of idol-production in modern India in chapter 7 of  William Dalrymple&#039;s *Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India*. It gave me a new way to think about idols; the people making the idols sort of remind me of Jews making tefillin and constantly saying &quot;leshem mitzvat tefillin&quot;. You can read it online at chrome://epubreader/content/reader.xul?id=8]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/passage-to-india/#comment-11748&quot;&gt;David Z&lt;/a&gt;.

David, The first thing you would have to do is not rely on Western textbooks even if read by your father. Ignore what you wrote and go learn. There are many denominations of Hinduism- Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism, and each of these break down into further categories some without any minor gods, some with incarnations, some with only a high god, some with many gods, some with folk polytheism. Here in the US, they break down into denominations such as Sai Baba, Swami Naharayan BAPS, Gayatri, Tamil or even Guyanese.Study each of these separately. There is no one category or halakhah that would cover all of them. 

Judging the Hinduism denominations  from afar based on generalizations is like say &quot;African religions&quot; or Native American religions&quot; is a stereotype.  The Hindu HAF is currently working on textbook reform in California to overcome stereotypical depictions of ancient Hinduism as contemporary Hinduism. 

Your textbook knowledge is like judging contemporary Judaism based solely on Jubilees, the Zohar and Spinoza. Both contemporary Jews and Hindus follow the teachings of the last 200 years that has been exposed to modernity, suburban life, science and psychology. We distinguish between Reform and Orthodox Judaism, Secular and Hasidic, rational and mystical when Jews are only a mote in world&#039;s religions.
Hinduism in contrast is a billion believers with almost as much diversity as all three faith of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam combined. Go and learn first.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know about actual p&#039;sak (which would be interesting), but the way my father explains Hindusim to me based on his own readings and conversations with Hindu friends is that the Hindu &quot;gods&quot; are avatars of a single godhead, just that nobody worships the godhead itself.  Instead, they all choose different avatars and in that way, all the avatars of the godhead are worshiped and so the godhead itself.  Which sounds mighty like ramba&quot;m explaining how avoda zara started.  But Hindusim seems to have retained the &quot;start&quot; rather than the end of avioda zara (although I also understand that the less educated Hindus don&#039;t necessarily have a good grasp of what it is that&#039;s going on in Hindu theology and may really be ovde avoda zara.  I&#039;d love for someone to correct me on this, but if I were writing a t&#039;;shuva, I guess I&#039;d go along this line.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you come across any responsa literature dealing with relations between local Jews in India and their Hindu neighbors, i.e., did anyone come up with explanations why the Hindus do not fall under the Talmudic definition of idolators (parallel to the way Ashkenazi poskim let Christianity off the hook by claiming that non-Jews are not held accountable for shituf)?]]></description>
