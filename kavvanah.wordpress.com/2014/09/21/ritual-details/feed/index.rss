					<description><![CDATA[This discussion is fascinating.

Can we compare the metaphysics or theology underlying the need for correcting ritual mistakes. 

The obvious question that most Christians and non-traditional Jews would ask is does God really care is we make a mistake in a ritual if we more or less get it right.

One approach, favored by Kabbalists, is that there are metaphysical consequences for the proper and improper performance of ritual. Another, very theistic, approach is that a personal God asked you to perform a ritual this way and to change it would harm your relationship with him.

There is also the psychological component that having performed a ritual strictly a particular way for one’s whole life, to make a mistake is extremely jarring psychologically.

For most American Orthodox Jews, I would attribute the second &#038; third reasons.

What about for the average religious Hindu?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The broader project of comparing Jewish and Hindu rituals takes on increased prominence now that India is led by a frum Hindu who is fasting this week. Wikipedia tells me the Navrati fast (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navratri&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navratri&lt;/a&gt;) is different from Yom Kippur, Tzom Gedalya, or Rammadan in its particulars (which seem to have a wide range of variance.) The details of the Hindu lunar calendar show that it is more like the pre-Hillel ad hoc Jewish calendar than the Muslim calendar (leap months are added to keep holidays in their seasons).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are there any cross-cultural comparisons of ritual that include Greco Roman, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Egyptian religions? I wonder to what extant Jewish and Hindu commonalities reflect parallel evolution, and how much they might reflect shared roots in ancient, pre-historic religion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating stuff. What I find especially interesting is the way in which a number of the rituals you describe have an entirely different value assigned to them in Yoga(I am here referring to the classical or Raja yoga of Patanjali) than they do in Mimamsa- and that both are considered valid darshanas of Hinduism. Three rituals you describe were especially striking in this regard-

1 Sankalpa - In Yoga, generating Sankalpa Shakti is considered absolutely crucial, and spiritual progress is almost unthinkable with out it.  Compare this to the Mimamsa you describe, where certain rituals are entirely valid without it.

2 The Gayatri mantra- I have heard this chanted numerous times in various Yogic settings (usually 108 per session) and I have never heard it referred to as an atonement ritual. This usage is also not obvious from the text itself.

3 Aarti - Again, I have always heard this described in Yogic circles as imparting blessing energy, without so much as a word about its effects vis a vis atonement. (Additionally, the &quot;waving&quot; of light during Aarti seemed to me to have some strong resonances with certain Jewish rituals).

Thanks again for sharing this.
