					<description><![CDATA[My Litvak-Misnagdish side, my Ish HaHalakhah side, agrees with the critique of Fleischaker that:
“We might want to endorse wordless encounter theology if we think it is coherent, spiritually attractive, and a helpful way of framing our Jewish commitments.  It is none of these things, however. “

I further generally agree with Fleischacker that even with regard to R. Mendel of Rymanov, in Fleischacker’s words,“it is absurd to suppose that any hasid would have denied the literal truth of the Torah — would have described it as wholly a ‘midrash.’” As Fleischacker points out, even a silent aleph is a letter, an element of a word. One could say it is a vowel, or indiscrete speech, or even a breath, but it is headed towards articulation. There is a movement towards expression, communication, articulation of an idea, a thought, not just wordless encounter. Zach Truboff’s mention of Idel’s interpretation is exactly correct on this point.

 “Wordless encounter theology” cannot serve as a basis for understanding the revelation of the normative law of a society, of halakhah.

 However, I’m not at all certain that there is no room for a kind of “wordless encounter theology” when it comes to the side of the “Ish HaDat.” Remember that, in Plato, the “Ideas” and “Virtues” and “Laws” serve as norms for the proper discipline and structuring of the society at large as well as for forming the character and soul of the individual. Similarly, the Torah in Philo Judaeus serves as Law for the society as well as instruction for the individual. In the Bible, the Torah of Moses is identified with the Musar avikha veTorat Immekha of Proverbs and the Wisdom literature, which gives instruction in Wisdom and knowledge of The Way for the individual and his soul, for the Torat HaAdam or for Torat HaNefesh.

My problem, then, arises when explanations taken from the realm of Ish HaDat and Torat HaNefesh are used as a basis for normative halakhah, when halakhah gets “psychologized” so that psychological needs of the individual soul start determining halakhah for the society. This is quite a widespread problem today. 

Further, having read Part II as well as Fleischacker’s responses to comments, I don’t agree with Fleischacker’s “progressive and traditional” theology of the “Words of the Living God.” Believing that the Torah is somehow God’s Word but not in some sense a kind of “Eternal Truth” seems to me almost as problematic as some Purva Mimamsa Hindu philosophic traditions that believe in the sanctity of the Vedic texts and the practices and laws prescribed in them but are not theistic. In this case, Fleischacker believes in God and that the Torah is a sacred text, which contains, presumably, sacred truth, but he doesn’t want to say that that truth is unchanging or eternal in any way. I’d say, if Torah doesn’t contain eternal verities, it might as well be godless. Fleischacker actually mentions this possibility, belief in the Torah without belief in God, and dismisses it as not really making much sense, but I don’t see why what he proposes, a Torah which has language, “Divine” language, but is stripped of any unchanging core of meaning, is any better as an alternative.  I understand why Fleischacker wants to say this: He wants to leave more room for interpretation, for a more fluid, modern, somewhat late-Heideggerian  hermeneutic, which he wants to make equivalent to Midrash or allegory. He wants to make “truth” relative to the era in which we live through such interpretive/hermeneutical juggling. Further, Fleischacker would seem to want to change halakhah based upon such interpretation, unlike some in “Orthodox Jewish” or Hindu Purva Mimamsa-based communities who are more committed to maintaining a very strict and fairly unchanging  “orthopraxis” without regard to what they believe. I just don’t think either one is very Jewish, either. Of course, Plato and Philo always felt that “truth” had to be unchanging and eternal. I’m not sure I can prove the same for Rabbinic thought, but even the term “Midrash” comes from “seeking,” engaging in dialectic to reveal some old truth that needed further revelation. There are “hiddushim” in Torah, but this comes from a Pi`el root which involves “renewing and making anew” something which was old and eternal.

I prefer Platonic/Philonic thought, the basis, according to Harry Wolfson, for medieval philosophy, which believes in truths revealed in the Torah which are, in principle, unchanging and eternal. However, it is the abstract laws and ideas, the forms and concepts of the Torah, which are really eternal. These concepts are tied to the Sacred Words of Scripture. The actual texts, the words used, are very important: After all, according to Plato’s Cratylus (and quoted by Eusebius in interpretating Gen. 2:19), names and words are precisely suited to the forms and ideas which they convey. But ultimately, what we understand in our world are only “shadows on the wall” of the real “forms.” The Torah as the Logos, the Divine Word, reveals us the “True Forms” of things in a much clearer way than we could know them by ourselves, but they still need clarification through dialectical argument and homiletical as well as allegorical interpretation. “New” interpretations reveal sides of the forms and laws which weren’t visible earlier: Rabbi Akiva taught many laws which were unrecognizable to Moshe Rabbenu, but were inherent in the Torah taught to Moses at Sinai. And, of course, mystically, our Torah is derived from a Primordial Divine Wisdom/Logos, a “Torah Qedumah,” which pre-existed the Scriptural texts we have. But it must be “Qedumah,” primordial, because Truth must be, in some sense, eternal and unchanging. I’d argue that traditional Midrash, and our modern exegeses and adaptation of halakha, as well, have been based upon and should be based upon the adaptation and application of eternal verities, closer to Hellenistic allegorical interpretations to discover the eternal forms/ideas which were meant.

I’d argue that even when it comes to the “truths” of the “Ish HaDat,” of the Torat HaNefesh, such truths must be at base unchanging. But from the point of view of the individual soul and its advancement, the communion with God, the experience of God’s Presence, may be as important as any verbal content of Revelation. Knowledge of God’s Word becomes, for the individual soul,  Knowledge of God’s Love. And eventually, the Torat HaNefesh, the revelation of God found in one’s individual holy Soul, his Divine Breath or Divine Image, must be somehow squared with both the Law of Nature as well as with the Torat Moshe, the Holy Law for the Holy People, the Torah for Jewish society, the halakah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have very much appreciated Prof. Fleischacker&#039;s articles and the discussion generated around them. I would add one additional point to strengthen his comments regarding R&#039; Menachem Mendel of Rymanov. Moshe Idel has argued, quite convincingly in my opinion, against Scholem&#039;s interpretation of the soundless Aleph reflecting the open-ended nature of revelation. Idel points out that really what R&#039; Menachem Mendel of Rymanov really said was that they heard the kamatz aleph which was supposed to evoke the image of a melamed teaching his students the Hebrew language for the first time. Here is the citation from Idel (Old Worlds, New Mirrors On jewish Mysticism and Twentieth Century Jewish Thought (p.123-124) )

The phrase kamatz aleph, occurring in the formulations of the three Hasidic masters surveyed here, is constituted by two words by which every Eastern European Jewish male child started to learn Hebrew in Heder at the age of three. The sonorous ambiance that accompanies the childen’s collective recitation of those two words is, in my opinion, quintessential for understanding the underlying background of the Hasidic discussions of the revelation at Sinai. In my opinion, it was the heder setting, in which the teacher pronounced kamatz aleph and the small children repeated it loudly, that the Hasidic masters had in mind and transposed to Sinai. Instead of the solemn silence of the inchoate revelation, in fact some form of manifestation, as Scholem assumes, we have here the sonorous community of the teacher, the melamed, which is projected on high as G-d, and the Israelites in the role of children.]]></description>
