					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see the contradiction,for the Toldot Yaakov Yosef source, for instance, one draws into the letters in order to encounter the Ein Sof, which is beyond them. In mystical thought many times the transcendent reality is not only to be found &quot;out there&quot;, but in &quot;here&quot;. However, both terms represent an unpresentable reality. For in the Ein Sof there is no language, there is only the Ein Sof, which is already too much to say and better to be silent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/sam-fleischacker-words-of-the-living-god-part-ii/#comment-12496&quot;&gt;Gene&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m not sure what Elliot Wolfson cites as the basis for this premise.
Here are a couple of primary sources amongst many more from Hasidic teachings that would imply the contrary:

&#039;...Each word encompasses Worlds, Souls and Divinity...The words that you speak should have this intention that each word embodies all three levels.&#039; (Baal Shem Al HaTorah; 17)

&#039;The letters are vessels and garments and one needs to draw into them while pronouncing them, the spiritual flow within them and the presence of the Ein Sof who gives life to all things.&#039; (Toldot Ya&#039;akov Yosef, v,3a)

It appears that rather than overcoming language to achieve divine encounter, one is expected to merge with the body of language in order to behold the divine luminescence latent within.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It would appear that the author fails to take into account the Hasidic sources which most of these theologians are indebted to and their kabbalistic origins. Using the work of Elliot R. Wolfson to understand the kabbalsitic terminology in contemporary jargon, it would be more appropriate to say that God is beyond language, but we can only encounter God paradoxically through the overcoming of language through language.
The other gist of his argument is completely in line with many post-modern understandings of history, view Jaffe on Gadammarrian hermeneutics in regard to Halacha.
All in all his critique against modernist historical criticism is well placed, but the &quot;wordless&quot;theologies he attacks shows a lack of grasping the source material of these theologies in the Kabbalah, which may even show a hyperlinguilistic understanding of existence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am very sympathetic to the Fleischacker reconstruction of Orthodox theology. It will take some time to understand how the different parts fit together, and there will certainly be objections to giving up the dictation model of revelation. But in the end there will not be many plausible models left standing, and my guess is that Fleischacker&#039;s variation, with its emphasis on the priority of objective moral principles will be one of the leading candidates.
Prof. Fleischacker&#039;s philosophy makes much more sense to me than the lebensphilosophie and vitalism we find in the work of Green and Fishbane .]]></description>
