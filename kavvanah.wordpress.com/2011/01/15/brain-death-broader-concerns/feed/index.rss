					<description><![CDATA[From a Jewish perspective, I think that there are two major points.  The first is a coherent halachic position on the subject which seems to fall into two camps.  1) is that brain death equals death, 2) is that only cardiac death equals death and brain death does not necessarily equal death.  It is hard to accept elu v&#039; elu on something as fraught as this but it seems possible that the donator can rely on their posek, at least in theory.  

The second issue is much more difficult.  It is the extent to which a brain dead jewish person or family refusing to donate an organ because they believe that brain death does not equal death would be encouraged to accept an organ from a non-jewish person because of the admonition to save life.  The curious logic behind this idea is that since Jewish law does not apply to non-jews, they may choose to donate or not at the point of brain death.  Needless to say this raises the monstrous possibility that Jews will be receiving organs when they believe the practice to be equivalent to murder or at least improper death.  It is indeed not possible to adopt such a position in a modern society without serious potential damage.

Hopefully one of the readers can give some insights on this particular conundrum.]]></description>
