					<description><![CDATA[There are two translations  of The Brothers Ashkenazi, an older one by Maurice Samuel and a newer one by Singer&#039;s son.The newer one is slightly abridged. Someone  ought to compare the two translations. I remember reading  one very interesting chapter in the Samuel translation  where a revolutionary is being interrogated by a member the police. It is missing from the newer translation. 
I enjoyed reading the novel very much, but agree with Avakes that its unremitting negative outlook  is a serious artistic blemish. Buddenbrook&#039;s, it&#039;s not.]]></description>
