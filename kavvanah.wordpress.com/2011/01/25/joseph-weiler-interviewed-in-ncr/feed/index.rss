I just meant that both sides are doing two irreconcilable things and both a religious truths or imperatives. Its just the same kind of game. Sorry if it does not address the deeper issues of Weiler&#039;s exegesis.]]></description>

Chakira, This shiur isn&#039;t about prophecy after the last of the biblical prophets.  It&#039;s about dealing with error in halakhic decisions and za-kein mamrei.
How do you see it as being relevant?

Alan: When I hear  &#039;Shu&quot;t min ha-shamayim&quot;, I associate to cases of Bat Kol, as in &quot;tanoor shel akhnai&quot;.  Is there something in your sources about prophecy past the time of the last biblical prophets?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I thought that the existence of prophecy in Israel concluded with the Anshei K’nesset Ha-g’dola&lt;/em&gt;
Len- There is a detailed introduction on later prophecy and halakhah in R. Margaliot, She&#039;elot u-Teshuvot min ha-Shamayim (1957); Ta Shema, On Shut Min Hashamayim, Tarbitz 57 (1988). Rav Kook discusses shut min hashamayim in his halakhic work. From other perspectives, see Heschel, Heavenly Torah, Moshe Idel has some articles about medieval Jewish prophets and Yuval Cherlow in his Torat E&quot;Y has in the followers of Rav Kook. These articles have the sources. 

chakira- do you have the source?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a fascinating interview.

It seems that he hinges his argument of Jesus being rightly convicted as a false prophet based on the phrase &quot;o-tote u&#039;mofe-sim&quot; being code words for &quot;sent by God&quot; (i.e., a true prophet of God).  And then he cites the Baal Ha-Turim as a source supporting that conclusion.

I thought that the existence of prophecy in Israel concluded with the Anshei K&#039;nesset Ha-g&#039;dola (the Great Assembly) around the time of Ezra (around 500 BCE), after the end of the Babylonian exile.

Does anyone have any more insight into Weiler&#039;s reasoning?

Does anyone have the supporting citation from the Baal Ha-Turim?]]></description>
