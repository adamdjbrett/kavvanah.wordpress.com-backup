				<p>I just submitted my overdue <a href="../../../../2009/09/22/maharal-at-huc-and-beyond/index.html">Maharal paper from the 2009 conference</a> and now continue on my examination of <a href="../../../../2010/12/27/religion-and-popular-culture-rescripting-the-sacred/index.html">popular culture. </a> and <a href="../../11/more-on-the-rock-and-roll-shabbaton/index.html">rock and roll Orthodoxy.</a></p>
<p>1] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Border-Crossings-Christian-Trespasses-Popular/dp/1587430037">Rodney Clapp&#8217;s &#8216;Border Crossings</a> affirms that and that  forays into other areas of public culture (across &#8220;borders&#8221;) should be undertaken first and foremost as Christians. Popular culture has gone mainstream in the US and religion has been swept up into popular culture  American evangelicals have got to stop being so rational and seemingly intellectual, it wont reach anyone. It assumes people we disagree with are “benighted or ill-intentioned.&#8221; He says the plan of identifying with American culture leaves no alternative if it fails. Clapp instead wants greater emphasis on community and worship and less on individual belief or individual practice.<br />
What about the future? Clapp wants greater involvement in culture but as religious people.What does a film or jazz piece teach? How does it help our journey? </p>
<p><strong>Any thoughts on the application of this to orthodoxy?</strong> It seems higher education as in Mada is opposed to Torah, but popular culture seems to be synthesized well with Torah. Can we make any of Torah as counter popular culture? </p>
<blockquote><p>Rodney Clapp&#8217;s &#8216;Border Crossings&#8217; says that everything evangelicals think they know about American culture is wrong.<br />
For this baby boomer, it&#8217;s jarring, and a little unsettling, to see Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s &#8220;Voodoo Child, Part II&#8221; being used to sell a truck. Wasn&#8217;t rock and roll&#8211;at least the good stuff&#8211;supposed to be about maintaining a critical distance from corruptive influences such as the marketplace?<br />
American evangelicalism (specifically, the white suburban variety) is even more captive in this regard than is the music of Hendrix.<br />
Christians should work at being an alternative to the &#8220;technologically-oriented&#8221; and &#8220;consumer-based&#8221; mainstream culture.</p>
<p>According to Clapp, evangelicals believe that Christian truths are &#8220;available to rationally able, well-intended individuals quite apart from any particular tradition or social context.&#8221; It may be hard to believe in our post-&#8220;Inherit the Wind&#8221; world, but evangelical faith is indeed dominated by a kind of rationalism, which says that the content of evangelical faith is expressed in propositions supposedly accessible to any &#8220;well-intended individual.&#8221; The Bible is a sort of instruction manual, albeit one sometimes more difficult to interpret than what comes with Ikea furniture.</p>
<p>Clapp is saying that almost everything American evangelicals know about relating to their non-evangelical contemporaries is wrong, or at least outdated. Other Americans share neither their spiritual aspirations nor their moral reasoning. Sticking to the &#8220;foundationalist&#8221; script is not only unproductive, it&#8217;s counterproductive. Why? Because in addition to assuming something about your interlocutor that isn&#8217;t true, it &#8220;inclines us towards believing that those who disagree are necessarily benighted or ill-intentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evangelical faith places huge emphasis on the individual and the idea of a personal relationship with God. And the less said about liturgy, the better.<br />
With no real sense of what it means to be the church&#8211;what Christians call an ecclesiology&#8211;evangelicals depend on being American&#8211;and Americans being Christian&#8211;as their sole source of a corporate identity. Little wonder so much of the &#8220;religious right&#8217;s&#8221; rhetoric is characterized by fear and sense of crisis. There&#8217;s no plan &#8220;B.&#8221;<br />

<p>2] Another Book on the topic- this one argues that youth leaders should strive for something deeper than entertainment.<br />
In <a href="http://www.congregationalresources.org/growing-souls-experiments-contemplative-youth-ministry">Growing Souls Mark Yaconelli </a>reaches beyond <strong>the tendency for youth pastors to make ministry to adolescents an exercise in entertainment.</strong> He believes both adolescents and those who work with them are longing for &#8220;deeper, more authentic forms of … discipleship&#8221; but that traditional approaches don&#8217;t cultivate this</p>
<p>3] Finally, I wish to discuss the SNL sketch from last night.<br />
The sketch opened and closed with a nice shot of Park East Synagogue. The sketch itself made fun of the 1980’s Bar Mizvah’s that were all Bar and no Torah. Garish Bar Mitzvah’s of entertainment, hiring Hollywood stars, sports figures,  rock musicians, wild themes and high budgets. Nick Kroll, better known as the caveman of Geico commercials,  helped produce a humorous documentary book on the topic a few years ago, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bar-Mitzvah-Disco-Stopped-Partys/dp/1400080444">Bar Mizvah Disco.</a></p>
<p>25 years later these bar mizvah&#8217;s seems not religious, garish and devoid of Torah and spirituality- everything that made people leave their suburban and predominately Conservative congregations. But at the same time, these events kept people in the synagogue, they served to show the relevance of Judaism.If people were into ostentatious wealth, then they found a way to keep it in the synagogue.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/fashion/sundaystyles/23BAR.html">NYT wrote about the book</a> in 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>During this period, Mr. Neuman said, &#8220;the country clubs that used to not want to have us as members want us as members.&#8221; So the proud new members of the Cadillac-driving gentry began organizing religious ceremonies around &#8220;enduring American themes,&#8221; he continued..&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Part of the move to the suburbs is seen as a step to being more integrated with your non-Jewish neighbors,&#8221; Dr. Shandler said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a family celebration. It becomes a kind of mega birthday party. Parents are using this as a social occasion, so their business associates and neighbors get invited to the celebration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now to what I really want to ask. Here is the SNL clip making fun of one of these Bar-Mitzvah. The father in the skit says that we do tis because we can afford it and to entertain the guests. Meaning that they see that Jews don’t have to be excluded, they can have everything in popular culture.  <strong>How is this different than a Rock and Roll Shabbaton? In both there are rock performers instead of Torah. If you answer kiruv and getting people into shul, I can say the same thing about the 1980’s bar mitzvah. People wanted to be part of these suburban Jewish centers because it allowed to do the things that interested them. Both assumed that once in the door the rabbi would teach them more about Judaism. So what is the difference?</strong></p>

				<p>Today&#8217;s NYT had a nice piece about an Orthodox Dance Ensemble just for men.  You can go to their <a href="http://www.othermove.com/?lat=en">Ka&#8217;et website</a> to find out their bios and pieces they perform as well as the schedule of courses.  <a href="http://ko-kr.connect.facebook.com/pages/Kaet-Ensemble-nsmbl-kt/152254648158622">Facebook page of Ka&#8217;et</a> Israeli Religious Zionists have created a film school and teach film and poetry in their high schools, here is another element for them to create a rich expressionistic religious life. This are the types of arts which American Orthodoxy lacks. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/arts/dance/16kaet.html">Whirling Along The Borders Of Israeli Life By JANICE ROSS</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the epitome of this effort is Ka’et, a group of five Orthodox men working under the direction of a Tel Aviv choreographer, Ronen Izhaki. Together they create spare yet emotionally rich work that takes gestures from daily prayer movements along with chants and synagogue attire, and gently shifts and reframes these elements as postmodern dance. It’s a savvy move, reflecting both the explosive body of Ohad Naharin’s choreography and its social opposite, the trancelike swaying of devout Jews in deep prayer. “We are using the stage to awaken a new discussion between our lives and our bodies,” said Amitai Stern, 25, the youngest member of the group.</p>
<p>The men of Ka’et (a Hebrew acronym that means “timely”) are not professional dancers. In their 20s and 30s, some have families; all have day jobs — one is a rabbi at a yeshiva, another works with runaways from ultra-Orthodox homes. But when they made their debut in the fall at the Lab, an important alternative space in Jerusalem, and afterward in sold-out concerts elsewhere, their lack of performing experience didn’t matter. They presented an astonishingly intense dance, “Highway No. 1,” with movement, costumes and sound score taken from Jewish religious practice.</p>
<p>Starting with Emmanuel Witzthum’s techno music overlaid with chanted Kabbalah passages, the dance revealed prayer as not just its medium but also its subject. The men, barefoot and wearing worn slacks and shirts, sway softly, palms forward, eyes rolled back, lips moving noiselessly. Suddenly one begins accelerating his movements. With growing agitation he tries to climb over the others clustered around him — like a sleepwalker driven by a disturbing dream. The ensemble responds reflexively, folding his swimming arms down to his sides and pressing him back into a posture of quiet prayer without breaking the steady rocking motions of their own davening.</p>
<p>When a group of religious men from Mr. Izhaki’s dance school saw a performance, several chuckled out loud at this passage. “It reminds me exactly of when I am praying and an errant thought keeps trying to interrupt me,” one of them, Yuval Azulay, said. “You try to put it aside and get back to the focus of the prayer, but it keeps coming back.”</p>
<p>“Highway No. 1” takes its title from the road connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, which epitomize the secular and religious in Israel. “If you work in Jerusalem with religious people, you are right wing,” Mr. Izhaki, 38, said. “And if you live in Tel Aviv and are a dancer, you are left wing and a vegetarian. But I didn’t take the package with either of those.”</p>
<p>The men’s ability to draw religious and secular Israelis into the same theater for a dance performance is highly unusual. Alon Ben-Yaacov, a tour guide and the one member of Ka’et who wears long payos, the side curls of Orthodox Jews, said it took three years for his family members to understand that he wanted to dance, but now, he said, they are supportive.<br />
Hananya Schwartz, the young rabbi in Ka’et, was anxious about his own rabbi’s seeing him dance onstage. His anxiety wasn’t entirely misplaced: after the performance, his rabbi quoted a passage from the Talmud that Mr. Schwartz said could be summed up as “interesting but you are wasting your time.”</p>
<p> &#8230; and all of the men said they were looking for a way to teach movement in yeshivas and religious centers.<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>For the last few months,  I have been thinking about how to organize the material coming into my feed about brain death. My most basic comment is to point out that the Catholic Church is also busy defining the time of death. After the Terry Schiavo case, they realize that they did not have clear enough decisions. So in 2008-2010, there have been speeches, documents and Catholic policy papers on brain death. Catholic run hospitals are the largest group of hospitals in the US. The question is whether they will adopt a theory of human nature approach or a casuistry approach for the final documents.</p>
<p>Another set of documents relates to the changes in the President’s Commission on Bioethics, there have been major changes from the <a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/">Bush commission </a>to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-4-7-10">Obama commission.</a> (You can read the papers and transcripts <a href="http://www.bioethics.gov/transcripts/">here</a> and <a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/transcripttopic.html">here.</a>) But also the change from clergy as bioethicists to professional bioethicists and now a majority are physicians and scientists. Pay attention when you a read a statement if it is by a scientist, a clergy acting as a scientist, or a clergy speaking from religion. Also pay attention if the new clergy statements are following Bush or Obama President’s Commission on Bioethics guidelines and visions. In this set of documents, I also should mention the Congressional debates over end-of life panels.</p>
<p>The current perspective for those in theology, hospice, or those wanted to give a religious meaning to death is return to a deathbed and a natural acceptance of death. People feel there has been too much medical intervention in our lives. <a href="../../../../2010/06/08/paul-griffiths-on-death/index.html">Here is a prior post on the topic</a> with two thoughtful comments.</p>
<p>These debates about the definition of end of life have bothered moderns for 250 years already. 19<sup>th</sup> century Europeans projected their anxiety of burying still alive people onto vampire stories and tales from the crypt. The famous Schwerin debate between Mendelssohn and Emden was over end of life, Mendelssohn claiming that someone can still be alive in coma and life takes precedent over burial customs.  </p>
<p>Post WWII Twentieth Century thinking tended to be infatuated with medicine and trusted the doctor; there are several excellent books on that topic. Now there is a greater skepticism toward physicians as deciding the big question of end of life. Whichever way the brain death issues of 2008-2012  get settled, it is only for a few decades. Know that the question will most likely be opened up at least twice more within the next hundred years. </p>
<p>American newspapers set this as a personal choice and do not usually reflect on the complex weave created by a religious affiliation hospital, and the religious affiliations of the doctors and nurses in the mix. The Catholics involved in health care that I know are familiar with the writings of Fred Rosner and the Jews are familiar with Catholic Bishops statements.</p>
<p>So I was delighted when I was saved the trouble of organizing my links by the post last Thursday by Religion Link, a service that gives resources for papers to write articles on religion. Many papers take the bait and in three weeks one can compare how various papers covered the same religion story from the same sources.  I will give selections from a <a href="http://www.religionlink.com/tip_110114.php">much longer Religion Link post.</a> As you can see, the post gives lots of great links.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://www.religionlink.com/tip_110114.php">Defining brain death and sparking a health care debate</a></strong><br />
Posted on January 12th, 2011</p>
<p>The Obama administration’s decision to halt regulations authorizing end-of-life counseling through Medicare once again shows how politically fraught the issue can be in the wake of the health care reform controversy over so-called death panels. But knotty issues remain for ethicists and religious groups on what constitutes brain death and the end of life.</p>
<p>The renewed debate can be traced to technological advances and new brain research, and also to questions being raised by believers, particularly in Catholicism and Judaism.</p>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI and Vatican officials have in <a href="http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/209766?eng=y" target="_blank">recent years questioned</a> whether “brain death” is an adequate marker to determine biological death.</p>
<p>Caring for people in the final stages of life is one of the most expensive aspects of the nation’s health care system, accounting for as much as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69C3KY20101014" target="_blank">one-third of all health care costs</a>, and about 30 percent of Medicare expenditures come in the last year of a patient’s life. Moreover, modern medicine is able to keep human beings — or at least their bodies — alive for increasingly long periods, often in what is known as a “persistent vegetative state,” or PVS.</p>
<p>This comes as the nation’s population continues to grow grayer, with the responsibility of providing for the terminally ill falling on the next generation, and on strained state and federal budgets.</p>
<p>Americans last engaged in widespread public discussion about the emotional topic of people in a “persistent vegetative state” in 2005, during the protracted and acrimonious national debate over the fate of Terri Schiavo.</p>
<p>At that time, Schiavo’s husband, Michael Schiavo, decided to remove the feeding tube that had kept the severely brain-injured woman alive — though unconscious and unresponsive –- for 15 years. Her parents strongly objected and took legal action to prevent the move. Michael prevailed after weeks of rancorous dispute that eventually involved national politicians as well as religious figures, ethical experts and, ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court. Points of contention included whether and how Terri Schiavo had expressed her desires about her situation, whether her condition justified steps that would have the effect of ending her life, and who had the right to decide. The recent developments in medical technology and ethics involve each of these issues.</p>
<p>In the brain imaging study published in February 2010, British and Belgian researchers reported on studies of 54 persistently unconscious individuals. In five of these people, a brain-imaging machine revealed particular patterns of brain activity that occurred after researchers asked “yes” or “no” questions to the patients. “A small proportion of patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state have brain activation reflecting some awareness and cognition,” the article states. The technique “may be useful in establishing basic communication with patients who appear to be unresponsive.” But an editorial in the Journal cautioned families of brain-injured patients against taking from these results any unfounded hope that the patients with severe brain injuries can improve.</p>
<p>In November 2009, the nation’s Catholic bishops issued new guidelines on care of terminally ill patients in Catholic hospitals that tightened standards to prevent the actions taken in Schiavo’s case from occurring in institutions under church control. The new policies would make refusal or removal of feeding tubes and some other life-sustaining measures more difficult and, many observers believe, conflict with the desires — and even the legally valid directives — of some patients to have such measures ended or never begun. “In principle, there is an obligation to provide patients with food and water, including medically assisted nutrition and hydration for those who cannot take food orally,” states the document, Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. “This obligation extends to patients in chronic and presumably irreversible conditions (e.g., the “persistent vegetative state”) who can reasonably be expected to live indefinitely if given such care.”</p>
<p>These standards, however, differ sharply from the general practices of American hospitals, which permit end-of-life decisions that include withholding of nutrition and hydration if such comports with the express wish of the patient. Observers therefore predict the probability of conflict between the new guidance and the desires and decisions of many dying individuals and their families.</p>
<ul>
<li>The      University of Miami’s second Global Business Forum, held Jan. 12-14, 2011,      explored <a href="http://www.bus.miami.edu/events/gbf2011/index.html" target="_blank">“The Business of Health Care: Defining the Future”</a> and      included a panel titled “Care Models, Economics and Ethics of End of Life      Decision Making.”</li>
<li>On Jan. 6,      2011, the Obama administration <a href="http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/01/obama_admin_rev.html" target="_blank">reversed course</a> on end-of-life counseling regulations      due to concerns that they would revive the “death panels” controversy.</li>
<li>Research <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0905370" target="_blank">reported      in the February 2010 edition</a> of <em>The New England Journal of      Medicine</em> indicates that some individuals with brain damage      previously thought to prevent thought, consciousness and communication in      fact possess previously unsuspected levels of awareness. Even if aided by      advanced technology, they have the ability to answer questions accurately.      Experts caution that this dealt with a small percentage of patients in PVS      and that hopes for a recovery for these patients were vanishingly small.</li>
<li>In      November 2009 the Catholic bishops of the United States issued guidance to      Catholic hospitals banning the removal of nutrition and hydration from      patients who would survive if they were provided. That has raised concerns      that advance directives could be ignored in Catholic hospitals if they      conflict with Catholic policies. There are more than 600 Catholic medical      facilities in the United States, the largest single private provider of      health care in the country.</li>
<li>Catholic      teaching on the definition of death and the ethics of organ harvesting      appears to be in flux. In the latter half of 2008 the issue came to the      fore when <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804529.htm" target="_blank">the Vatican newspaper</a> published a front-page column      calling for a re-examination of the definition of brain death. Subsequently,      Pope Benedict XVI delivered <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4A658820081107" target="_blank">an      address</a> to a Vatican conference on organ donation in which he said      that “where certainty has not been reached the principle of precaution must      prevail.”</li>
<li>In October      2009, <em>Nature</em> magazine published <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7264/full/461570a.html" target="_blank">an editorial</a> calling for a “realistic definition of      life’s end” in order to facilitate the harvesting and donation of organs,      among other things. The editorial sums up the current laws and policies      and the state of the debate.</li>

				<p>I tend to get the most readers/comments when it snows locally. So check back here over the next days. For those looking for my <a href="../../../../2010/01/25/tu-bshevat-seder-with-text/index.html">Tu b&#8217;Shevat Seder post from last year, here it is.</a></p>
<p>This should not be taken as a critique the rabbi or the rock shabbaton. Rather since this will be setting the tone for OU synagogues, let’s understand it now. I will have several upcoming posts on the connection of these trends in Orthodoxy with the new “Emerging Church” “Café Church” and “Next Level Church.” </p>
<p>This post is a continuation of <a href="../../../../2010/12/26/cruise-ship-synagogues-for-orthodoxy/index.html">Cruise Ship Synagogues for Orthodoxy,</a> which generated interesting comments.</p>
<p>First, Daltry will be presented with an award at the Shabbaton.</p>
<blockquote><p>ROGER DALTREY. This larger than life figure is being honored by our synagogue for his countless contributions to charities around the world. He will be the recipient of WSIS&#8217;s first annual Tikkun Olam Award. Roger has been at the forefront of the battle against teen addiction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, as presented to the elderly readers of the Jewish Week about this experiment in the future of Modern Orthodoxy.</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8220;Tommy&#8221; singer will discuss &#8220;what it&#8217;s like to be him, his connection to Jewish people and his charity work,&#8221; said the congregation&#8217;s president, Andrew Fox&#8230; Fox, 43, said the &#8220;Rock and Roll Shabbaton&#8221; is part of the shul&#8217;s <strong>&#8220;experiment on what modern Orthodoxy is going to become.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Third, Rabbi Einhorn was interviewed on Zev Brenner – <a href="http://talklinecommunications.com/broadcasts/?p=episode&amp;name=2011-01-09_talkline_010911_shlomo_einhorn_wsis_and_gary_goldstein.mp3">link was provided by an anon commenter. </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Rabbi declared that he had an expansive <em>Eyn od Milvado</em> “There is nothing but God or there is no ultimate source but God” (Eyn od milvado-literally &#8220;there is none other than God&#8221;) approach. God can be found everywhere.<br />
He said that such a program gives Hizzuk  because it shows that non Jewish have great respect and love for Judaism. If they did not have this respect then they would not be speaking in a shul</p>
<p>Zev Brenner  pondered out loud about our use of Winnie the Pooh menorahs or Mickey Mouse Menorahs. Do we use pop-culture to be hip?</p>
<p>Rabbi Einhorn explained that these programs serve as an entry point to Jewish life for many people, they serve as a  bridge between where people are and the synagogue.  We encourage a &#8220;total celebration of Judaism.” </p>
<p>Brenner: Where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>Rabbi- We draw the line only if we find someone who values are antithetical to Judaism.<br />
[site editor- he was asked this 4 times in the course of the interview from both Brenner and audience. In each case he avoided the issue that few bands stand for sex, drugs, and rebellion as do the Who. ]</p>
<p>[I skipped the phone questions that wanted to discuss Rock trivia.]</p>
<p>Phone-In question- Do we need to go to Rock and Roll, does it show we are lacking? And the Who is certainly against Jewish values, one of the members is even charged with child molestation.</p>
<p>Rabbi- We have to make decisions with all tunes that we use and with the decoration and styles of shuls. In each case, we have to decide just how far and how much. Our shul does not turn to rock instead of gedolim, in fact we have have more gedolim than any other shul. We have had the Moditzer  Rebbe, the Nikelsburger Rebbe et al. Our shul promotes gedolim. [The list of gedolim is interesting as well as the choice of the word “promote.”]</p>
<p>Question from Brenner- what is the use-function of a shul?<br />
Rabbi’s Answer- You have to experience to understand how it brings hizzuk.<br />
When I teach about the angels going up and down above Yakov avinu, I use Stairway to Heaven- it is a mashol!<br />
Everyone has things from the outside world – Our difference from the Haredim is only how and where it comes in There is wisdom among the goyim so we try to pick up the best.<br />
These approach is  not pulling someone out of shtibl but our congregants are already immersed in rock and roll.</p>
<p>Zev Brenner – The moral life of rock stars is not recommended. How can you bring them? What are they showing?</p>
<p>Rabbi Einhorn- “He wont bring in anyone who is against Torah values.” Elan Atias &#8211; Lead Singer of Bob Marley has started to put on tefilin everyday.  Ellen Foley – davens at Jewish center and is rediscovering her connection to yiddishkeit. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong><br />
There is limited time for programming and a house of worship does take on the character of the programs.<br />
When Centrism started with Medical Ethics, Business Ethics and politics, it produced congregations of upper middle class professionals active in Israeli politics. Those with other interests did go elsewhere.  What wil this produce over time?</p>
<p>Shul life programs like the men’s club cater to those already members, but outreach program’s that are not part of the shul life create a consumer ethos like Aish Hatorah. Most of Aish’s attendees belong to Reform Temples and they come for the Aish programming. Even if they change denominational affiliation, this outreach will create an Orthodox synagogue of non-observant or not totally observant congregants.  </p>
<p>Will phrases like &#8220;eyn od milvado&#8221; and &#8220;total celebration of Judaism&#8221; replace the halakhic terminology?</p>
<p>Finally, in what way is this a hizzuk? A hizzzuk of what? Jewish pride in what?</p>

				<p>Review of New Book by Shmuel Feiner on the tension between Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. This book focuses on middle positions- Religious haskalah, nationalist theists, enlightened Hasidism- each seeking a third way between Orthodoxy and Enlightenment. Feiner highlights observant maskilim -Shadal, Rashi Fuenn,  Eliezer Zweifel. They are invested with maintaining of Jewish national consciousness that was not Zionist, or assimilationist (contrasted with Kovner or ILGordon).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/culture/books/jewish-history-maskilim-miracles-and-modernization-1.336029">Milhemet Tarbut</a> (Kulturkampf: The Jewish Enlightenment in the 19th Century‏), by Shmuel Feiner.</strong> Carmel Publishing House (Hebrew), 387 pages, NIS 96</p>
<blockquote><p>
The word “kulturkampf,” or culture war, has been tossed around a lot lately, and has turned into such a cliche ..A culture war is not just any conflict that takes place between people with different opinions, or even people with different lifestyles, but is, rather, a battle over the fundamental nature of life.</p>
<p>Shmuel Feiner illustrates that belligerence at the beginning of “Kulturkampf: The Jewish Enlightenment in the 19th Century.” He describes how a rabbi in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, forced a young maskil ‏(a follower of the Jewish Enlightenment‏) to divorce his wife because “forbidden” books – nontraditional books that dealt with “modern” issues – were found in his satchel.</p>
<p>All the while, he tells us about the various and sometimes conflicted parts of the whole: “The tensions and the many splits that were caused by the enemies of the Haskalah during the course of the 19th century, the counter-Haskalah, the moderate Haskalah, the radical Haskalah, the religious Haskalah, the anti-clerical Haskalah, the false Haskalah, the nationalist Haskalah and finally, the post-Haskalah.”</p>
<p>The period of expansion ended, in Feiner’s opinion, in 1824, with the publication of an issue of the Jewish weekly Hatzfira that espoused a more radical modernization than the Eastern European maskilim had been advocating. Four years later, Isaac Ber Levinsohn published “Teudah Beyisrael,” in which he demanded that the Jews of Russia undergo cultural and economic changes by adopting modern education, speaking the Russian language, and turning to the trades and agriculture instead of mid-sized and petty commerce.</p>
<p>But the most important step Levinsohn took was to request a monetary grant from the Russian authorities. Within the Jewish community, writes Feiner, this “defined the place of the maskil as an ally of the government,” since the changes he suggested were favored by the Russian government at the time.</p>
<p>At the same time, the maskilim generally described “the new era” as an unprecedented period that God himself had granted to mankind, including the Jews, if only they would accept the fact that the new era was a manmade change that was taking place within history rather than outside of it.</p>
<p>The reaction of the Orthodox establishment was, of course, very negative. It saw the new era “as a crisis and a threat, as though the very awareness of Jewish survival in exile was gradually disappearing, and with it the expectation of redemption.”</p>
<p>The result was that the controversy over the Enlightenment seemed to become “a battle between faith and heresy,” a viewpoint that prevails to this day among a large part of the Orthodox establishment. The historical truth, notes Feiner, was different: Few, if any, of the maskilim could be considered atheists, and only a few of the most radical maskilim might be considered deists, meaning that they believed in the existence of a primordial power but did not believe that such an entity intervenes in the day-to-day functioning of the world – thus rejecting such concepts as miracles, redemption and the role of divine providence in individual lives.</p>
<p>The polarization between the two camps was clearly described by someone who adhered to Orthodox belief but had one foot in the Haskalah camp: Samuel David Luzzatto, a man of contrasts who after a nighttime discussion with a young intellectual in Padua wrote an article that begins with the sentence: “World civilization at this time is a result of two different foundations: Ethicism and Judaism.” Feiner devotes a chapter to Luzzatto that deals with the counter-Enlightenment, and writes that it can be seen as one of the early signs of “the historical trend of the formation of a modern national consciousness in light of the challenges of modernism.”</p>
<p>Feiner depicts Eliezer Zweifel, who “dared to question the branding of Hasidism as an enemy reflecting everything against which the Haskalah was fighting,” as the founder and representative of this group. Zweifel was aware of the weakening of collective Jewish identity in Europe and observed two ways to strengthen it: the literature created by the moderate maskilim, which preserved the spirit of the nation “like an iron wall of Jewish identity that separates Israel from the other nations,” and “the path of the members of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, who take care of the actual physical survival of the Jewish people.”</p>
<p>Zweifel considered the success of Hasidism and the large number of admirers of the Ba’al Shem Tov, “a fact that obligates the maskilim to free themselves of prejudices and anti-Hasidic images,” and rejected the portrayal of Hasidism as representing the opposite of rational wisdom.</p>
<p>“Zweifel integrated Hasidism into a complex historical scheme of Jewish development,” writes Feiner. He rejects the idea that Zweifel “gave up at the height of a kulturkampf against Hasidism” and notes that he did harshly criticize the Hasidim of his time, going so far as to ask Hasidic leaders to change Hasidism based on “ten pieces of good advice” that he thought would pave the way to an end of the kulturkampf.<br />
The Hasidic leaders, of course, did not agree to the changes, but Zweifel did succeed in raising the possibility of a “third path” that remains available to contemporary Jews: a moderate and harmonious Haskalah that would preserve “improved Hasidism” as a spiritual asset.</p>
<p>Feiner attributes another attempt to stop the kulturkampf to Samuel Joseph Finn, a moderate maskil who called the battle between Orthodoxy and Haskalah “the war of knowledge.” Feiner calls Finn’s philosophy “religious Haskalah,” which was expressed mainly in Finn’s involvement in the establishment of the rabbinical school in Vilna, which opened in 1847. </p>
<p>In contrast to Finn, Feiner brings the message of the radical Haskalah in Russia as expressed by Isaac Eisik Kovner, who harshly criticized the Jewish lifestyle in that country. But Kovner, who wrote “Sefer Hamatsref” and who was one of the first of the Russian maskilim to identify the existence of “false maskilim” ‏(assimilationists‏), remained on the margins of the maskil experience. Unlike Finn, another native of his city, Vilna, Yehuda Leib Gordon, was very influential. Gordon, who introduced the expression “kulturkampf” in its original German into the maskilic discourse, is described by Feiner as having been influenced by the anti-clerical wave that swept through several European countries during the last third of the 19th century. </p>
<p>In this spirit, Gordon demanded that control over education and various political functions be taken away from the Orthodox establishment.  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/culture/books/jewish-history-maskilim-miracles-and-modernization-1.336029c">read Full version here-</a> 3k of words with reviewers own political application of the book for today&#8217;s problems.</p></blockquote>

by Micah Goodman. Dvir Publishing House ‏(Hebrew), 383 pages, 92 NIS</p>
<p>Dr. Micah Goodman, a rising star in the field of Jewish thought, has something new to say. He thinks that perplexity is, indeed, one of the fundamental elements of the “Guide for the Perplexed.” …</p>
<p>The Rambam’s work promised to be a guide that would enable one to bypass both popular folk religion and atheism, and to build a narrow bridge over doubt.</p>
<p>The book begins with a presentation of the crucial problem of faith in a transcendent God. Such a removed God presents “the greatest threat to religion,” says the author; the solution he offers is that Maimonides had as his goal the creation of a new hero of faith; and <strong>faith in God is not a matter of passive waiting, but rather a function of human initiative, a heroic undertaking in which man creates his own personality.</strong> In the same way, redemption is seen not as the result of miraculous intervention that transpires as a result of divine beneficence, but rather is a natural result of man’s striving, his commitment of all his resources to the search for God. Redemption is a natural process in which the redeemed is also the redeemer.</p>
<p>“Guide for the Perplexed” leads the reader to a Socratic conundrum in which a person knows that he does not know, yet does not give up on the possibility of knowledge. Despair about great ideologies, which comes to us courtesy of postmodernism, derives from a loss of the possibility of knowledge, which is also the possibility of doubt. In Goodman’s view, this despair can be converted into an enabling form of perplexity. </p>
<p>As the author sees it, there is no contrast between revelation and wisdom, since wisdom is that which has been revealed. And what about the Torah? In the book’s second part, after reviewing analogies between the Torah and nature,<strong> the author interprets Maimonides as implying that the Torah is divine, but not written by God. Moses observed nature scrupulously and wrote the Torah, and since nature required the existence of God, the Torah has to be divine.</strong></p>
<p>It is in its third part that the book reaches its pinnacle, as it presents a discussion of the concept of perplexity that distinguishes between forms of confusion and identifies a form of redemptive perplexity, <strong>enabling us to keep a distance from the cult of reason and from the paralyzing authority of tradition;</strong> this state of perplexity propels an individual on a journey of self-growth. Influenced by the late philosopher Shlomo Pines, Goodman suggests that the aim of this journey is to identify the limits of knowledge and allow elements of mystery to enter an individual’s spiritual life. A fulfilling intellectual life brings wonder into an individual’s existence. This is a life in which the individual does not view himself as the center; it is life lived in the constant awareness of mystery.</p>
<p>The concept of an individual who creates his own personality has about it an air of existential analysis, but we should be wary of attributing an atheistic form of existentialism to Goodman’s text… nor does the analysis depend upon a Lurianic kabbalistic view of divine contraction in order to provide room for individual autonomy. “On the contrary,” writes Goodman. “The huge majesty of God is what frees the world from its dependence on [God], and provides free space for individual creativity.”</p>
<p>We thus face an interesting question: <strong>To what extent is this theological idea that an individual’s self-realization renders him closer to God akin to everyday popular metaphors about “the creation of personality”? </strong>To what extent is the presumably secular idea of self-realization consistent with the religious idea maintaining there is only one way of heeding an absolute commandment? It is on this level, I believe, that the allure of secularism needs to be compared with the allure of Maimonides.</p>
<p>The natural situation of the human being, before sin, is one of closeness. From the moment that sin, materialism and the expulsion from Eden are created, distance comes into being. Thus the differences between the doctrine of tzimtzum, or divine contraction, promulgated by Rabbi Yitzhak Luria and that espoused by the Rambam are minor, because this doctrine sees the need to explain how there can be places where God is only partially present.<br />
