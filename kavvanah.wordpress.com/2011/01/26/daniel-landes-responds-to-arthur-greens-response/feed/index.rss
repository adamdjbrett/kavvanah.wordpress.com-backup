					<description><![CDATA[The discussion is foolish if it&#039;s any more than academic. Why do we continue to speak about God as if we were describing an existence that has the reality of a natural entity? What God are we talking about: the one proven by the cosmological argument? the ontological argument? the argument from design? the teleological argument? etc, etc. Better to be a truly radical mystic and say nothing about the divine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; the indispensability of law in curbing human temptation.

Now that would be an interesting topic for a real discussion... preferably by people who have been paying attention to the actual practice of &quot;halachic&quot; Judaism, as opposed to the idealized 1970s discourse so beloved by &quot;pluralist&quot; Orthodox Jews.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are, I think, too quick to take offense.  Landes did not &quot;call Green unsophisticated.&quot;  Rather, he said in passing that a rhetorical image chosen by Green was not scientifically well-founded.  Landes may be right or wrong but he was not displaying &quot;nerve.&quot;  To the contrary, the tone of his response seemed quite conciliatory.  Thanks for flagging this interesting exchange.]]></description>
