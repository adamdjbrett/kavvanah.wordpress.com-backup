					<description><![CDATA[I originally did not mention the book, but it is getting a lot interest, maybe because of his institute.  It does seem to not be interested in history, rather Maimonides for today. (1) I think you are correct that he is on a course of a Rav Soloveitchik-David Hartman reading of Maimonides- when he isn&#039;t differing with it. (2) He works the minimal theology of Tzimzum, Rav Nahman, and doubt into Maimonides. (3) There is a theology of &quot;the potential human&quot; which sounds like part of his institute lectures. (4) He follows a Pines reading of the impossibility of knowledge of God and metaphysics. 
The reviewer Buzaglo is a serious philosopher, but I dont think he has given a complete review. 
I expect several more works on Maimonides, Nahmanides, and Zionism from Goodman in the upcoming years, so start figuring him out now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This isn&#039;t my area at all and I haven&#039;t read the book but....

It is puzzling that a book that according to the review seeks to rescue one from the cult of reason via a seemingly existentialist approach to the self retreats from Kierkegaard in order to resolve the basic tensions of religion by means of a rational approach to revelation which returns revelation to a natural process. To dissolve a key tension between reason and faith seems to sacrifice Kierkegaard&#039;s project at the altar of reason.

Maybe the review is confusing but the book is not.  It does seem (as do many recent attempts at Jewish theology) like a deliberate philosophical mashup that may not work except for those willing to take the author&#039;s word for how to read certain texts and reconcile certain ideas. Maybe there is also something particularly uncompromising about Kierkegaard that makes him a bad candidate for sampling from.

I wish the review did a better job of hinting at how recognizing  the limits of reason frees one from the &quot;paralyzing authority of tradition.&quot; This sounds like an inversion of Soloveitchik. But again, I am probably reading too much into a short review.]]></description>
