					<description><![CDATA[I have the Rav Twersky&#039;s paper, it was sent to me among the other papers.  I think that is why this should not be connected to Neo-hasidism but is something new. I thought his source is the Habakuk usage- &quot;there is one ultimate source to all things&quot; like in the Shivi Keller song. 
P.S. I just found two usages like this from the Kiruv world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tziporahheller.com/one_article.php?id=60&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tzipporah Heller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.targum.com/product.php/251/learn-the-secret&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moshe Goldberger.&lt;/a&gt; (links fixed)
(By the way, please provide email in the future)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Brill- Were you at the Orthodox Forum on Yirat Shamayim when Rabbi Twersky presented his paper (never published) which discussed Ein Od Milvado and Shalom Carmy correctly noted that he is distorting the meaning of Eyn Od Milvado- it actually means that there is no OTHER God, beside Him. It does not mean that God is everything and the only thing. Einhorn is a talmid of Rabbi Twersky, I believe. Funny stuff.]]></description>
