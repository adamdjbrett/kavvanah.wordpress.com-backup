					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;The RR shabbaton is planned as a roundabout spirituality/kiruv event. It may not be your average Aish haTorah event, but it is clearly intentionally structured around getting people in AND feeling something.&lt;/em&gt;

So how is it different than mixed dancing in the 1950&#039;s or marching to protest political embassies int he 1980&#039;s. It is an activity done for people already in the fold and what you are competing for is market share.The word Kiruv is used as magic dust that can turn impure into pure but it is a theological term not a sociological one. Kiruv allows us to say anything can be permitted, any change to the synagogue life can be tolerated, any upturning of the normal hierarchy is allowed. Even if that was Ok for moving people from non-observance to observance, kiruv is now used as a synonym for outreach, synagogue events, community events. Let&#039;s have a BBQ, so now it is called kiruv and not men&#039;s club. Part of the reason is to get the magic dust inversion of categories.
If you are doing kiruv with people who are already floating around Orthodox synagogues or already have day school education, then it is community outreach like offering mixed dancing kept people from jumping ship to the Conservative congregation.
The Evangelicals have the same issues in that all Churches are engaged in mission, but some have made the entertainment and cultural elements to be their core and forgotten that there was an original religious mission. Part of Rick Warren&#039;s success is that he gets you involved after one event, and does not wait until you have been there several years. Our question about rock nRoll shabbos should be the relationship of the entertainment to mainstreaming. Aish has a single digit number who are mainstreamed, most go back to their Reform congregations looking to Aish occasionally as authenticity. If a shul had a single digit observance level then it would not be a success. Aish picks people from Birthright and Rothberg Overseas program and places where they are not observant, this  event  was for people already reading Orthodox shul bulletins, the unaffiliated Orthodox singles of the UWS. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Both assumed that once in the door the rabbi would teach them more about Judaism. So what is the difference?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The jury is obviously still out there on the R&#038;R shabbaton, but I would suggest that the crucial different is in planning and intent. The garish lavish BM parties were celebrations of pure we-got-there-and-can-too. The RR shabbaton is planned as a roundabout spirituality/kiruv event. It may not be your average Aish haTorah event, but it is clearly intentionally structured around getting people in AND feeling something. That targeted emotional component is crucial. What was missing in the 80s BM scene was a plan and tools to move from A to B. That is presumable what the R&#038;R shabbaton organizers feel that they have now began addressing.

Personally, I do feel, however, that the R&#038;R shabbaton is passé before even starting. Any R&#038;R that will make it into the synagogue is likely to be golden oldies, which the young generation never heard. Please correct me if I am wrong here. So, I think that after the novelty wears off, this will only have niche appeal.

I much sooner see social activism coupled with spirituality / meditation attract the young. And it need not be all about post Orthodox/ post Evangelical pet peeves. Judaism has a solid doctrine of fairness and equity. There is so much to do with this, whether in the legislative, in the faith-based social welfare, or in the judicial realms, not to speak of international politics (fighting for the refugees of Drafur was very energizing, and the right thing to do), to keep college students and twenty somethings busy for generations. The question is, once people settle down, in their thirties, does that still atract, and if not, what should they be transitioned to.]]></description>
