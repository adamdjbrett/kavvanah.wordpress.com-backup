					<description><![CDATA[Any particular meta issues that you have in mind? I am developing a thesis on one particular meta issue, but it&#039;s a bit premature to write about it now.

But to touch on a point that relates to my topic and Green&#039;s article, the tenure of Bush&#039;s PCBE saw the rise of two polar extremes of bioethics, the conservative neoLuddites and the transhumanists. Both grasp at science fiction inspired visions of the future one dystopian and one utopian. Neither spent much time dealing with the real pressing issues that arose during the first decade of the 21st century. The result was that a lot of bioethics discourse across the spectrum was caught up in debates over of futuristic scenarios. Depending on how things turn out, t in 100 years it may either be seen as a prophetic dialogue or an extended but rather fruitless thought experiment .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/three-conferences-in-jewish-thought-one-with-mp3s/#comment-2344&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/a&gt;.

If you have something to submit, then do it. The conferences tend to be a mixed bag one can have Leon Kass, Joshua Berman, some Europeans without knowledge of Hebrew, and Eric Nelson (The Hebrew Republic)- all in the same conference. They are what you make of them.There will be popular pieces and specialized pieces.  I have attended in the past. 
Can I get you to do some posts about the meta issues medical ethics?  I wanted to do one on Ronald Green&#039;s article about Bush&#039;s bioethics commission and the change change in Obama&#039;s commission to actual scientists. But I never did it because I dont write on the topic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of conferences: any thoughts about Shalem Center&#039;s 3 year project funded by the Templeton Foundation to rediscover Biblical and early Rabbinic Philosophy? After reading through the various descriptions I&#039;m frankly puzzled by what they are trying to do.  Clearly echoes of Berkovitz, but if they really want to find Talmudic perspective on questions that interest specialized anglo philosophy, this will be of little interest to most people.]]></description>
