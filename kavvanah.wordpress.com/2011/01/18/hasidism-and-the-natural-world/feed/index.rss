					<description><![CDATA[So, i got a source for R. Israel Salanter...alas it is not a very good one...The idea is phrased here quite conservatively but it is still interesting...

Reb Shmuel Salant once told Reb Shabsai a Torah insight that he had heard many years before from his close friend and colleague, Rav Yisrael Shalanter. Rav Yisrael had explained that the divine thoughts that Chanoch put into each stitch of the shoes he sewed were not spiritual meditations. Rather, they were Chanoch’s simple and straightforward intentions that the job he did would be performed properly. He prayed that each and every stitch would be sewn to the best of his ability so that the person who would eventually buy such footwear would receive shoes that were made to last, shoes that were worth every bit of the money they cost. “And Chanoch walked with God” (Bereshis 5:24) means that Chanoch walked according to the Halachah, and made an honest living.

(In Every Generation, 102)

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have the source at the moment, but it was once mentioned to me that the Israel Salanter once said that Enoch&#039;s intention in sewing the shoes  was to make the best pair of shoes possible. I thought this was a very interesting contrast to the usual Hasidic/mystical interpretations given to this anecdote and, in our context, could perhaps be seen as reflecting an interest in the quality or &quot;actuality&quot; of things in regards to nature and society...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m familiar with Ramchal&#039;s K&#039;lach Pitchei Chochma and the only place I remember him speaking about dreams is when cites the fact that the Sephirot can be envisioned, and that they assume dream-like properties when they do. Where does he say teh world itself is a dream?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/hasidism-and-the-natural-world/#comment-2428&quot;&gt;Len Moskowitz&lt;/a&gt;.

I think you are polemically over-reading him. He did a nice job of explicating the Hasidic text. It is similar to a discussion of Sufism that starts off by bracketing out the Shaariah. It does not mean that the Sufi did not keep it and that he was not living a life of shaariah. The article would just show that a given sufi text does not become a universalist ecological pantheism. But with widespread Romantic misreadings of Hasidut, Sufism, and Vendata- Jay was a nice corrective. In fact, Jay serves as a small critique of Art Green&#039;s finding ecology in Hasidism. If you polemic is that he is not frum in your definition or there is a mizvah to attack all who are non-orthodox, then I understand. There are lots of books on the kabbalah or Hasidut of a given rabbi that brackets out his halakhah for an exposition of their thought. In 3k words - one does not kitchen sink everything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Life may be a dream, but that doesn&#039;t absolve us of acting, speaking and thinking correctly.  The Alter Rebbe and RaMKha&quot;L got that, and so do the Vedantists.

(This may take us off the &quot;Natural World&quot; topic of the post.  Do you want to go there?)

Michaelson writes:

&quot;First, I want to set aside non-Hasidic responses to this question, e.g., halachot like bal tachshit, the wide range of religious-aesthetic appreciation of nature in Psalms and elsewhere, ambivalent statements about admiring trees in Pirkei Avot, and the like. &quot;

He sees halakhic responses as being non-Hasidic.  Do you see how he misses the point?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo as welt as most Vendata teachers led active lives of following the ritual laws raising disciples, and building institutes.
Your argument is like of of those old time popular books on mysticism. Since mysticism is unethical antinomian and passive then the Alter Rebbe cannot be a mystic, or in alternate books if he was a mystic then he could not have kept Torah uMizvot or been a community leader.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;...leaves room for the possibility that R. Schneur Zalman believes the world is a “dream,” like his Vedantin counterparts. &quot;

The answer to this question is found in the Alter Rebbe&#039;s actions.  Did he act as if this world was a dream, or did he act as a servant of the Ribono Shel Olam,  impeccably following and explicating the Halakha?  He was, after all, the author of what we today call  Shulkhan Arukh Ha-Rav.
