					<description><![CDATA[Mazal Tov.  I look forward to the book&#039;s publication early next year.  

Obviously, I&#039;m a bit biased about your future writing endeavors as I have taken courses in both kabbalistic meditation and varieties of modern Orthodoxy with you.  So I too would like to see those subjects become books, especially the one on kabbalistic meditation as I have been awaiting that for years.    

In terms of the twitter question, I do think that in the long run, twitter&#039;s use is more about informing people than as a network to further conversation.  I would keep to facebook and google plus for commenting purposes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations. Does the publisher have any plans to create Kindle versions? 

Also just wondering if you or any of your readers have read &quot;What is Talmud? The Art of Disagreement,&quot; by Dolgopolski? Sounds interesting, but I was hoping for a recommendation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the congratulations. 

Abacaxi Mamao- Sorry, indexing and book production has been outsourced to Chennai, India. 

Jordan, we cant make it this week but pencil us in for July 30. 

Tomer- it would be on the medieval texts. Most scholarship explains kavvanot in general. This would be on how they get scripted into tefilah- from berakhot to shema to amidah and after.

Is this a US blog? NYC has the largest group of my readers but the next city is Gush Dan. Most of the people I interview are Anglos in Israel-Buckholtz, Joshua Berman. I review Jewish studies produced in Israel. This blog does not reflect American Jewish concerns like Mah Rabu or Velveteen Rabbi. Is it American?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mazal Tov on achieving a goal! Few things round us out as much as that. I look forward to the book and the soft-cover edition of the first.
I personally would love you to do a lot on Kabbalah. You introduced me to R&#039; IM Morgenstern for which I&#039;m very grateful!]]></description>
