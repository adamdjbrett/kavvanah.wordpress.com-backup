					<description><![CDATA[In the modern age, a time marked by the scientific understanding of knowledge as observation and the notion that knowledge is always provisional - every tradition must struggle with the solvents of erosion even as it must also welcome adaptation as renewal, if not growth. That Modern Orthodoxy - a culture within the Judaism&#039;s already tiny world - sees itself, perhaps rightly, as an icecube in the melting pot is not surprising. How it will continue to manage to survive going forward is anyone&#039;s guess, but it is a conversation that must go on continually.

Thanks to this website for having such interesting guests and thanks also to Charlie Buckholtz, whose authentic engagement with the tradition provides it with nourishment, and his interlocutors with food for thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/interview-with-charlie-buckholtz-co-author-of-new-book-with-david-hartman/#comment-3354&quot;&gt;wfb&lt;/a&gt;.

You can call the Rav&#039;s philosophy a failure, but that raises the question of what&#039;s a success.   Let&#039;s assume that success is measured in the number of adherents over time.   Under that definition, substitutionary atonement is quite a successful doctrine.

I don&#039;t think we have the perspective to say whether the Rav&#039;s philosophy will last 2000 years, like subsitutionary atonement has.  But the triumphalism the Rav offered les at the core of many successful religions.  Few charismatic clergy preach to stadiums about doubt.   As that attitude remains, and many people continue to quote the Rav, it&#039;s hard to say he&#039;s gone the way of the Hittites.

It is not terribly unusual, either, that adherents to a triumphalist philosophy would consider their religion, and even themselves, above criticism (with obvious consequences).]]></description>

Hi,
There is a difference between treating the Torah as supreme and treating contemporary Orthodoxy in that way. The contemporary MO discourse being criticized in this interview, is an attitude that suggests that the current sociology, worldview, ethical sensitivity, halakhic practice etc. of the existing community is ideal and supreme and not subject to criticism. Sometimes a push from outside can let us see what the God intended all along. To take a non-controversial example: Rambam&#039;s study of Aristotle lead him to realize that anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Torah were metaphors that couldn&#039;t be understood literally. We can all think of controversial examples...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While not identical, I think Jacob Taubes&#039; critique of the Rav addresses some overlapping points: 

R. Soloveitchik&#039;s use of the model of mathematics or mathematical physics for explaining how the halakhist understands halakhah is unacceptable. For the fundamental task of the halakhist is to read and interpret texts and there are no two greater opposites than the hermeneutic required for textual interpretation and the construction of mathematical systems.

Unfortunately R. Soloveitchik when he studied in Berlin went &quot;barking up the wrong tree&quot;. He came under the dominant influence of Hermann Cohen when he should have followed the path of Heidegger and later on of Gadamer and Ricoeur. R. Soloveitchik&#039;s philosophy of halakhah must, then, be pronounced a failure, albeit a magnificent failure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;For all his theological creativity and religious pathos, Rav Soloveitchik’s essential stance vis a vis tradition and modernity is both triumphalist and apologetic. He does not tend to adopt the posture of having struggled with, much less having had to rethink any of his assumptions or principles, in light of his encounter with Western ideas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to Jon&#039;s comment, which rings very true, I do wonder in general about the following. It seems that apologetics and triumphalism get a very bad rap. But when you think about it, given that Orthodoxy by definition works within the system of Torah, what is wrong with accepting its supremacy? Isn&#039;t that rather obvious? What is wrong with apologetics and triumphalism (when expressed tastefully, i.e., bereft of gloating), insofar as they are honest attempts at hearing other people&#039;s questions, and providing cogent answers or cogent ways to deal with issues?

Would we not expect from people who accept Torah as the Word of G&quot;d to accept its supremacy and reduce all other sources of insights to (a) how we emotionally deal with the questions raised by other thought traditions (a lot of the Rav&#039;s existentialism can be categorized here), and (b) how what we discover elsewhere may give us tools to better understand what we already know to be true (Tora uMada&#039;)?

Is it not legitimate to feel really at home in Judaism and look from the inside out? Must we all become anthropologists?]]></description>

Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, Dr. B, but it seems this was more a front than anything else, no? It&#039;s quite clear that, at the very least, the Rav learned plenty from philosophy (it&#039;s also worth noting that math and science aren&#039;t in this list), and would have acknowledged it if he weren&#039;t trying to lead Orthodoxy into a more self-confident state of mind.]]></description>
