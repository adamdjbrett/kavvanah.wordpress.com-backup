Dave -- The Torah itself seems to countenance the transfer of bones.  Jacob asked his sons, &quot;Do not bury me in Egypt&quot; (Bereshis 47:29).  Joseph, on the other hand, asked his brothers &quot;You must carry up my bones from here&quot; (50:25).   This seems a pretty clear request for temporary internment and later transfer.  If Joseph thought it inappropriate to do that, he could have made the same request his father did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the beginning of the Common Era when some were buried in tombs, there was the duty of opening the tomb after three days to make sure the supposed deceased were dead.  You can also cross reference in the Tanakh, 2 Kings 13:21, that this indeed happened.  There seems to be an aversion to being buried alive (since orthodox are not embalmed how would one know)   and cremation certainly negates this. And I wouldn&#039;t be so quick to say we know death better with our advanced medicine, especially since business (medicine is business) is trying to squeeze productivity out of fewer workers and there is the golf course of course.  There are still people lucky enough to escape being buried alive but I wouldn&#039;t rely on it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this.  Yes, our historical and halakhic sources are much more nuanced than our popular consciousness on these issues.  

While cremation may indeed seem &quot;more clean and final, more economical,&quot; most people (Jews among them) are unaware of information that runs counter to this perception.   In my experience, the primary unaddressed issues are vulnerability to criminal desecration (the real problem of nivul hamet), environmental costs (and hence the violation of bal tashkhit), and avoidance of the messy human need to grieve our losses.

In recent years I have been compiling &quot;Dust and Ashes&quot; resource materials to facilitate more effective dialogue on Judaism and cremation.  These materials are now available with a 45-minute telephone orientation and tutorial which includes: 

* Strategies for opening and sustaining communication about cremation and end-of-life values 
* Surprising and little-understood complexities of cremation for Holocaust survivor families 
* Basic but little-known facts about the cremation process
* Actual environmental costs of cremation--and environmental justice issues of crematory construction and maintenance 
* Implications of the absence of sh&#039;mirah and levayah 
* The importance of direct rabbinic and lay leadership involvement in practical advocacy for kibbut hamet
* Accessible Biblical and classical rabbinic texts that highlight basic Jewish principles of kibbud hamet
* Excerpts of selected contemporary responsa (including some of those mentioned above) 

Those who are interested in receiving these materials and the accompanying telephone tutorial can contact me via waysofpeace (at) earthlink (dot) net.

With many blessings for Shabbat Shalom and beyond,

Adam,
What is the context for cremation being discussed in 1935 by the Rabbis of Jerusalem? What precipitated it?
Also what is the background behind Maurice Lamm&#039;s stating that kaddish is not said?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone often confronted with Jewish cremation in my hospice work, I thought I would add in a couple of points.
1.  I have come across an different phenomenon regarding cremation and the Holocaust.  While many eschew the practice because of the cremation of our brethren by the Nazi&#039;s, there are people who specifically want to be cremated as a means of connecting with their deceased who were cremated.  
2.  As a hospice chaplain, the subject of cremation is a common conversation.  I am personally averse to cremation as a form of burial.  However, as a chaplain, whose primary role is being supportive to people through spiritual means, I do not intervene to prevent someone from making a choice I disagree with.  I had a situation early in my career in which a non-orthodox family was planning to cremate their mother at her request.  They had made all the arrangements, and then the patient’s son comes over to me and says, my brother-in-law told me that cremation is not allowed according to Jewish law.  In response, I offered him two approaches.  He could either decide not to cremate his mother because cremation is not allowed (the information from your post notwithstanding, and not known by me at the time) or he could decide to follow her wishes.   Either way, I was not going to abandon them when they needed support.  This is a personal approach of mine, not something that I expect everyone to adhere to, but one which I believe serves the situation well.
3.  On the same subject, since many Jewish people are exposed to the Jewish views on death and dying through R. Maurice Lamm’s The Jewish Way of Death and Mourning, it is important to note that he categorically says it is prohibited, which for many is all they ever know.   There is another source, much more nuanced, written by another Orthodox Jewish chaplain, from whom I got the impetus to distinguish between a decision I disagree with and the need to still support the grieving family.  It is found in the book To Walk in God’s Ways, by R. Joseph Ozarowski.  But even there, he provides texts that seemingly indicate more than a mere aversion to the idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Alan,

Thank you for bringing this issue and my work on it to the attention of your readership.  One caveat, to the consternation of Rabbi Lerner quite a few German rabbis permitted burial of the ashes.  They required, however, that they be placed in a separate section of the burial ground.

An article that I wrote addressing the German Orthodox context of the dispute is set to appear in the upcoming volume of the Leo Baeck Institute Year Book.  A second one that focuses on the significance of the debate from the perspective of history of halakhah, particularly approaches to nonobservance, is under review for publication in an additional journal.

Since the first oral presentation, my interest and appreciation for the richness of the subject of cremation and twentieth century Jewry has grown dramatically.  I have gathered a great deal of relevant sources and plan to produce a full-length monograph that spans the entire period.  To offer one small example, recently I shared some of my materials with a group of rabbis from across the denominations.  Afterwards, one participant told me he knew of a case in the 1970s in which two congregants actually asked to be cremated and explained to the rabbi that they saw this as a way of identifying with the martyrs of the Holocaust

If you or any of your readers are aware of relevant materials (rabbinic writings of all denominations - responsa, sermons, essays; personal considerations of the issue, synagogue or cemetery statutes, memoirs, oral history), I would very much appreciate being sent copies or at least bibliographical references.

I can be reached at ksferz@gmail.com.

Sincerely,
Adam Ferziger]]></description>
