					<description><![CDATA[He certainly doesn&#039;t seem at all in the category of Heidegger or Ezra Pound or Paul de Man, at least from the above.  As you know, Heidegger was a collaborator with the Nazis.

Not sure what the Marcion antisemitic overtones you refer to are in Schlegel, but it sounds intriguing.  He married one of Moses Mendelssohn&#039;s daughters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting, thank you.  I came across this while doing research as I am taking a class about Kierkegaard.  A better question might be:  So who wasn&#039;t an antisemite?  I have to say that I was surprised to discover Dietrich Bonhoeffer was also an antisemite despite his opposition to Hitler which lead to his execution.  I discovered this in an article by the insightful Rabbi Michael Leo Samuel, which discussed the antisemitism of Bonhoeffer, Neimoiler and Barth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lazar:  Dostoevsky&#039;s  novels are facile? Surely you jest. Crime and Punishment, for example??? And you really prefer Pound, of all people  to Dostoevsky?

					<description><![CDATA[First, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong, per se, with using outside opinions to elucidate Torah.  Samson Hirsch frequently quoted Schiller and other (non-Jewish) German writers in his drashim.  

Is it not possible that K, despite his anti-Semitism, has some pretty important and relevant things to say?  
I think that this is important investigative work because it gives a fuller picture of a famous person, but I question how it affects reading K&#039;s philosophy--if it does so at all.  

Similarly, I like Pound and Eliot; but for Dostoevsky, however, his anti-Semitism pairs so nicely with his facile novels that I have no problem dismissing him and any relevance he might have to my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan:  Take a look at  her picture.  M. G. Piety -- what a great name!--  is a woman.

Interestingly enough, the emphasis on sacrifice, summission and the absurd are more in K&#039;s  pseudonymous works.  Take a look, however,  at a book K. wrote in his own name, Works of Love, which presents a more &quot;Jewish&quot; and ethical view.]]></description>
