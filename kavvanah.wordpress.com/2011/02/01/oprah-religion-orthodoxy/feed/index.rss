					<description><![CDATA[I drew more general lessons from Oprah’s  success. I think what it takes is that the star or tradition express certain themes that the audience desires to  re-experience  in different variations in the private theater  of their  own consciousness. Consider the case of the Belzer Rebbe, perhaps the most spectacular success story with the exception of Lubavitch. From nothing to thousands of chasidim. If you look at the man, and there are many videos available, he has absolutely no virtues. Larger than a sumo wrestler, dour, walks and talks very slowly, slurs his speech, never makes eye contact and never smiles, few if any interesting torahs at his tish, megalomaniac hasagos and horrible taste...he&#039;s the anti-Oprah. (See the witty and erudite discussions by gevezinerBelzer in recent posts of Tzig.) But in some anti-charismatic way he’s a chusid magnet! How can he do this? I don&#039;t know, but there must be themes that are implicit in his message that are especially appealing, such that there is a great happiness in thinking of oneself as a Belzer and not a chusid of some other rebbe. And the cue is not visual;  the Belzer’s main competitor in terms of lineage , the Machnovka -Belz Rebbe is  straight out of Hollywood casting. The current Belzer has somehow turned his life story into a Holocaust romance how the then Belzer Rebbe escaped the Nazis, and how his orphan nephew  was able to rebuild and recreate the old Belz in an authentic way. Belz, as a dynasty, was itself an uncanny success, coming so many years after the Besht and capturing the imagination of Galitzya almost immediately. Belz as a chasidus  has I think something to do with the very pleasureful wish of being maximally pious, the most frum. 

I point out three other great successes in Orthodox life, Satmer, Lubavitch, and the world of yeshivas understood as a unity in their escape to Shanghi. Each comes with an enormous romantic story, stories so appealing that it becomes enjoyable to dream and think about  being a member of these groups. I think centrist Orthodoxy needs such a story. To focus on the particular narrative of Oprah’s limits the possibilities. I point out that Religious Zionists and the Hesder Yeshiva movement, because they are integral to the great themes of Israel and preserving Orthodoxy have none of the problems found in American MO. No need there for rock ‘n roll shabatons. In short we need to create the excitement  of romance, quest, adventure, and not new variations on Christian Evangelical themes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was happily following along and agreeing with you until your claim of a great tension between self improvement, being a better self on the one hand, and mainstream Judaism on the other, as implied in the following phrase: &quot;Talmud study, halakhah, and philosophy do not deal with the individual.&quot;

The thing is, there is quite a lot out there in traditional Judaism that does deal with exactly these Oprah-esque topics. Mussar, for example, but also a decent part of the literature about teshuvah.

I would rather see the difference in the end goal. For Oprah, self-actualization is an end into itself, for mainstream Orthodoxy, it&#039;s a tool put to the use of avodah. However, even so, is the gap between Oprah as presented here, and the doctrine of sheleimut haadam and even certain forms of deveikut (granted, not the deveikut of the Baal Sem Tov&#039;s brother in law, which is about the dissolution of self awareness) so great? It would rather seem that they are analogous, but operate on a different plane, O of Oprah on the plane of materialism (OK, she&#039;d claim, the spirit) and narcissism, and O of Orthodoxy on the plane of the revealed spiritual path of Torah.

IOW, Aren&#039;t those who adopt this poplar culture doing so because they recognize some memes from their spiritual heritage?]]></description>

There is a huge difference between promoting a way of life that is detached and telling people that their social maladies are to be addressed by looking within. The former is quietistic, that latter actively channels discontent and away from its legitimate target.

Are you among the working poor, have too much stress in your life, can&#039;t find fulfillment in your crappy job? the solution lies within.]]></description>

That critique would apply equally to &quot;unpopular&quot; religion.  The &quot;frum&quot; jew who learns all day, even the most Litvish type, who is not into &quot;popular&quot; religion, is not moved in any significant way to address the problems of the larger society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What bothers me (not that this is a new critique) is that the solidarity fostered is totally pacifistic. Self-help internalizes  social problems within the psyche (just as psychopharmacological approaches to well-being place them within ones&#039; brain) and the result is an acceptance of the social reality as the given.

If this sounds too much like a marxist critique of popular religion -- well, it&#039;s a pretty damn good critique.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Rav was not  integrated as a teacher or a philosopher. He taught like he gave a shiur-one topic at a time. He is therefore an enigmatic thinker whose teachings are very difficult to.integrate and apply. He is a perfect foil for personal MO philosophies, even Opra&#039; since you can his richly worded and obscure language to support almost anything.]]></description>
