					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a while.  

Isn&#039;t this sense that the Torah provides answers implicit in an educational system which puts so much stress on all the details of chumash? We expect our children to know the stories of Bereshit and Bamidbar as well, or as better, as English grammer, mathematical calculation, and the structure of the daily world as taught in science and social studies classes. They are not taught merely the skills to stand up and leyn in shul. And they are not taught merely halakha and its Talmudic antecedents. 

Frankly, we should be glad they are digesting this into pop psychology rather than advocating for polygamy when they grow up....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While what you write is correct about Chumash and much of the rest of Tanakh, the Wisdom literature (including its offshoots in the post Biblical period, like Avot) does provide the kind of material that answers life&#039;s basic questions, at least for some types of questions. There is a strong self help thread running through it, as well as strong philosophical overtones, but it&#039;s also true that that literature is not as easily accessible as the the Bible-as-Guidebook crowd would like to portray. Still, are they so wrong, from this perspective?

Yonathan&#039;s point, that from a Jewish perspective, Torah is much more than  the Bible, and that the self help, guidebook aspects come mostly from later literature, is IMO an important point, too.

Finally, I also think that Jon is right about this being mostly a result of the development of mass literature. See Orthodox by Design by Jeremy Stollow for more on how technology is a large reason why this kind of literature developed and how that in turned impacted the way Orthodox Jews read and write books.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are there books targeted to:

1) Chareidim?
2) Modern Orthodox?
3) Baalei Teshuva?

I suspect that most of this genre is targeted towards Chareidi masses &#038; Baalei Teshuva (and Modern Orthodox consumers of Chareidi mass market literature (i.e. #3 above). I suspect that elites in both Chareidi &#038; MO circles mock this literature, but accept it as good for the masses.

So this may be part of the rise of mass market chareidi publishing, including fiction, self-help, children&#039;s book &#038; needs to be understood in that context and targeted audiences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still, there is a distinction in that for American Orthodox Jews biblical texts themselves play a very limited role in this literature. Torah means a bit of talmud, a bit of shla&quot;h, a bit of mussar, a bit of R. Dessler. It is also not too hard to come to read R. Soloveitchik with no understanding of what he is talking about and it sounds like yet more psychobabble al hatorah. 

There is also the question of where people today see practical wisdom residing. It has to be in an authoritative text that is specifically addressing your question, not in the perfection of certain virtues.]]></description>
