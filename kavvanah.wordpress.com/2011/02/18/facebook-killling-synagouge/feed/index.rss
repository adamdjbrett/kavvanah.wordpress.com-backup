					<description><![CDATA[There is the flipside of this that Church/Synagogue is about identity formation and publicly stating who you and who you are not.

Or rather we attend synagogues with people who we think are like us (e.g. successful &#038; cool; frum; intellectual; etc.) and not with people who we do not wish to be associated.

Faceboook allows one to fashion an identity without having to leave their home.

However, Orthodox Jewish males, like Catholics need to show up to pray, to establish their identity as Orthodox Jews.  Women I suspect show up to establish their identity as &quot;frum&quot;. However, they pick synagogues which reinforce their identities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s another component to this. I completely agree that people (or at least some ppl -- like me) go to synagogue to catch up on community news and socialize. However, facebook and text messaging hasn&#039;t eliminated that need. The reason I often don&#039;t go to synagogue isn&#039;t because I get enough socializing online. It&#039;s because I often get no socializing at synagogue. I have been to so many synagogues where fraternizing is frowned upon and where whispered &#039;hellos&#039; are shushed. I don&#039;t have enough of an institutional history of synagogues to speak with confidence + authority but I suspect that there has been a shift in how certain decorums in synagogue are tolerated (throughout a wide range of denominations). My favorite kind of synagogue is one where ppl chat during the service and are pretty much left alone to wander around and catch up with ppl. But that model of service seems to be less and less tolerated. I&#039;d be interested in seeing how this institutional shift (if it really does exist) maps up historically to synagogue attendance. I remember once at a livingroom minyan I was shushed for whispering &#039;hello&#039; to a friend when he walked in. I wasn&#039;t even carrying on a conversation. Needless to say, I never went back. (Nb, we recently found an egalitarian minyan where chatting is permissible. Not only can I now catch up with people during boring parts of the service, but I can chat with my wife as well. We have started attending shul much more frequently.)]]></description>
