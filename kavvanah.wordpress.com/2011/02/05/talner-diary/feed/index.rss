					<description><![CDATA[I asked my brother in law who is Ger &#038; a chareidi pundit about them:
 
He said the following:

...some real juicy stuff there, but my sources in ger tell me that parts of it are unreliable. Either way, reliable or not, it has a lot of fasnciating stuff in it.
...
Btw, in case you know the guy that wrote this, none of it is about the Tolna court. All of it was written long before the Tolna rebbe became rebbe. the tolna rebbe is a gerer chossid who was a long-time magid shiur  at yeshiva sefas emes. When his grandfather who was the tolna rebbe passed away, he became rebbe. the entire diary is written years before that

I saw that you posted them. Thank you.  I am not interested in general Heimishe gossip. I have not read through them. Is there something significant in them? Even though the Tolner document had lots of gossip, I posted it for the insight into current Israeli Hasidus, waiting for one of my Israeli academic friends to write on the Pnei Menachem.]]></description>

Do you have more details on the publisher or author.
I am actually more concerned with the editing. Is there more than one hand? Is it more than one volume that has been placed in a single file. As some readers noted to me in emails. The maasehlach and the records of yehidus have different styles.]]></description>
