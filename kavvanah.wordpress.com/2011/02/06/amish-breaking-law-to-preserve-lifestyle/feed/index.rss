					<description><![CDATA[If the Amish farmers saw it as a libertarian issue that discussion would be on point.  The article gives very few, if any, hints that they see it that way, however (as part of a generally cursory treatment of the whole issue of motive).  If anything, there may be a suggestion that it is an unjust law not per se but because its premise is &quot;falsehood.&quot;  (i.e., without theoretically questioning the power of the feds to regulate dangerous foods, they question whether the food is really dangerous.)   I guess my point is that it is probably not a libertarian rebellion, but it is not a purely pragmatic one either.]]></description>

Why does the government have any good reason to protect me from people who want to drink raw milk?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This underlines the fact that minorities have to balance their utopian values with self preservation. I think R&#039; Menachem Leibtag captures it best, when he says that sometimes Jews (have to) operate in survival mode, and sometimes in revival mode. The ideal is revival, but history doesn&#039;t always allow that. For him (as for any good preacher, mind you, as that is where choices can be made), we are living in borderline times, where we should progressively switch from survival to revival mode, which, implicitly, recognizes that others may not share his conviction.

This kind of analysis permits us to respond to your question. When in survival mode, the hierarchy of values presumably change, and this Amish farmer (along with many others, I presume, as well as many Orthodox Jews, particularly Chareidim) feels that survival mode is presently called for.]]></description>
