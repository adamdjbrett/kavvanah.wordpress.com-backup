How is this view different from the position held by Leo Strauss? 
The difference is that Strauss thought that all philosophers are atheists, and good philosophers are secretly atheists. This means there can be a wide range of heterodox readings of Maimonides, in which Maimonides believes some small part of what he says, (e.g., he believes the first five of the 13 ikkarim but the rest are &quot;necessary beliefs&quot; which he may or may not accept, as per Menachem Kellner) and still &quot;qualify&quot; as an anti-Straussian.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you AS.  I stand corrected.  The Merriam-Webster on my desk does *not* have it (smaller edition); but the American Heritage Dictionary in my study does indeed show Rabbi Dr. Brill&#039;s usage as the *first* definition of &#039;parabolic&#039;, and my usage as only a second definition.

Sorry.   I wasn&#039;t questioning the use of parables in inquiry.  I was questioning what I think is an incorrect use of the word &quot;parabolic&quot;.  I think that its only use is in relation to a &quot;parabola&quot;, as in a &#039;curve&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I count myself lucky to have been taught pieces of Maimonides by Rabbi Moshe Sokol.  It was fascinating watching him try to open the minds of the congregants, that Maimonides is not a typical &quot;traditional&quot; interpreter, that he has very different ideas,  based on different sources, than American Ashkenazic folk religion.  We did Hil. Deiot and then Rambam&#039;s views about the afterlife and Moshiach.  The afterlife idea was totally different than anything I had seen - all that remains is that part of the intellect which is one&#039;s true ideas about God.  He compared the MT with passages in the Guide and the PhM to get the full span of Maimonides&#039; views.

I mean, yes, from reading the intro to the Mishnah Commentary slowly, I knew that Rambam doesn&#039;t think like anybody else.  Still, it&#039;s different with a good teacher who can integrate all the different passages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; how do we determine which narratives did occur and which didn’t, since they are all presented in straightforward declarative sentences.&lt;/i&gt;

First you ought to clarify the purpose of figuring out which are which. And in this Maimonidean schema there is no reason to do so. The only question is which kind of story it is and thus to what degree it is essential to the knowledge it contains. Whether it happened or not does no bear on that question. Maimonides never held a verificationist theory of truth.

Perhaps the larger lesson of the incident is what happens when you mix modernist epistemologies with medieval philosophy.]]></description>

Yair Lorberbaum never got a chance to present his views. Most of your questions assume one specific construction or the following of a specific interpreter. My own opinion is that Maimonides is subject to a range of interpretations since he used diverse sources and lived in different cultures, and then his interpreters lived in different cultural worlds. So I wont make any arguments in 100 word blog comments.
Yes, Lorberbaum was assuming that most of Genesis and possibly Exodus were parabolic. He never got a chance to develop it. Maimonides specifically excludes the law from these discussions. He actually inserts the statement that it does not apply to the law right in the middle of passages cited. 
Maimonides say in the passage that I quoted that the words of the prophets are to be understood as parabolic or figurative, not as declarative statements. Maimonides uses the criteria of language, logic, argumentation, and metaphysics to decide. He did not use the realms of history or historical study. Maimonides does, however, use a historical argument to explain the original function of the commandments.
The commentary on the Mishnah is different than the Guide. 
Leo Strauss held that he was hiding his views.Here we are dealing with his views that are out in the open. Maimonides was quite open about his Platonic naturalism. It is in the Mishnah Torah. Strauss was looking for an impious Averroistic reading behind the naturalism.  Afterlife is spiritual as a perfection of intellect to cleave to a higher emanated intelligence in very non-twentieth century ways. 
How&#039;s this for a start. Much more than this and I am more comfortable moving to specific verses and specific commentators medieval and modern.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like the congregants in Teaneck I do not know enough about this position. Would you lay it out a bit more explicitly?  I assume this understanding of  Maimonides has him talking of entire stories, like Genesis 1-11, and not just anthropomorhisms. 

As I understand your post, on this view many/all/some of the narrative of the Torah never happened. My question is how do we determine which narratives did occur and which didn’t, since they are all presented in straightforward declarative sentences. Do we allow Biblical criticism, archeology and the like to determine our attitudes. Also, if some  story never happened, was the story  nevertheless given by God to Moses? Are the 613 mitzvot actually commanded by God? 2) Why did the Rambam present the 13 dogmas that must be held if one is not to be a heretic. Was  this also for political or other pragmatic reasons? 3) Did the Rambam believe  there was an afterlife when the righteous are rewarded and the bad are punished? 4) How is this view different from the position held by Leo Strauss? Are all these questions incredibly naïve?]]></description>
