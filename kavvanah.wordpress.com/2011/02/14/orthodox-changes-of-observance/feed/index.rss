					<description><![CDATA[&quot;cater to Jews of all stripes&quot;.  Well, depends what you mean by &quot;cater to&quot;.  If you mean cater as in provide food, well, that&#039;s a big deal for Chabad Travel Services - you&#039;re in an out of the way city, you want someplace nice to go for Shabbos, you call the Chabad Rabbi.  But if you&#039;re a member of their shul, and you&#039;re already observant in a non-Chabad model, that they may perceive as a threat, and not be all that happy about interacting with you.

Or so has been my experience.]]></description>

Contrast this with the Sephardi world where there are many folks who are  less observant, but who wouldn&#039;t be caught dead in a Conservative or Reform synagogue, much less a Reconstructionist or Renewal one.

Maybe the Orthodox world is becoming more accommodating to those with  diverse levels of practice?  Maybe you can be gay and still find a place in an Orthodox shul.  Maybe you can eat treif and still find a place.

I doubt that there is one - it is entirely personal. One person will join a non-orthodox congregation, another will decide to attend a concert on shabbat, another will order a peperoni with extra cheese, another will change his Jdate profile. The significance that each person will attach to these acts will depend on an irreducible set of psychological and social variables.]]></description>

AS- I think that you are correct. Focusing on demography blurrs that the chats are different.
Returning to chat  #1 - You phenomenology point is well taken. Where would be the line out of Orthodoxy from phenomenology point of view? Is there one?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Focusing on the demographics and affiliations ignores the phenomenological perspective. I often wonder what people are experiencing with that level of observance -- not the reason they would give for doing x not y  if you asked them. My sense is that if you cut out daily prayer, keep lax kashrut standards outside the house, privately are not too careful about shabbat (occasionally check e-mail?) , you have a pretty similar experience of living an orthodox life as someone who prays quickly at home or work, keeps kosher but will eat a green salad with olive oil at a restaurant, and reads the newspapers on shabbat at home. So from the experiential perspective there is actually very little sense of having moved out of orthodoxy. That&#039;s quite different than chalking it up to habit or nostalgia.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, and sometimes I tell people I am Orthodox, sometimes I say &quot;just observant,&quot; sometimes I affiliate with the &quot;observant egalitarian crowd,&quot; and sometimes I tell people that I am post-Orthodox.

I definitely don&#039;t affiliate as Conservative or Reconstructionist (although I find the flexibility of what passes for Conservative Judaism these days attractive at time, and sometimes find Reconstructionist theology compelling), and I&#039;m quite far from Reform.

I will say that I have never, in my life, missed a kiddush or havdalah. Even when I haven&#039;t really cared, I haven&#039;t abandoned that. (I have missed candle-lighting many times, though.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I mostly daven at an Orthodox shul, although I sometimes go to a local, egalitarian, non-denominational shul for Shabbat mincha. I have mixed observances. I mostly keep kosher. Sometimes I get raw, green salads at non-kosher restaurants (mostly soup-and-salad joints) and I never put onions into them (out of habit?), but I sometimes include hard-boiled eggs, portabella mushrooms (with vinegar), or feta cheese. No dressing, also out of habit, I suppose. Sometimes I get a slice of spinach feta pie. I used to daven three times a day, but now I daven once or twice over Shabbat and on most yom tovs. I don&#039;t usually turn lights on or off on Shabbat. Sometimes I watch television. I rarely violate Shabbat in public. I can&#039;t imagine cooking on Shabbat. I have taught Judaic studies courses to people who assume that I am strictly Orthodox.

My grandparents were the drive-to-Orthodox shuls type. My parents became frummer and sent their four kids to day school. I also went for a year in Israel. I love(d) learning Torah. I was the model of Modern Orthodoxy. I was told that I was the promise--the future--by people who thought they could prognosticate.

There is so much ridiculousness in the community, though. I see so much idiocy, so much fear-mongering, so much male chauvanism. I no longer really know if keeping kosher means never eating unhechshered feta cheese.

Anyway, just another data point.]]></description>

Boy, that was quick.
As a side question(s):What role does popular culture like heavy metal play in your life? How does it relate to your religiosity? How would you want educators and rabbi to treat, or relate to, your musical taste?]]></description>
