					<description><![CDATA[Pragmatism doesn&#039;t make for good halachic reasoning.  It does have a role afterwards in determining application.  But to simply say, &#039;Rambam&#039;s position is tough to live with&#039; is to say nothing of note at all.  What&#039;s more, Rav Aviner lives in Israel.  His is a more complex reality that allows the luxury at home of taking a more narrowly defined position; while necessitating new perspectives on how do we deal with the big world in terms of diplomacy, etc.  The specific issue he addressed was about a Jewish institution in the State of Israel accepting money from a (in his view) forbidden source.  He thinks this is consistent with our renewed ability to live in a more independent manner.  He also notes mainstream sources that he thinks support or compel this position.  Certainly we may differ; but there has to be a better argument than &#039;it would be tough&#039;.

I would note, by the way, that Rav Aviner doesn&#039;t tend to be strict on many matters of halacha.  His record as a community rav is out there.  But in this I think he is following pretty closely the influence of Rav Tzvi Yehudah, who was especially sensitive to matters related to avodah zarah.

I suppose in the 50s you would have agreed with Ben Gurion rather than Begin on the reparations issue.  I don&#039;t know what I would have done; but I admire and am glad that Begin protested.  It helped us to maintain our consciences.   Maybe Rav Aviner is doing the same.  Strict pragmatism has a way of pushing conscience aside.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/rav-aviner-has-bad-dreams-about-christains/#comment-2627&quot;&gt;Mordechai Y. Scher&lt;/a&gt;.

Scher

It was not my intention to criticize Rabbi Aviner or suggest that he adopt a different position, just that he is making the decision to operate from a specific range of Jewish sources. Jacob Katz made the argument that the Tosifists engaged in a balancing act between saying that Christianity is idolatry and avoiding the implications of that position of having to employ the full range of Talmud restrictions on interaction with idolaters. This would have made life in Christian Europe impossible. Sefer Hasidim is not a halachic source at all, but a guide for going beyond the law. 
Maimonides is certainly a valid halachic opinion. There were Christians in medieval Cairo, just as the rabbis in the Talmud had some interaction with Christians. That being said these restrictions would, if seriously followed through, make it impossible to live in a Christian dominated society. Think of all the chaos created by the issue of Indian hair being idolatrous offerings. What if it was not just wigs that you had to be worried about, but every product?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rav Aviner grew up in post WWII Catholic France.  The Christian world he knew probably required a lot more practical accommodation than an American grad student teaching in a Jewish school experiences.   And he is certainly aware of the Meiri and Tosafot.  Why must he adopt their perspective?

As for Rambam, his context was certainly Muslim.  But he dared to state positions regarding Christianity.  Were there no Christians in his world?  Are we saying he was unqualified to have an opinion?  Might it even be that his opinion was less influenced/distorted precisely because he didn&#039;t have to live with the daily accommodations that hachmei Ashkenaz did?

As for modern thinkers, where does Rav Soloveitchik fall here?  He was very much a &#039;Rambamist&#039;, and very much of product of European thinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This piece got me into a Jacob Katz mode of thinking. What caught my attention is that Rabbi Aviner is suggesting a policy toward Christianity based on Maimonides, who operated within a Muslim context and never had to deal with the practical consequences of living in a Christian society, and Sefer Hasidim, hardly a normative halachic source. Let alone not forming policy based on the Meiri, Rabbi Aviner is not even operating based on Ashkenazic thought at all as far as I could tell. What would it mean to apply Aviner to the United States; what if medieval Ashkenaz operated based on him?]]></description>
