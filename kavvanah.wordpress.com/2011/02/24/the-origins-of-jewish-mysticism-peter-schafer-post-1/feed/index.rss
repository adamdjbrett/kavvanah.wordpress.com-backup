					<description><![CDATA[You could write an entire book just devoted to the methodological problems of trying to reconstruct early Jewish mysticism. All you need to do is go through the methodological problems in late biblical apocalyptic texts, dead sea scrolls, all of talmudic literature, hekhlot, proto kabalah, etc. etc. Then you compound it by having people delving into literature that is out of their realm of specific expertise. Then you go back and trace the genealogy of all the disputes to Scholem and Urbach ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your outline.  I&#039;m reading another Peter Schafer book right now.  He challenges some of the Judaica scholarship canon there as well.  In the introduction to his 2002 book &quot;Mirror of His Beauty&quot; he writes:

&quot;I am also aware that it is a delicate venture for any &quot;serious&quot; historian to propose the possibility of the inward Jewish adaptation of Christian patterns.  Not only does such research easily incur the reproach of being speculative and not providing sufficient evidence.  Moreover, and more precariously, the historian is exposed to the danger of consciously or unconsciously bringing his/her own personal background into the sacred halls of scholarship and, depending on that background, betraying his/her own identity or oppressing the identity of the other.  Woe to the historian of Judaism who happens to be Christian (Roman Catholic, no less) and to &quot;discover&quot; that the Christian veneration of Mary might have had an impact on the feminine manifestation of God in the Kabbalah!  And yet, in the long run, I am confident in our ability to liberate ourselves, not only from medieval stereotypes, but also from modern ones.&quot; (15)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EJ: I think Schafer and Langerman are refering specifically to Liebes&#039; use of parallels re Sefer Yetzirah .

In Ben  Idel refers to and attempts  to rebut my critique of him. I, not surprisngly, do not accept the validity of Idel&#039;s rebuttals. I hope to return to this one day.  For the meanwhile, Idel confuses history with math and logic. In math, if A=B and B=C, then A=B=C. In history Mr. X might  have believed that A=B, Mr. Y that B=C, and Mr.Z that A=C. That does not mean that there was anyone who believed that A=B=C.]]></description>

HaTziyoni, 
He prefers the word magic - the use of the word theurgy was an Idelism only loosely based on the original Neo-platonic meaning. He wants everything defined based on a given historical era. For him the question is not the in house israeli issue of continuity, but the historical meaning of that era. Greco-Roman is not Medieval Ashkenaz in the cultural context even if a concept has continuity.

EJ- Liebes thinks like a dictionary. His father is the translator of Plato into Modern Hebrew and he mastered Arabic in the army. His PhD was  the start of a Zohar dictionary that he never finished. He does not accept conceptual arguments in class or  similarities in ideas. He needs a linguistic parallel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post! I&#039;m curious, does Schafer also object to the Idel/Liebes theory of reading Talmudic texts as deeply theurgical? And does he add anything to the debate on the centrality of the Mythic element (Liebes, Fishbane Sr. too)? i.e. the central (anti-scholem) claim that &quot;Talmudic Judaism&quot; lends itself in many ways to be continued by Classical Kabbalah elaborated upon?]]></description>
