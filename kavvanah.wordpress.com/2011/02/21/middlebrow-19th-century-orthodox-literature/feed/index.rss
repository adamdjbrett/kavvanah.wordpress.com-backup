					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me Jewish culture is subject to two opposing forces. We want to feel there is a distinctive Jewish voice and point of view, but we will be incapable of producing anything substantive if we are not open to the general culture and the great books of this Western culture. Let&#039;s talk about a modern Jewish culture. By modern I mean people who are  aware that their values are not Torah values, and they are willing to stand behind their values. Modern people feel slavery is wrong as are cruel punishments and animal sacrifices. But most importantly  modern people feel they can chart the course of their own life and should be as free as possible from subjection to the will of others. In this secular sense of modern it is silly to think of closing oneself off from the world. It would be like rediscovering the wheel. The great novelists and philosophers have been working on this issue of living in a secular world going on two centuries, and they have already laid out the major themes.
All the major Jewish cultures of modern times started with the problem of modernity. For example what is called the German-Jewish symbiosis, (Benjamin, Bloch, Kafka, etc.), Yiddishist Bundist culture, Labor Zionist culture all began with the premises of modernity or secularism. Orthodox cultures start with the premises Torah is both true and relevant. I don&#039;t know of any serious contributions of Orthodoxy to modern dilemmas other than to become Orthodox and stop being modern. Am I wrong in my assessment?]]></description>
