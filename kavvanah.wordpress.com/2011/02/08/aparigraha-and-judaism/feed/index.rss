					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Warren Buffet makes a ton of money each year and promptly gives it to charity. Why would anyone want him strolling around Mizener Park?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Which reminds me of the story my late father told me, of a rich man who decided he had enough, and started coming to beis medrash to learn. The rebbe/rav of the town saw him, strolled over, and shut the wealthy retiree&#039;s gemara, saying poor Jews need their patron. I am not sure whether this was a legend or a story he remembered from his youth in Poland (it&#039;s a kind of story that could have happened dozens of time all over again). But it confirms @ej&#039;s suggestion. Tellingly, my father had told me that the rav in question was a chassid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great article, thank you. I love comparisons of virtues between religions- being an off again on again observant Jew with a background in Hindu and Buddhist practice (including three years as a Buddhist monastic).
I wanted to offer a clarification about aparigraha and it&#039;s relation to the Jewish ideas of &quot;sameach b&#039;chelko&quot; and &quot;histapkut&quot;. Aparigraha was, historically, a practice more then it was an attitude. It is mentioned in both Jain texts and in Patanjali&#039;s Yogasutras (the core text of the classical meditative renunciant tradition which although originally composed outside of mainstream Indian religion was absorbed into the mainstream and is now considered one of the ur-texts of Hindu mysticisim).
Aparigraha, or &quot;non-hoarding&quot;, &quot;not taking&quot;, refers to not possessing things. It was and is practiced mostly by sadhus (renunciants) and refers to literally owning next to nothing or in extreme cases nothing. Someone practicing aparigraha might own only a bowl or only a loin cloth or even go naked. For a Jewish analogue I can only think of kabbalistic gerushin practices where sages would go into exile as wanderers who, I assume, took very little with them and relied on the kindness of strangers and admirers. It seems closer to the idea of histapkut above, although a more radical version.
There is another practice, both a Jain virtue and one of the &quot;niyamas&quot; (restraints) in the Yogasutras, known as santosha, which I think is more a accurate analogue for many of the ideas in the Jewish quotes above, and is closer to &quot;sameach b&#039;helko&quot;. Santosha means &quot;contentment&quot; ( the word is etymologically related to &quot;santi&quot;, peacefulness). Santosha refers to being content with whatever you have, to being easily satisified, to being simple. Of course Santosha and Aparigraha are closely related concepts, but classically there is a difference between them- one is more of an attitude, one more of a practice. It is of course possible to create a non-renunciant analogue for monastic aparigraha, which could be practiced by people in the world. This would probably look a lot like the Jewish teachings given above.
One more note: one should be aware that many Yogic and Hindu concepts are currently being re-imagined and re-configured for the West and modern westernized Asia.. This takes many forms, including ones which turn the religious or metaphysical into the psychological and/or soften or make more capitalist/consumer/hedonist friendly a tradition whose mysticism was traditionally fiercely ascetic in both attitude and practice. I am not judging this phenomenon as good or bad, simply warning that one has to be careful about information one hears about Yogic, Hindu, Jain or Buddhist practices, and look deeply into the matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some people engage in meaningless consumption; most however enjoy luxuries, and look forward to more. Histapkus is against even &#039;meaningful&#039; consumption . Consumption is also not necessarily conspicuous, compulsive, obsessive or addictive. But  why then is histapkus opposed to any non-necessary consumption ?
Does Histapkus mean that whenever we pass a certain threshold of wealth we should retire, sit in Boca, or are we  then supposed to devote our lives to good deeds. If the latter it would seem we can do more good deeds  by continuing to run after money. Warren Buffet makes a ton of money each year and promptly gives it to charity. Why would anyone want him strolling  around Mizener Park? Let him strive and strive to make money until he dies.
What if there is no striving, we just have oodles because of inheritance or a lottery ticket. Is the point then to give it away immediately and not enjoy any of it? Why? Because enjoying the benefits of money over and above necessities is a bad thing to do, because we should take no pleasure in our wealth. Does histapkus presuppose it is bad to enjoy the world, to enjoy life. Are we supposed to say as a matter of religious virtue “I’m happy eating my gruel in my tiny dwelling, who needs sunlight, beauty and material pleasures?” Histapkus seems to presuppose that perishus, asceticism is a virtue.
In Torah circles this preaching against pursuing wealth is combined with the virtues of learning Torah all the time. I think histapkus works best with the claim that instead of enjoying life  we should substitute  learning of torah and saying tehilim and the like, (except for the joy in performing mitvot and attending seudos mitzvah.) And we all should do this from bar-mitzvah to grave, men and women.  So one last time, we should spend our time here on earth with our face in a torah book, looking up only for the necessities of life. Call me bourgeois, but aren&#039;t such claims excessive?

					<description><![CDATA[That phrase (Avos 4:1 above) characterized my Dad, in fact, it was the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thanbook.blogspot.com/2010/06/remarks-on-dad-hareini-kaparat-mishcavo.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my eulogy for Dad&lt;/a&gt;.  Not that we were poor, but we certainly had a lot less than a lot of other people at Ramaz.  But we always had enough.

I don&#039;t think Dad ever forgot the Depression, and all the hard work he &#038; his parents had to do to get by.  

Having enough must include saving for old age, in our culture where grandparents don&#039;t generally live with their children.]]></description>
