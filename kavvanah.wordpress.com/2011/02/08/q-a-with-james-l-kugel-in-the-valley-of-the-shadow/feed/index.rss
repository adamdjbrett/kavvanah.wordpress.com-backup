					<description><![CDATA[Also, in a speech I heard from Kugel based on one of his books (I forget which), he contrasted the difference between the different types of G-d in the Bible.  And he certainly stressed the personal G-d who comes by and visits people (I remember once example with Samson&#039;s parents).  So what gives here?  Obviously the Jews of old had both concepts.  And those have to come to us in modern day -- we have both concepts and you need to find balance between them.  Of course G-d is immense and not understandable.  But equally He created us and ask things of us personally.  So...  I don&#039;t get Kugel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having designed electronics, I know that pushing an elevator call  button that&#039;s already been pressed sometimes does indeed have an effect.  Though the switch light is already lit, the internal controller may register the subsequent button pushes, and if the designer allowed for it, the elevator might make a beeline to the requesting floor, skip stops it might otherwise make, send another car to that floor, or otherwise modify the traffic  algorithm.

Kugel may have thought that it was futile, but maybe the button pushers knew something that Kugel didn&#039;t?]]></description>
