I think you basically have got it. Certeau is the route since popular culture historians use him. If you want to do get to the same place with colonial studies, that would also work for the basic thesis. Colonial studies do use Certeau, but went way beyond him with their Althussaer. 
The value in Certeau is the emphasis on place, language, everyday life, and his not focusing on power and Foucault issues. Certeau is also useful for addressing those who still think everyday practice is ideologically determined from above.
I think the Lacan incredible important but the official orthodox community does not think in psychoanalytic terms. It is foreign to them without a resonance. They treat Freud as needless allegory, so there is little place for Lacan or Kristeva.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All these recent posts are vaguely connected, as if you are trying to get us to look at the two worlds we all inhabit in a somewhat different way. Let me try to put this new way into my framework. One can see the yeshiva experience as  studying Talmud lishmah, coupled with the multiple evasions of this task that is made possible by different types of resistance. Going to yeshiva is   another example of the themes of Post Colonial Studies. Here is the master, the rosh yeshiva and here are the colonized students who cannot go head to head with their teachers lest they be thrown out of school. If this becomes the model for our post yeshiva life, we are always conforming and dreying, trying to both remain connected to the community but still preserve some of our individuality. This picture  generally presupposes what you have described as strict compliance model for Orthodoxy.

The other picture, more difficult to perceive, is an Orthodoxy with no masters. The Big Other in Lacan jargon is our own creation. When authority disappears so does the need for evasion and resistance. We see instances of this . A guy drives to an Orthodox shul on shabbus without qualms; he is even disappointed he didn’t get shishi . The New Jersey kids described here who text with no qualms. Tefilin dates. Family size. The rabbis say no internet and the entire Orthodox world says “You gotta be kidding.”Bugs in broccoli, maybe, worms in fish probably not, microbes in the water, get out of my face.&quot; And we have also seen issues flip from evasion to no inner conflict. Evolution started out as c”v, moved to a maybe, and has now flipped to ‘how farchnukt can you get not to accept what is obvious.’ Those who accept this model might have as their chant “We want the 1950’s now.”
The new leftist hero, Gene Sharp was just quoted in the Times as saying “If people are not afraid of the dictatorship, that dictatorship is in big trouble.”
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/world/middleeast/17sharp.html?scp=2&#038;sq=gene%20sharp&#038;st=cse

Most Orthodox bildungsromane have elements of both models. Conflict, anxiety, struggle, some defeats and at the same time “I was curious and interested. I just did it. Everything turned out fine.” 

All this is experience near and clear enough. What is the value added of Certeau?]]></description>
