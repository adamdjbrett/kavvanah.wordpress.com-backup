					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Brill, your correspondent is a friend of mine (he can confirm that).  Below is my slightly redacted email I sent him about this post.

&lt;i&gt;My feeling on reading it was how different and yet the same our experience was.  We&#039;re both intellectual defectors from Orthodoxy--the observances are not problematic for us (though I&#039;ve no doubt you&#039;re adjusted them to your comfort just as I have).  We even went to the same yeshiva.  But rock was never an issue in my home and personal life, so it could never serve as a fulcrum from which to pry off Orthodoxy.  My parents didn&#039;t necessarily like the music I listened to, but it was not a big deal.  It was a lot like eating pizza: something the school forbade and that my parents ignored. 

Growing up, my house was pretty liberal.  Some movies, some TV, rock music, and books galore.  It wasn&#039;t a party scene; movies and TV were subject to limits.  But what normal home of any religious type or subtype doesn&#039;t have limits on that?  This created a unspoken sense in me that the yeshiva&#039;s stances were not sacrosanct.  The &quot;policy&quot; played out in other ways too: [redacted yeshiva] pressured me to go to Camp [redacted], but my parents went me to much more MO camps (e.g. [redacted]).

Because of this rock music never created a conflict with my Orthodoxy; it just never occurred to me that it should since it fell into kosher-for-OJ-but-not-for-yeshiva in my mental categorization.

What did for me what rock music did for you was evolution.  Evolution was something that (from my POV as a kid) was universally treyf for OJ, but, to my discovery upon reading more widely, was something that was actually as certainly true as anything we know.  That put a nice, healthy crack in my Orthodoxy, into which the lever was comfortably inserted.  Other fields played roles too, particularly books on critical thinking and skepticism, but minor roles.  I didn&#039;t even discover modern Bible scholarship until I was (mentally) long gone from Orthodoxy.

That&#039;s not to say either evolution or rock music is a unique, better, or more effective cleanser of Orthodoxy.  In retrospect, what they had in common was something not intrinsic to themselves: they were perceived as foreign to OJ.  However, even with that caveat, it&#039;s important to note that in the end result we&#039;re both &lt;/i&gt;intellectual&lt;i&gt; defectors from Orthodoxy.  The thread we pulled was different, but the unraveling itself was only possible because Orthodox Judaism is not true.  We arrived at the same endpoint from different starting points because while there&#039;s lots of reasonable places to get started, there&#039;s only one reasonable conclusion.  You can&#039;t &quot;solve&quot; the problem of people like us by integrating (or at least not forbidding) rock music or evolution into Orthodox Judaism.  People like us, who enjoy Shabbos, take pleasure in Chanukah, study Judaica for fun, etc. are not responsive to the same remedies as those for whom observance, family, or school is or was a source of pain.  To &quot;fix&quot; us they&#039;d have to make Orthodox Judaism true; allowing rock music and evolution can&#039;t do that.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>
