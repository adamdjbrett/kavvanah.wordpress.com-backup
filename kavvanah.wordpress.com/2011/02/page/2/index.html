Stanford University Press</em>, 2010 was reviewed when it came out by a literature professor Ritchie Robertson (St. John&#8217;s College, Oxford) and I originally did not take much notice. But having just read the book, I found it a gold mine of information on the cultural world of German Orthodoxy. The entire last chapter is on the popular middlebrow books written by Rabbi SR Hirsch’s daughter- Sarah Guggenheim and those by Rabbi Markus Lehrman.</p>
<p>Robertson wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>As German Jews, from the eighteenth century on, entered the world of German culture, they became strongly attached to the literature of the Enlightenment and classicism (Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Friedrich von Schiller, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe), which often expressed universal and humane ideals and were central to _Bildung (cultivation). Indeed, as David Sorkin argued in a landmark work of scholarship (The Transformation of German Jewry, 1780-1840 [1987]), their continuing attachment to Bildung while the Gentile society around them lowered its cultural standards made them, without realizing it, a distinctive subculture that was only nominally assimilated.<br />
Hess recognizes the need to complicate the outdated German binary distinction between &#8220;high&#8221; literature and Trivialliteratur.Middlebrow literature is situated between the two</p>
<p>Hess&#8217;s approach is well illustrated by his first chapter, on the nineteenth-century German-Jewish historical novel.  [The second chapter is on] the &#8220;ghetto novel,&#8221; pioneered by Leopold Kompert, aimed to reach two audiences. In writing about the enclosed  Jewish communities of Eastern Europe that were on the verge of dissolution, Kompert wanted to awake among his Jewish readers nostalgia for their own past and an appreciation of the often tragic conflict of tradition with modernity. Among his Gentile readers, he wanted to arouse sympathy for Jewish communal life and for the tragic isolation experienced by those who first broke away from it. </p>
<p>[The third chapter is on ]The self-appointed guardians of Jewish literature, such as Ludwig Philippson, were ambivalent about another genre, that of romantic fiction. Continuing the eighteenth-century polemic against undisciplined reading, they denounced such books as inducing the spiritual equivalent of curvature of the spine. </p>
<p>Literature is naturally subversive: it questions and undercuts the simplistic ideologies for which people try to instrumentalize it. By that standard, the fiction of orthodoxy discussed in Hess&#8217;s final chapter is barely literature. He reveals a lost continent of fiction which tried to show that orthodox Judaism was compatible with modern Western culture. This genre was founded by Sara Hirsch Guggenheim, daughter of the leading neoorthodox rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. To enforce its message that orthodoxy is the key to happy family life, it defines itself against the classics of high culture, deploring the temptations to immorality offered by Heinrich Heine and Schiller, and isolating itself firmly from the literary mainstream.<br />

<p>When I actually read the book, I found an enlightening, funny, and highly critical analysis of Orthodox popular literature and may be first time that Bourdieu and Baudrillard were used to discuss Orthodoxy. I gained lots of little tidbits about the journal Jeshuran and the Orthodox world of it readers.</p>
<p>Mordechai Breuer wrote about orthodox middlebrow literature  “By reading classical drama and modern novels in their armchairs people imagined that they were full-fledged participants in German cultural life.” (cited on 167) Hess’s attitude toward Orthodox literature expands this statement.People may affirm high culture but are really formulating a particularistic derivative version. They carved out a minority niche within a contemporary field to give Jews a means of acquiring cultural capital that was necessary for social integration. The literature was an imagined identity of “a harmonious union between modern culture and a self-consciously orthodox Judaism” built on differentiation of themselves from those orthodox who did not read the middlebrow literature. (167)</p>
<p>The middle class life of a blissful marriage and financial success are credited to keeping the traditional practices.</p>
<p>Hess points out the self-serving hubris in Orthodox statements that reveled their self-perception in which they thought that Orthodoxy allows one to offer critical assessments of the greatest authors in literature unavailable to public at large. In their mind, they thought  that the secular world only takes the worst of the romantic authors but Orthodoxy is uniquely situated to appreciate the best. Orthodoxy was situated to exist in perfect harmony with German literature in ways that the broader culture could not. </p>
<p>Orthodox fiction portrays itself in its introductions “orthodox fiction harbors the potential to be an art form superior to European high culture.” (185) In self-praise the orthodox protagonists are shown to know Schiller while the reformers are counterfactually portrayed as mixing up Goethe, Shakespeare and Schiller. Reformers are characterized as following the ignoble characters in literature while orthodoxy learns from the noble characters. Rabbis in the stories can always quote the best of the high culture even as they are warning people not to let it lead people astray.</p>
<p>Most minority literature seeks to reframe center and periphery and extol the virtues of the periphery. This literature “enshrines itself as the epitome of high culture in its own insular sphere, with grand gestures that were of little interest to the non-orthodox- and that would have alienated non-Jewish devotees of Schiller, Heine, and other classical writers.”  (188)</p>
<p>The long shelf life of this literature shows that these tensions continued for many decades.</p>
<p>Despite proclaiming its superiority, the orthodox literature was clearly derivative from secular works And the fact that the audience did not mind that the works were unoriginal copies shows that this literature led few back to the original classical works.  They were proud to be derivative because it showed that their own works expressed the classical sentiments in an orthodox manner better than the originals. Their works were derivative in borrowing plots, themes, and subject matter  and most in the community thought that it was a good thing because it made the community aware of these important literary plots and themes.In their mind these Orthodox works looked and read the same way the classical works did.</p>
<p> It created a <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation.html">simulacrum </a>as described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard">Baudrilliard</a> of being a secular fiction when in reality it was entirely orthodox. “Needless to say, there never was an orthodox Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary.” (192) A self-conscious embracing of orthodoxy becomes a panacea to all social ills and social tensions and commitment to orthodoxy concurrently offers the simularcrum of possessing secularity and secular erudition.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I gave a run down of what actually was taught and discussed <a href="../../14/maimonides-in-teaneck/index.html">in an earlier post.</a> He did not present his books.<br />
For those not familiar with his work. Lorberbaum  has his doctorate in Jewish thought from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and is a professor at Bar-Ilan University&#8217;s Faculty of Law. </p>
<p>His book: Image of God: Halakha and Aggadah [Hebrew] Schocken: Tel Aviv and Jerusalem 2004 His recent book is:  Subordinated King, Kingship in Classical Judaism, Bar Ilan Press: Ramat Gan, 2008 (forthcoming in English: Continuum [2011]).</p>
<p>His first book showed that the mythic ideas of the Talmud about the human person as literally the image of God in which the human was also in the physical image of God and that human were raised to a divine status. In turn, these ideas were continued and developed in diverse ways by Maimonides and Nahmanides. </p>
<p>From a review by  Joshua Kulp 	</p>
<blockquote><p>The central thesis of Lorberbaum&#8217;s book is that according to the rabbis, the meaning of imago dei is that there is tangible divine presence within every human being. This concept impacted primarily upon two areas of halakhah: the death penalty and procreation. Since humans are physical representations of God, execution is equivalent in some ways to deicide. Conversely, procreation is strongly mandated because it increases God&#8217;s physical manifestation in the world by creating more vehicles in which to embody God&#8217;s presence. </p>
<p>Importantly, as “images” of the divine, human beings function as icons in a manner similar to the way idols function in the pagan world; they draw God&#8217;s presence into themselves, blurring the borders between representation and form. Finally, the drawing of God&#8217;s presence into the human body dictates that human beings are embodied with significant theurgic powers.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s presence in man pertains, according to the Tannaim, to all the components of his psyche, as to the physical ones&#8221; (Image of God, p. 19).</p>
<p>A central image that nurtures the halakhic process and provides a basis for the tangible bond between God and man is the &#8220;King and His imagery&#8221; model. Thus, for example, the midrash from Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael:</p>
<p>How were the Ten Commandments given? Five on one tablet, and five on the other. By writing &#8220;I am the Lord your God,&#8221; and opposite it, &#8220;You shall not murder,&#8221; Scripture states that if anyone sheds blood, Scripture regards this as if he diminishes the image of the King. This is comparable to a flesh-and-blood king who entered a province, and portraits of him were set up, images were made of him, and coins of him were minted. Some time later, his portraits were overthrown, his images were smashed, his coins were canceled, and thus diminished the image of the king. So, too, if anyone sheds blood, Scripture accounts it for him as if he diminishes the image of the King, as it is said [Genesis 9:6]: &#8220;Whoever sheds the blood of man &#8230; for in His image did God make man&#8221; (Image of God, p. 301).</p>
<p>Lorberbaum takes note of the manner in which a single idea is explicated in different circumstances, thereby functioning as a sort of curator of works of art whose depth is realized when they are placed one next to the other. This is a breathtaking act, that enables us to follow the series of interpretive processes from which the Rabbis&#8217; worldview was built.</p>
<p>The book ends with a chapter that describes the transition from the focal point of sanctity in the Temple to the conception that man is the location of the current domicile of the Godhead on earth. This process, that began in the early Pharisaic literature, intensified upon the destruction of the Temple: &#8220;Although God had left the Temple, He did not desert the earth. To the contrary, in many senses He is much closer, because He is present in man (in every man), who is made in His image&#8221; (Image of God, p. 468).</p>
<p>The second conclusion is halakhic. In one of the key sentences in his book, Lorberbaum argues that the idea of the image of god is not the personification of God, but a claim of the divine dimension in man. Patently, any fundamental myth (whatever it may be) does not exempt us from the mission, the Sisyphean effort, to establish the image of God in man in our actions: in the activity of educators and medical staff, who cope on a daily basis with the patient&#8217;s flawed image of God; in the courts, the media, the army. </p></blockquote>
<p><em>His forthcoming book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disempowered-King-Monarchy-Classical-Literature/dp/1441140883/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297611010&amp;sr=8-1"><strong>Disempowered King Monarchy in Classical Jewish Literature</strong></a> studies the conception of kingship, and its status, powers and authority in Talmudic literature. The book deals with the conception of kingship against the background of the different approaches to kingship both in Biblical literature and in the political views prevalent in the Roman Empire. In the Bible one finds three (exclusive) approaches to kingship: rejection of the king as a legitimate political institution &#8211; since God is the (political) king; a version of royal theology according to which the king is divine (or sacral); and a view that God is not a political king yet the king has no divine or sacral dimension. The king is flesh and blood; hence his authority and power are limited. He is a &#8216;subordinated king&#8217;.</em></p>

				<p>Many attend synagogue for social reasons such as to see their friends and catch up on community news. Our Modern Orthodox synagogues were designed with Durkheim in mind. Here is an interesting thesis that the gen y is not leaving because of shallowness and hypocrisy but because they have an online community. The loss of third spaces is also relevant. The rise of religion in the last decades almost killed the Moose lodge, the Freemasons, and the bowling league. </p>
<blockquote><p>The difference between Generations X and Y isn&#8217;t in their views of the church. It&#8217;s about those cellphones. It&#8217;s about relationships and connectivity. Most Gen X&#8217;ers didn&#8217;t have cell phones, text messaging or Facebook. These things were creeping in during their college years but the explosive onset of mobile devices and social computing had yet to truly take off.</p>
<p>So why has mobile social computing affected church attendance? Well, if church has always been kind of lame and irritating why did people go in the first place? Easy, social relationships. Church has always been about social affiliation. You met your friends, discussed your week, talked football, shared information about good schools, talked local politics, got the scoop, and made social plans (&#8220;Let&#8217;s get together for dinner this week!&#8221;). Even if you hated church you could feel lonely without it. Particularly with the loss of &#8220;third places&#8221; in America.</p>
<p>But Millennials are in a different social situation. They don&#8217;t need physical locations for social affiliation. They can make dinner plans via text, cell phone call or Facebook. In short, the thing that kept young people going to church, despite their irritations, has been effectively replaced. </p>
<p><strong>Sure, Millennials will report that the &#8220;reason&#8221; they are leaving the church is due to its perceived hypocrisy or shallowness. My argument is that while this might be the proximate cause the more distal cause is social computing.</strong> Already connected Millennials have the luxury to kick the church to the curb. This is the position of strength that other generations did not have. We fussed about the church but, at the end of the day, you went to stay connected. For us, church was Facebook!</p>
<p>The pushback here will be that all this Millennial social computing, all this Facebooking, isn&#8217;t real, authentic relationship. I&#8217;d disagree with that assessment. It goes to the point I made earlier: Most of our Facebook interactions are with people we know, love, and are in daily contact with. <strong>Facebook isn&#8217;t replacing &#8220;real&#8221; relationships with &#8220;virtual&#8221; relationships. It&#8217;s simply connecting us to our real friends. And if you can do this without getting up early on Sunday morning why go to church? Particularly if the church is hypocritical and shallow? Why mess with it?</strong></p>
<p>Why are Millennials leaving the church? It&#8217;s simple. Mobile social computing has replaced the main draw of the traditional church: Social connection and affiliation.<br />
Here is the <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-facebook-killed-church.html">full post at Experimental Theology.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="http://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2011/02/is-facebook-killing-the-church.html">the h/t at Mirror of Justice,</a> which added:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the extent that this argument has merit, I&#8217;m guessing it holds more truth for Protestants than for Catholics.  In general, my experience of Protestant churches is that the churchgoing experience is more social, especially for young people, than the experience at most Catholic churches, where the experience is more centered on the individual, and where folks tend to flee as soon as Mass is finished (or sooner, in many cases)</p></blockquote>

				<p>Back in Sept, I announced <a href="../../../../2010/09/18/yair-sheleg-the-jewish-renaissance-in-israeli-society-the-emergence-of-a-new-jew/index.html">with a long blog post</a> the new book from Yair Sheleg, From Ancient Hebrew to New Jew: The Jewish Renaissance in Israeli Society.  Haaretz has a thoughtful review of the book by<br />
Hagai Dagan is the head of the department of Jewish thought at Sapir Academic College. Dagan finds himself stuck between the masses who prefer TV to spirituality and this elite that is highly individual. Dagan also notes the fundamentalism and delusions of changing the world resting not far below the surface. And to his credit Dagan also noted how similar this Sheleg is to Schweid&#8217;s vision of what would happen.</p>
<blockquote><p>although in some ways I am part of the Jewish renaissance described by Yair Sheleg in &#8220;From Ancient Hebrew to New Jew,&#8221; his book did not make me happy. The question is, why?</p>
<p>Sheleg divides this trend into two sub-trends: the cultural one, which is expressed principally through study of texts in different learning communities; and the spiritual one, which is expressed in various Jewish &#8220;New Age&#8221; dynamics, including neo-kabbala, neo-Hasidism and the coming-of-age route that leads from India to the Samarian hilltops. Both trends are distinguished from the familiar denominational frameworks existing here (Orthodoxy and the Reform and Masorti movements ), </p>
<p>Secular Jews, for their part, continue to maintain a secular lifestyle, but in their consciousness they are now more religious, Sheleg finds. These are not only people who are avowedly secular who are enriching their world with study of Jewish texts, but also secular &#8220;praying communities&#8221; that exist outside synagogues, and so on. In that sense, Eliezer Schweid&#8217;s diagnosis in his book &#8220;Judaism and Secular Culture&#8221; (published in Hebrew by Hakibbutz Hameuchad in 1981, but absent from Sheleg&#8217;s bibiliography ) is unfortunately coming true.</p>
<p>In Israeli society, and in the division it offers between cultural and spiritual people, the cultural group is more elitist, smaller in number and older, while the spiritual group represents a mass phenomenon.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the cultural-elitist trend stems from the fact that it remains limited to a small number of people, and is unable to offer a sufficiently attractive alternative to the entertainment offered on Channel 2 and Channel 10. The masses, in the final analysis, prefer the &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; reality TV show to the primeval Big Brother who emerges from the ancient pages of the Talmud. </p>
<p>The spiritual trend actually manages to attract masses of people, but just outside the door crouches the danger of religious-political fundamentalism, which develops out of a yearning for simplicity and a return to the mythical-primeval. </p>
<p>When he describes the neo-Bratslavers, for some reason it&#8217;s important to him to mention various jokes that have become connected to their mantra, &#8220;Na-Nah-Nahm-Nahman.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out, then, that Yair Sheleg sees our little Jewish renaissance as the starting point for a message for all of humanity. No less. By doing so he returns to the vision of Ahad Ha&#8217;am (Asher Ginsberg, a pre-state essayist and Zionist visionary ), who saw Israel as a spiritual center from which the Torah would go out to the entire world. </p>
<p>And now to return to the question with which I began. If the trend described by Sheleg is so good, why doesn&#8217;t it make me happy? The fact is that the processes discussed by Sheleg are taking place alongside a constant decline in the number of students of Jewish studies in academic institutions. Apparently people want Judaism for themselves, but are less interested in Torah or Jewish studies.<br />

				<p>In a prior post, I asked Jon the following questions. He never responded but I did receive the following from a reader for posting.</p>
<p><em>&gt;As a side question(s):What role does popular culture like heavy metal play in your life? How does it relate to your religiosity? How would you want educators and rabbi to treat, or relate to, your musical taste?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>My answer to your question is, in retrospect, quite a big one. I&#8217;ve loved music since I was a kid. I even remember exactly where I was and at what age when I discovered the Ramones; it was the beginning of July 1988, not yet 11 years old; I know this because it was on the Sunday of my sister&#8217;s shabbos sheva brachos, where we had gone to a hotel in the Catskill&#8217;s and there was a TV in the room. I saw the movie &#8220;Rock n&#8217; Roll High School.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through all this, I turned bar mitzvah, put on a black hat, went to [redacted yeshiva], where I stayed for 7 years, and lived a more or less double life. By day I was a yeshiva bochur, by nature fairly conforming, and by night I would hole up in the dormitory with my illegal walkman and listen to the very exciting early 90s music scene. I must stress, again, that I was a sincere and decent yeshiva bochur. I woke up, went to minyan, davened sincerely, learned Gemara, Rashi and Tosfos yeshivish style. I just happened to love rock and roll. By the time I was 17 or 18 I had developed a real tayva to see bands, and I began to secretly go to concerts (sometimes with friends from within the yeshiva &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t the only one &#8211; and without). </p>
<p>I actually have an awesome memory from 1997 or 1998, which was right at the start of Williamsburg becoming a hipster scene. Until that point I had only been going to shows in Manhattan, at the Academy, Roseland Ballroom, or if I was in a sleazier (and cheaper) mood, at CBGBs, the Continental and Coney Island High (of these only Roseland and the Continental are still open &#8211; I feel old). But on this occasion I went to see Sonic Youth performing somewhere in Williamsburg, which at the time meant only Chassidim and Puerto Ricans to me. I remember milling around in the room, and all of a sudden &#8211; I made eye contact with a guy I know only by face, who was in my yeshiva too. He must have been about 27 or 28. Perhaps a BT? But the thing is, I was wearing a baseball cap (yeah, of course I looked like a yeshiva bochur in a baseball cap) and he had a beard, peyos, and a yarmulke, in this crowd of proto-hipsters (people were still wearing flannel then). We both stared at each other, probably thinking &#8220;Oh, crap.&#8221; I had never come across anything like it. I didn&#8217;t know the guy before, and I didn&#8217;t know him afterward.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah &#8211; I grew out of being yeshivish and am still Orthodox, at least theoretically. I&#8217;m fairly observant, and I sure do learn a lot. But having years of reflecting on it, I realize that my great love for rock and roll played no small role in my evolution, because it was a constant, graphic proof to myself that I was incapable of swallowing the dogma wholeheartedly. I really, really tried to. I even have a specific memory &#8211; a funeral of all places &#8211; of being part of a crowd of hundreds of guys wearing black hats, and feeling almost euphoric. It felt like being a part of Something. I really tried to be a good yeshiva guy, and to grow up to be a good yeshiva man. But this slight deviation was a wedge and opened the door fairly wide. I&#8217;m sure of it. I guess my choice was to consider myself a mumar leteyavon, or refuse to see that what I was interested in was really no different from eating a cheeseburger. This was a patent disagreement with the rabbis, was it not? I was allowing myself this, and there went yeshivish Orthodoxy for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not think that the same would have occurred at YU. There seems to be a greater taking pop culture with ease. People do go to rock concerts without loss of faith. YU produced bands that imitate Coldplay and Green Day. They see less of the tensions and contradictions. This may be a real dividing line between Yeshivot and YU. Some at YU may have compunctions and feel it is entirely treif but the community as a whole does not. YU baby booomers still rock to Springsteen&#8217;s concerts. There was a culture of rock around the station WYUR and Vin Scelsa&#8217;s first hero of rock was a YU student. Now, there are even rock and roll shabbatot. For public performance, the lyrics are cleaned up but the original watching of gangsta videos to produce a clean version occurs naturally.</p>
<p>I also feel that some of my posts are getting sucked into the loss of faith confessional vortex of this era. It seems the web pulls one in. I do not get long emails on my posts about Maimonides or Zohar.<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Certeau">Michel de Certeau</a> (d. 1986) was Jesuit monk, historian and philosopher whose work is essential for conceptualizing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life">religion within everyday life.</a> His scholarship on mysticism and religious polemics offers some of the most fruitful for understanding of Hasidism, Mitnagdim, and Neo-Hasidism, or the in-between groups within Orthodoxy. I will limit my discussion here to those points important for the understanding of popular culture.  </p>
<p>In one of his talks given to an intellectual group of clergy debating ideological issues of the age, a European Catholic version of the Orthodox Forum, where the debate was how much pluralism can the unified teachings of the Church bear? As in the Jewish community, the papers addressed the matter from the perspective of liberal and conservative, specifically how to increase pluralism within the Church or how to set limits to the pluralism? Certeau undercut the discussion of the forum by arguing that pluralism is everywhere. Everything that goes on in the practice of everyday life is interpreted differently by everyone—the fishmonger and the lawyer, the bishop and the doctor, all people hear things differently.  The average person, the teenager, the householder, the senior citizen, the high school teacher, the doctor, and the lawyer each create their own version of the Church’s teaching.  </p>
<p>To apply this to the case of the Orthodoxy, Certeau would emphasize how Rav Soloveitchik means different things to different people. Most of us are used to the debates about Rav Soloveitchik and revisionism, situating the diversity on a left and right spectrum. Certeau would undercut this and looks at the reception of Rav Soloveitchik from a real life perspective. </p>
<p>To illustrate, I will take a real life example, a local New York high school gave its students a short essay written by Rav Soloveitchik on the axiological importance of Torah study in our lives. As homework, they had to answer questions about how to apply that essay within their lives.  So, one student, showing commitment to Torah study, started to paint signs for his youth group, another spent time each day on AskMoses the Chabad question and answer site, another studied with diligence Akiva Tatz’s books, another read frum message boards on the web, one downloaded Torah shiurim on mp3’s, and another worked on a video for their NCSY region, others spent extra time on their Navi class where literary approaches to the chapter were emphasized. None of this plurality relates to the left-right divide or can be directly found in Rav Soloveitchik’s words.</p>
<p>According to Certeau, the religious person can cull the products of the  community and adapt it to her own life and worldview, thereby Rav Soloveitchik can be combined with the twelve steps, kiruv, neo-hasidism, sports, and be seen to support Artscroll, Hatam Sofer, Kahanaism, and the internet.</p>
<p>For Certeau, the understanding of culture is the understanding of consumers and how they poach. Culture is also about the operational logic of disguise and survival against a background of obligation and orthodoxy. Certeau is interested in how we use objects—not how the original intent for which they were created for to us.  For instance, Certeau is interested in how people buy books just to have them on the shelf, or to make a polemic point, or to show allegiance. How people misquote them just as much as what it says in the book. Do we give the object privileged space?  Do they subvert their meanings?  A common practice is to harmonize the given book with whatever a person is  actually interested in or actually uses in her life.</p>
<p>When Certeau looks at everyday life, he looks at activities of resistance and evasion and how people resist under the radar by means of tactics.  An example of a tactic might be something as mundane as using office supplies for personal purposes or IMing at work.  They are committed to work but their heart and mind are elsewhere. </p>
<p>In Certeau’s gaze, he would see students who may be committed to study Talmud yet are successful at evasion of the very activity to which they claim to be devoting  their efforts. They may start the morning learning by talking about their dates, the entertainment they recently attended, and sports scores. They also know that if they play along enough to cover the Gemara, they will be left alone to deal with their own path where they can concentrate on Neo-Haisdut, kiruv, current events, the seforim sale, or the MCATS. They can spend seder uploading to the web reverential pictures of the roshei yeshiva, sending Twitter messages about what they are currently learning, or collecting all the political and polemical comments made by the Rosh Yeshiva. They can reminisce about the popular culture experience of the gap year in Israel. Or they can enter into a language weave of steig and stark by focusing on how they dress, their props, and the books on their shelves, rather than the content of the Talmud.  Each of these is a tactic of evasion that simultaneously evades and supports the system.</p>
<p>These activities have no clear authority or no proper location.  Rather, they are opportunistic moments that we use to construct our days that let us survive.  According to Certeau, all institutions, books, and ideas are now conversations and everyday practices.  Certeau focus on space, not time or ideas, to explain everyday life.  He uses the metaphor of the fishwife going to market and walking through the streets of Paris in order to opt out of the grand metaphors about history, ideas, and social change. For Certeau, everything is a network and everything has potential to contradict everything else without upsetting the public confession.   </p>
<p>There are a variety of sources of knowledge that continuously undercut the main narrative. Certeau makes the point that the ideas get played out so radically different in the real life that it becomes hard to talk about the ideas. Every work has multiple receptions in society that are incorrigible. Storytellers have no power in the hierarchical religious system, but they gain authority that people use in their personal narratives.  Other tactics to undermine include calling something a “secret” because secret knowledge gives us status, this works also for religious experience.  Singularity is also a good tactic—if you make something “different” then you can opt out as well.  Mystics and pietists are masters of this. Hecklers have amazing authority without power.  </p>
<p>In his theory, it is important to note when the personal overrides the supposed orthodoxy. Someone may have heard a rabbi give a proper lecture on a topic but a story by lay preacher or a Neo-Hasidic tale may speak to their personal narrative in a stronger way and the religious person lets the story overrides the formal teaching. If asked if one followers a Rosh Yeshivah, a person can give a resounding 100% “yes” answer of obedience. But Certeau would observe when you discuss the details with the person they may give complete deference to the personal meanderings including what he reads on a blog, a weird singular halakhic opinion they once heard, his high school rebbe, Artscroll, his NCSY advisor, or something in the name of Rav Moshe Wolfson. In all of these cases, there was no rationalization for the contradictory harmonization but natural evasions that create their own authority. In addition, Certeau shows that when a religious person is asked about compliance with a religious principle they may also refer to a different question, the way he is dressed, a class he attended, an event in the news, something he just read, tell a story and never return to the original question. </p>
<p>From Certeau’s ground level vantage point, high culture reveals itself as subject to the same cultural forces as popular culture. Ideological products become excorporated into daily life, meaning incorporated along with the distortions and evasions generated by fears, desires, distortions, pragmatic decisions, and misreadings of daily life. Popular culture is the paradigm by which people can deal with high culture products that are out-dated, oppressive, or out of touch with experiences or aspirations.</p>
