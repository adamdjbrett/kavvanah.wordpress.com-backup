The second is the liberal American Catholic perspective of recognizing Judaism also acknowledges a radical change to viewing Judaism as a continuous covenant but points in the opposite direction that the Church should recognize Judaism as unique, preferably as an independent Mosaic covenant with God.</p>

L&#8217;Osservatore Romano: For the Pope, [the Jews are] not &#8220;elder brothers&#8221; but &#8220;fathers in the faith&#8221;<br />
ASCA / Vatican City, January 15: In his interview-book &#8220;The Light of the World,&#8221; Pope Benedict XVI &#8220;re-examines the older definition of the Jews as &#8216;elder brothers&#8217; and links it to his own expression, <strong>&#8216;fathers in the faith,&#8217; which, he contends, explains even better the relationship between Jews and Christians.&#8221; This is what was stated in an article published today in L&#8217;Osservatore Romano by Father Norbert J. Hofmann</strong>, the secretary of the Commission for Religious Relations with Judaism.</p>
<p>The Vatican&#8217;s point-man for dialogue with the Jews explains: &#8220;John Paul II, during his historic visit of April 13, 1985 to the Synagogue of Rome, addressed the Jews as &#8216;specially beloved brothers,&#8217; as &#8216;elder brothers&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, on the Jewish side, several voices had criticized this new definition. In fact, in the Bible, the elder brother doesn&#8217;t always come off best; it is sufficient to recall the example of Jacob and Esau, where it is precisely the elder brother who is not chosen&#8221;. <strong>As Hofmann explains, &#8220;Benedict XVI has demonstrated [his] sensitivity in the face of such criticisms, preferring to opt for the term &#8216;fathers in the faith&#8217;.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This concerns an expression which &#8220;clearly recalls the Jewish roots of Christianity and, thus, the fact that, as Christians, we have inherited from our &#8216;Jewish fathers&#8217; faith in the one God of Israel, and we share in common with them the same religious tradition, even if we interpret it in a new and different way, in light of the Christian event. As Christians, we have in Christ a different image of the Jewish &#8216;motherland,&#8217; from which we ourselves have been born.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="http://www.sju.edu/academics/centers/ijcr/archives/2010Jan11.html">a statement of St Joseph&#8217;s University</a> honoring Cardinal Kasper, Fr Nobert Hofmann&#8217;s former theological superior. </p>
<blockquote><p>    * Your insistence that after Nostra Aetate, &#8220;the way Christians look at Jews has changed radically&#8221; because &#8220;the old theory of substitution is gone since II Vatican Council.&#8221; Demonstrating the frank honesty of an authentic scholar, you have observed that &#8220;the most important spiritual and ethical impulse for &#8230; the revolutionary shift of the relations between Jews and Christians was the horrors of the Holocaust.&#8221;</p>
<p>    * Flowing from Nostra Aetate, you have also consistently stressed the uniqueness of the Church&#8217;s relationship with Judaism and the Jewish people. &#8220;Judaism is not one religion among the non-Christian religions,&#8221; you have written. &#8220;Christianity has a particular and a unique relation with Judaism. We cannot define Christianity and its identity without making reference to Judaism.&#8221; </p>
<p>    * You have frequently stressed that &#8220;God&#8217;s Covenant with Israel has not simply been replaced by the new Covenant. God &#8230; has not repudiated and forsaken his people. Israel is still God&#8217;s partner. God is still devoted to his people with love and loyalty, mercy, justice and pardon; God is always with his people especially in the most difficult moments of history. Every Jew, as one of His people, lives in promise.&#8221;  Moreover, you have drawn out the implications of this conviction: &#8220;So from the Christian perspective the covenant with the Jewish people is unbroken (Rom 11,29), for we as Christians believe that these promises find in Jesus their definitive and irrevocable Amen (2 Cor 1,20) and at the same time that in him, who is the end of the law (Rom 10,4), the law is not nullified but upheld (Rom 3,31). This does not mean that Jews in order to be saved have to become Christians; if they follow their own conscience and believe in God&#8217;s promises as they understand them in their religious tradition they are in line with God&#8217;s plan, which for us comes to its historical completion in Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>    * &#8220;In the end,&#8221; you have written, &#8220;the relationship of Israel and the church is a mystery of election and judgment, of guilt and even greater grace, which Paul is able to approach only with doxology (cf. Rom 11:33-36). The continuing existence of Israel confronts us [Christians] inevitably with God&#8217;s unconditional faithfulness to his people. The existence of the church is also a mystery, for without deserving it, out of pure grace, God&#8217;s covenant commitment has been extended to the Gentiles. So the relationship of Israel and the church is an absolute mystery. &#8221;</p>
<p>    * Finally, your dedication to pursuing these challenging topics has prompted you to support relevant sustained academic research. One example of this has been your consistent encouragement of the work of a transatlantic team of scholars, culminating in the important foreword you have authored for their forthcoming book, Christ Jesus and the Jewish People Today: New Explorations of Theological Interrelationships.  Your support has been edifying for everyone involved.</p></blockquote>

				<p> Murdoch&#8217;s new paper The Daily has an article on Amish breaking the law by transporting unpasteurized milk across state lines. <a href="http://www.getreligion.org/2011/02/ipad-publication-meets-the-amish/">GetRelgion takes the story apart</a> but the interesting punchline is that the farmer is breaking the US law in order to preserve his religious life. Hmm&#8230; Why the parallel form of thinking between sectarian Jews and sectarian Christians? It seems to be a common effect of locating all value within one&#8217;s own community.</p>
<blockquote><p> Samuel is part of a shadowy community of outlaw Amish and Mennonite dairy farmers who risk fines, loss of equipment and product, and even imprisonment to transport raw milk across state lines and satisfy a burgeoning appetite for illegal raw milk in places like New York. In January, The Daily rode along on one of these smuggling runs.</p>
<p>    Unpasteurized milk is increasingly popular among foodies and health nuts for both its taste and its supposed nutritional benefits. But government authorities take a hard line, warning that unpasteurized milk may contain salmonella, E. coli and bacteria that can lead to typhoid fever and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>    “Raw milk is inherently dangerous and it should not be consumed by anyone at any time for any purpose,” says the Food and Drug Administration.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When he brings a shipment of illegal milk to New York,  Samuel has more than 140 customers waiting for him, ready to pay $6 a  gallon.<br />
Samuel’s smuggling run started in Pennsylvania’s Amish country, where  his family farm is located. As Amish doctrine prohibits him from  operating an automobile, he paid a non-Amish person to drive.</p>
<p>Samuel is well-aware that he’s breaking the law.<br />
<strong>OK … he won’t drive a car, but he’ll break federal law? Why?</strong> How does  smuggling raw milk fit with his personal values? The story doesn’t say.</p>
<p>Isaac, another Amish farmer who agreed to be interviewed if the  publication kept his identity confidential, offers this perspective:<br />
For Isaac, the issues are cultural. <strong>When it comes to  dairy farming, becoming a smuggler was the only way to maintain a pure,  Amish way of life. “I want my family on the farm,” he said. “I don’t  want them out in the world.”</strong></p>
<p>He wouldn’t be able to make ends meet in his traditional dairy  operation if he was operating above board, he said. “We have church  restrictions, and our people are losing that because of the way modern  dairy farming is being done.”</p>
<p>He wondered aloud why the state won’t let him pursue his preferred  way of life.<br />
But what does his religion say about breaking the law? Would God  approve of what he’s doing? The story fails to tackle such basic  questions.</p></blockquote>

				<p>There is a diary of the court of the current Talner Rebbe that has appeared on the web with the title of Tolner Wikilinks. It was likely taken or stolen from the computer of one the aides of the Rebbe or from someone inside of the court. Most of it concerns the recent courts of Reb Pinches Menachem and Reb Yitzchok Menachem Weinberg, today&#8217;s Tolner Rebbe of Bayit Vegan. The former was the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rabbi-pinchas-menachem-alter-1341547.html">powerful and politicaly active Gerrer rebbe who died in 1996.</a></p>
<p>It is a journal-pinkas of 492 typed pages in Hebrew and Yiddish of the last 20 years and includes reactions to people, weddings, current events as well as visits to the doctor. It opens with stories and then moves on to more personal material.But even then the editor mixed past and present. It includes a pinkas of those who came for yehidus, the etzah and the pidyan as well as who got to sit at a tisch. It is as close as most people will ever get to the inside working of a hasidic court. Once digested will likely generate op-eds, articles and certainly the possibility for a book on contemporary Hasidism using this as a basis. </p>
<p>There are Brisk stories, stories of Rav Menachem Zemba, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Holocaust stories,and many other stories. Some of the stories about decades ago are clearly anachronistic, the recent stories are the gems. The Hasidic blogs will likely pick out the gossip first, then name calling and <a href="http:///www.scribd.com/doc/47828620/יומן-טאלנא-הפני-מנחם-נגד-הבעלזר">petty comments about Belz</a>, Slonim, Satmar, Viznitz, and Gur as well as the visit by Gutnik. I am most interested in the actual content. </p>
<p>Here is the leaked <a href='https://kavvanah.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/48071342-d799d795d79ed7a0d799-d798d790d79cd7a0d790.pdf'>Talner Diary</a> as a large pdf file.</p>
<p>I skimmed its almost 500 pages and here are a few random items that caught my eye.  If you find important parts then please let me know in the comments. Also if important discussions start on Hyde Park or on other blogs then please let me know.<br />
To give you a sample:<br />
1] There is a conversation between the two aforementioned rebbes about the Jerusalem trend of graphology and does it work?<br />
2] We have a discussion on the need to learn ibn Ezra.<br />
3] We have Hasidim coming for advise to recoup losses from an American bank scheme.<br />
4] We have a steady stream of bachrim and young avrachim asking for a tikkun for an averah. To one he says, &#8220;learn for 5 hours straight.&#8221; The bachur says that would go over seder time so he cant, to which the rebbe answers that if one has enough effort then ordinary seder will count as 5 hrs.<br />
He told another to seek truth like Kotzk, to which the avrach said that is above his level. So instead he was told to learn half a day and to guard his eyes the other half.<br />
Another came in asking for help in his avodah and he was told to take everything easy and to go on a diet.<br />
A group of  avrachim asked to go on a trip to the Golan, he told them to act appropriately and to remember God at all times &#8220;when you go on your ways.&#8221; Same advice was given to group heading up to Meron.<br />
He refused pidyon money from Avrachim.<br />
5] We have him keeping Rav Hayyim Druckman waiting for a yehidus since Druckman wanted greater support for Yesha and the settlements and the rebbe did not want more of this avodah zara.<br />
He leaves town for a day when there was a gush emunim rally.<br />
6] We have an 18th century mocking of his doctors. He went to an eye doctor erev Sukkot and his vision improved, to which he attributes to the power of the Sukkah.<br />
He another time he went to visit the Professor- Doctor and the doctor complained about Rav Getz calling the police on the woman&#8217;s group at the Kotel. To which Professor-Doctor #2 said it is because of the prohibition of a woman&#8217;s voice. Doctor #1 said he listened to a woman&#8217;s voice many many times and it has never bothered him. And then the Rebbe said it is like the peasant who walks barefoot with rocks compared to the sophisticated European, who is elevated and greater than the peasant, who cannot tolerate a little pebble in his shoe, so too here. At this the doctor praised his amazing wisdom.<br />
7] We have a case where someone lied to get a pre-wedding berachah and now came to admit lying and get a real berakhah.<br />
8] We have a story of ideology about not reaching out to common people. The Besht reached out to common people and was not able to create a court, but Kotzk threw people out and it created Gur.<br />
9] It is better to have a marriage with the son of a heretic than a son of mumar leteavon, because the latter leaves a lasting bad virtue.<br />
10] We have a bachur coming for advice what to do since his mother is not Jewish. He was told just keep the 7 mizvot and not to try for more. [I assume it was a conversion question]<br />
11] We have a miracle tale of causing the Petah Tikvah movie theater that was open on Shabbat to close permanently.<br />
12] They have an suspicion of the Israeli government officials and at the same time claiming credit for themselves. For example, they have a minhag to say shem reshaim yirkov about Mt Herzl. But they claim credit for the Yom Kippur War victory.<br />
13] He visited his son on his birthday and brought a present and said that there are also tikkunim on a birthday.<br />
14] The essence of Hasidut is obedience tot he rebbe as we know from Mordechai giving Esther instructions. (This drashah is usually cited for Rav Elhanan Wasserman&#8217;s daas Torah)<br />
15] When Reb Pinches Menachem heard that there is kolel for baalei teshuvah, he exclaimed &#8221; who took this upon themselves to create this ..they should work and only have fixed times for Torah.&#8221;<br />
16] When asked by an avrach who had many preparations for prayer and prayed for a long time, the rebbe told him to stop it is not for our generation.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In the current issue of <a href="http://www.v-catalog.com/accounts/HartmanShalom/comments.php?publication=3">Havruta,</a>Professor Moshe Idel defines Orthodoxy and gives his view of the principles of Judaism. For Idel, the Talmud has theological points but focuses mainly on practice. Idel points to three subsequent approaches to the principles of faith. The first is that of medieval philosophers and kabbalists who created an intellectual religion subject to debate within and without Judaism. His is lumping together with Maimondies everyone from Gersonides, Abulafia, Ibn Ezra, Gikkitila, and Alemano.<br />
The second  is that of modern liberal Judaism who rest everything on the single principle of ethical monotheism and to be a light to the nations.<br />
The third approach is that of Orthodoxy, then and now, which denies the ability to make evaluative judgments or create hierarchies.  Even thing is holy and required , so nothing can be justified internally or to the outside world. He assumes that the first group won.</p>
<p>So is Idel insightful  or missing the mark?<br />
I ask because Moshe Idel is not catching on with the popular psyche of American Jews.  It is not just because his books are difficult and filled with unexplained quotes, rather there are theological reasons. Scholem’s counter history of myth and symbol was loved by everyone. Kabbalah became Scholem’s theory of symbols. Idel’s  enchanted chains, absorbed perfections, hieroglyphics, and magical rabbis does not strike the same cord.<br />
To return to this case at hand the principles of Judaism. We understand when Arthur Green says the principles are passé and Danny Landes defends them. We understand when Orthodox Jews define the principles with ahistoric presentism and ignore the historic variety of interpretations and the response.<br />
But do we recognize Idel’s conception of Orthodoxy defined as action-centered with a lack of the ability to make distinctions and evaluations as the community of Orthodoxy? And if we do, is this an original insight or old hat?</p>
<p><em>In the classical Judaism of the Bible and of the rabbis there is no such concept as ikkarim.</p>
<p>Starting with Maimonides in the Middle Ages, we encounter the enumeration of ikkarim as the main precepts of Judaism,..</p>
<p>This move marks a large leap from a performative approach &#8211; whereby religious life is defined by the way we practice it &#8211; to a new, more theoretical approach whereby faith is defined by the way we think about it  Maimonides did not take this leap alone: he was part of an elite that sought to transcend halacha centered Judaism in a manner that confers a much greater role to intellectual processes than previously allowed. In attempting to formulate principles for a religion that was originally based only on practice, this elite tried to establish propositions that can be explained and debated both within and outside the Jewish faith. </p>
<p>A representative of both the rabbinical and mystical approaches is Rabbi David ben Shlomo ibn Zimra, known as Radbaz (1479- 1573). An important halachist, leader of the Jewish community in Egypt, and a learned mystic who probably initiated the famous Ari (Rabbi Yitzhak Luria) to the secrets of Kabbalah, Radbaz dismissed the whole idea of ikkarim, which, in his view, ran counter to the Torah, the bedrock of Jewish faith:</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot agree with [a move to] impose upon our perfect Torah any ikkar or other, for it is all an ikkar [emanating] from the mouth of God … each and every mitzvah is an ikkar and cornerstone [of our faith] and you may find a mitzvah that seems marginal, when in fact the reason it was commanded and the secrets it contains are beyond our comprehension (She’elot ve-Teshuvot HaRadbaz, Responsum 344).</p></blockquote>
<p>Radbaz makes two strong claims. First, the Torah is a perfect whole, and its perfection is tainted by the attempt to focus on some of its teachings while marginalizing others. Second, there is no way for us to discern any hierarchy in the divine commandments, because we can grasp neither the “external” justification for their practice, nor their “internal” mystical essence. Therefore, according to him, we must perform all of the commandments with equal devotion and refrain from taking liberties in assigning different degrees of importance to them. <strong>This approach of the Radbaz remains normative in Orthodoxy.</strong></p>
<p>But there are also traditions within Judaism that take a somewhat more universalistic approach and regard religious speculation as a higher value than religious performance The most radical manifestation of this development is the assumption that Judaism can be summarized as ethical monotheism, and that Jews were the people chosen to disseminate this one important religious insight to the whole of humanity. </p>
<p>There is more than one irony here. In seeking to shed all the religious obligations of Judaism… with one big thing that may be harder to live up to than all the 613 commandments combined.</p>
<p>In the end, the winner is Maimonides, whose thirteen ikkarim, distilled into the Yigdal hymn, are sung every Shabbat by Jews all over the world, Orthodox and liberal alike, who may or may not be aware of the ultimate significance of the ikkarim.</em></p>

				<p>I sat next to someone recently who told me that they loved the stories of Hanoch Teller. Since he was very far from our projected image of Teller’s audience, I asked him: what other books does he likes? What has he read recently that was similar? He answered that he loved the recent Keith Richard’s autobiography. In both cases, what mattered was the human narrative and how the people responded to life. In neither case, did the protagonist have a heroic change or a transformation, just little moments of everyday life. He volunteered that he also liked the stories of Studs Turkel. This human narrative was the rubric for his religion.  </p>
<p>This human narrative is also the rubric for the Oprah Winfey show, The role of this narrative theology is the subject of a recent academic work Kathryn Lofton&#8217;s <em><a href="http:///www.amazon.com/Oprah-Gospel-Icon-Kathryn-Lofton/dp/0520267524"><strong>Oprah: The Gospel of an Icon</strong></a></em>(<a href="http://http/www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520267527">University of California Press, 2011</a>). Lofton, a scholar of religion is interested in the religious views of the show.  Oprah is not interested in abstract knowledge or knowledge that does not relate to one’s life. All books that one reads have to fit into the “first-person journey of my life.” How does that book make a better me or a vision of an alternate reality? </p>
<p>And this dovetails with my current looking at the role of popular culture in the Centrist community. Popular culture plays an increased role in Orthodoxy because one needs products that relate to the first person journey of one’s life. Talmud study, halakhah, and philosophy do not deal with the individual. The huge amount of Neo-Hasidism, self-help, evangelical  purpose-driven Orthodoxy, and narrative books are all needed to offer suggestions of a better self or an alternate reality.  Rav Sooveitchik is not filtering down through his students and transforming the popular worldview of suburbia, rather the religious teachings of Oprah (and other popular teachers) are filtering down and the world of Orthodoxy is being transformed into Oprah. Halakhah will somehow gain a self-improvement packaging to compete.</p>
<p>Oprah creates a social ethos where people think they are part of a tight knit group even though they have less actual connection. She holds the model for bringing religion into the social network age.  If everyone is reading the same book and posting on the same message board and feeling they are telling their story they feel a personal social connection. She praises her followers for their forming bonds and people want the praise. Oprah is against institutional religion and has spirituality outside institutions, but in a way that followers see her supporting traditional values. She has an online institution. Some of the media based forms of Orthodoxy will grow at the expense of the local version, Chabad and Aish come to mind, but there will be greater forms of Orthodoxy by media connection. Don’t think in linear terms of a web site that will discuss halakhah as much as an online community that offers the feeling that one has a God given means of self improvement and first person journey’s that can only be found in Orthodoxy. </p>
<p>Oprah’s religion postulates a daily life of a false self having to make pragmatic decisions and a true inner self that possesses infinite potential for solving problems, creativity, and individuality. The religion of Oprah promises you the oxymoron of instructions for personal creativity and how precious is each person’s story. It is not that one is promised a better marriage, better children, better health, and richer life in an ordinary prosperity gospel sense but that the true self, the inner self, the inner spirit needs to grow.  I do think that much of the new expansive “Eyn Od Milvado”  and cruise ship Centrism is heading in this direction.  As well as those recent works on Hashem having a plan for all of us to personally actualize. At some point, it will clash with the top-down teachings of following a Rosh Yeshiva.Living for personal insight and the higher self is not the same Orthodoxy as submission to the halakhah. In the meantime, the writing of self-help books has moved from the Engaged Yeshivish community to the Centrist community.  I noticed several new life cycle books that seem to go in this direction, but I do not own them to analyze them.</p>
<p>The inner self  is know through commercial commodity products. Lofton Shows how the inner self is pre-packaged as ready to buy units. They pre-package the statement that people are not alone in their problems and they can buy into solidarity with others in similar situations. </p>
<p>I loved the fact that Lofton was self aware that she came to this through ironic application of high theory to TV and stayed to write a book when she saw that Oprah was a great test case for theories of religion.  I think that she has a virtue over the academic students of Hasidut who are not self-aware  and do not see where they fit into the applied real world of new-age, spirituality, popular religion. A reader of Hasidut who watches Oprah will differ from someone who reads the same passage of Hasidut and listens to Evangelicals or Keith Richards. <strong>Any further thoughts on Oprah and Orthodoxy??</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>From an interview on the <a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2011/01/26/what-is-oprah-an-interview-with-kathryn-lofton/">Immanent Frame </a><br />
NS: What would Oprah think of your book?<br />
KL: This is not the sort of book she reads—or, rather, this is not the sort of book that the product Oprah endorses—since it neither prescribes a better reality nor posits an alternative reality to which you could escape.  If she and I were talking, though, the first thing she’d want to know is how this book fit into the first-person journey of my life. Then I’d find myself quickly formatted into her production as a signifying woman of one sort or another. This is her real legacy. After Oprah, what first-person iteration is not a commodity?</p>
<p>NS: As an American woman, do you feel some responsibility to confront what Oprah represents, in the form of an active, engaged social critique?<br />
KL: The social is incredibly absent from Oprah, even as she praises the idea of girlfriends, of groups, of clubs. The social is a rhetorical formulation leaving women exposed in their extremity without any public held accountable.<br />
“Girls, I’ll guide you to your total originality.” </p>
<p>KL: Oprah is a passionate advocate for a kind of prosperity gospel, insofar as she believes in a correlative relationship between one’s disposition and one’s materiality</p>
<p>NS: So all else becomes subservient to the commercial?<br />
KL: Her reply would be that, no, all else becomes subservient to the spirit. The first question everyone should ask is, “What is my spirit telling me to do?” How do you tap into your spirit? How do you re-enchant your spirit after being pulled upon, tugged upon, by the false pragmatism of men, family, work? The replies to that are frequently flattered by the commercial, but not solely comprised of it.</p>
<p>NS: Tell me about what brought you to the study of Oprah. Was it fandom, or irony, or what?<br />
KL: Undergraduate irony. As a student at the University of Chicago, my dorm had a communal room with a television, and Oprah repeated late at night on the local ABC affiliate. I would be sitting with a group of friends who were, because of the Common Core, all reading the same high-brow social and political theory and applying it colloquially to The Real World:<br />
As I began to teach courses in religious studies, I found she was a great way to test theories of myth, ideology, and ritual for students new to religious studies abstractions. So, since the early nineties, I haven’t been able to get her out of my head—she seemed pervasive in the world and persuasively central to any given narrative of the West.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I once was stuck in a slow elevator and was asked by my fellow traveler for some seasonal Torah. I proffered a thought from Maharal developed by a <em>Kedushat Levi</em>. When I was done, the person said with dismay that they are not our mesorah (tradition) and instead he recited a third-hand insight of Soren Kierkegaard as the true Rav Soloveitchik tradition (<em>mesorah</em>). Centrist Orthodoxy has invested much in its incorporation of Kierkegaard’s theology of submission, sacrifice, and absurdity. Modern Jewish thought has been willing to override Rabbinic readings of the Bible to affirm those of Kierkegaard. Repeated essays by Milton Steinberg, Louis Jacobs, Emil Fackenheim and Jon Levenson as well as statements by Walter Wurzburger and others did little to divest Orthodoxy of its Lutheran moorings. In general, modern Jewish thought has taken a liking to Kierkegaard when compared to its use of other modern thinkers. </p>
<p>However, all this may change soon. Last year there was a new book in Danish by Peter Tudvad <em>Stadier paa Antisemitisms Vej: Søren Kierkegaard og Jøderne (Stages on the Way of Antisemitism: Søren Kierkegaard and the Jews)</em> (Rosinante, 2010). The book has elicited controversy and as of December 2010 has had approximately 90 articles published in the Danish media on the book, some of which appeared even before the book itself. This controversy has yet to make it into the American Jewish media and I only found out about it on an academic philosophy list. You are getting it first. </p>
<p>The Danes have been portrayed as non-antisemitic because they kept the Holocaust out of Denmark. But Peter Tudvad&#8217;s book includes a broad survey of antisemitism in Denmark especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep-Hep_riots">1819 Hep Hep riots</a> against the Jews.  &#8220;We had one, a pogrom, in Denmark in 1819 too, which was so severe that the king had to declare Copenhagen, his capital, in a state of emergency. The city was under a curfew for several weeks, and the military patrolled the streets of Copenhagen.&#8221; The new book shows that Kierkegaard was heir to the inherited Danish economic and social antisemitism as well as Lutheran theological antisemitism. Danish scholars have been quick to defend Danish honor by claiming that Kierkegaard was typical for his age without dealing with all of Tudvad&#8217;s evidence. </p>
<p>To document this controversy the Kierkegaard scholar M.G. Piety, associate professor of philosophy at Drexel University in Philadelphia has created a blog called <a href="http:///pietyonkierkegaard.com/">“Piety on Kierkegaard.”</a> The blog is sporadic and it has taken her two months to provide enough information for me to post a decent blog post. (I wanted to post as soon as I found out about the book but her blog still did not have enough information.) For the most important posts, see <a href="http://pietyonkierkegaard.com/2010/12/">here </a>and <a href="http://pietyonkierkegaard.com/2011/01/25/tudvad-interview-part-2/">here</a> and <a href="http://pietyonkierkegaard.com/2011/01/28/tudvad-interview-conclusion/">here. </a></p>
<p>Piety offers an interview with the Peter Tudvad, the author of the controversial book. Here are some excerpts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Piety: Not much is known in the English-speaking world about the controversy over your new book. Can you give a brief summary of it?</p>
<p>Tudvad: That might be difficult as the row lasted for about two months, and was very intense. A newspaper, Berlingske Tidende, published an interview with me about three weeks before the book was actually published. The reporter was shocked by the quotations I had included in the preface, which I let him see, such as Kierkegaard writing that <strong>the Jews were typically usurers and as such bloodthirsty, that they had a penchant for money (due to an abstract character, as Kierkegaard supposes), and that they dominated the Christians. </strong><br />
As I told the reporter, <strong>Kierkegaard was of the opinion that the Jews would eventually kill the European Christians – something which he wrote in an entry in his diary, but which was omitted from the Hong’s translation,</strong> I guess on purpose – and that they had an extraordinary sexual appetite and thus many children. They were, according to Kierkegaard, mundane and had no real spirit, no quest for the eternal bliss.</p>
<p>the reason that we have seldom discussed this aspect of his theology might be that we were afraid of damaging his image, his reputation, thus losing the prostrate respect many have for one of the few internationally renowned Danish authors. </p>
<p>His diaries have always been considered a key to the understanding of his published works, so if one, for example, with the help of his entries can link his antisemitisme with his theology, and vice versa, I think we really ought to discuss the problem seriously</p>
<p>Piety: <strong>Do you think Kierkegaard was anti-Semitic? If so, in what sense?</strong></p>
<p>Tudvad: Yes, I do. Sure he was not a kind of anti-Semite as the Nazis. He hated any kind of collectivism, and he would certainly not have participated in the pogrom in 1938. Nevertheless, I published my book on November 9, i.e. on the anniversary of the Kristallnacht in 1938, but my point was, that anti-Semitism and pogroms are not exclusively a German phenomenon. </p>
<p>My point is, that Danes are not less disposed to anti-Semitism than Germans, Poles, Russians or any other peoples, and that words are not harmless. So, <strong>Kierkegaard’s words are not harmless either. Some Danish Nazis actually referred to him in 1940 as their ally against the Jews.</strong></p>
<p>Piety: The English theologian George Pattison actually admitted in his article “Søren Kierkegaard was neither better nor worse than his times” that he had not read your book. Is that right?</p>
<p>Tudvad: Yes. – ”Neither better nor worse!” He was surely not worse than some people, and surely not better than quite a few liberal politicians, the ones who fought at the same time for a free constitution that would guarantee freedom of religion. Now, is it really a relevant argument that somebody, and especially one who is considered a genius and far ahead of his contemporaries, was neither better nor worse than his times? Would you excuse somebody living in Germany in the 1930’s or 1940’s the same way? [The regnant view that he was not worse than his times is Bruce H. Kirmmse, &#8220;Kierkegaard, Jews, and Judaism,&#8221; in<em> Kierkegaardiana</em> vol. 17 1994]</p>
<p>Piety: What do you think was the biggest problem that critics of the book had with it?</p>
<p>Tudvad: <strong>That I made clear a tight link between Kierkegaard’s theology and his anti-Semitism. People seemed to be surprised that anti-Semitism as such has it’s origin in Christianity.</strong> The Nazis did not invent anti-Semitism, did they?</p></blockquote>
<p>Tudvad&#8217;s new data will likely be debated in the Jewish community in the upcoming years. Kierkegaard will now receive the same treatment as Heidegger, Ezra Pound, or Paul DeMan, especially when the antisemitic passages that were censored out are all returned. Closer to the mark he will receive the same treatment as the other Germanic Lutherans whose theology had Marcion antisemitic overtones such as Adolf von Harnack and J. F.W. Schlegel  On the other hand, my Centrist Orthodox elevator companion will probably not be interested in the entire debate.</p>
