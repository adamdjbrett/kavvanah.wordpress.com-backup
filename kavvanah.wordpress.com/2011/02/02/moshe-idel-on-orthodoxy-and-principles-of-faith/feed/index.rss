					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Radbaz makes two strong claims. First, the Torah is a perfect whole, and its perfection is tainted by the attempt to focus on some of its teachings while marginalizing others. Second, there is no way for us to discern any hierarchy in the divine commandments, because we can grasp neither the “external” justification for their practice, nor their “internal” mystical essence. Therefore, according to him, we must perform all of the commandments with equal devotion and refrain from taking liberties in assigning different degrees of importance to them. This approach of the Radbaz remains normative in Orthodoxy.

Is he joking? That may be theoretically true, but in practice Orthodoxy shelves parts of the Torah. Please show me the Jews who are so makpid in halacha that they learn to distinguish between het and khaf and so forth. They may enunciate every word in the shema clearly and separately, as halacha demands, but almost no one makes any attempt to learn milael/ milera and other rules that are really crucial and normative so that they can daven properly. I know that there are those upon whom to rely (at least for het/ khaf) but please find me another area of halacha where a kula is accepted as normative?]]></description>

I was also thinking that Abarabnel could be used as an alternate model. Idel&#039;s emphasis is on praxis and every part is important. here are many similar Ashkenaz statements. I could possible also use Rabbenu Yonah.
Idel is not addressing Kellner. For Idel, ikarim means the entire Jewish philosophic and mystical quest in the Twersky sense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is Idel trying to argue against Kellner, who sees Maimonides&#039; Ikkurim as a major change in Jewish thought that went unnoticed until the fifteenth century? 

If we follow Idel, then I guess Isaac Abarbanel is the founder of Orthodoxy since the claim that all things in the Torah are equal in needing to be believed was his main contribution to the debate over Ikkurim.]]></description>
