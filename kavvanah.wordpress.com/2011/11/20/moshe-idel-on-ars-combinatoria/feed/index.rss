					<description><![CDATA[Adam,
I am just getting a chance to catch up on emails. Yes, Rav Dryfus has been exposed to post-modernism, but not formally to Derrida or any other formal philosopher. The world of Siah, Othniel, et al have a sense that the grand project of scientific formulation, and abstraction is over. The Israeli Daatim Hadashim include certain aspects of psychoanalysis, Existentialism, and expressionistic aesthetics into their end of a rand narrative theology. And Rav Nahman and Rav Zadok become post-modern in the sense of post-Brisk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don’t know enough to give a correct summary of exactly how the Leibnitz ideas on combinations have been carried forward into our time, but certain lines of development seem at least to me vaguely connected.: a) The development of mathematical logic in  Boole , Frege etc and the developments after Gödel’s theorem, model theory, recursive function theory and general algebras. They  all have some vague connection to Leibnitz, but were developed independently. b) The work of Chomsky and even more so Jerry Fodor on how the mind learns grammars, producers grammatical sentences and represents ideas/objects/impressions  that yield thoughts, sentences and propositions. c) Various ideas on promoting the unity of science, how biology is based on chemistry which in turn is based on physics. And how physics is reducible to combinations of basic forces/elements.  d) Abstract models of computation, Turing tests. e) Artificial Intelligence. 

But  to go from 1)there are no direct non- theory laden observations  to 2) the way scientific theories are accepted and rejected is a more complex story than positivists allow(Kuhn, Feyerabend),  to 3)we have no knowledge of the external world (Rorty) to 4)it’s all a matter of the play language (Derrida) to 5) ERGO Renaissance magic,  is  a mouthful, and kind of silly. So undoubtedly all this will catch on and Idel will win the Templeton Prize.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan,
Thank you for the interesting comments and links.  I was also thinking over the weekend about the degree of influence of Derrida and others on those who study Jewish mysticism.  In my case, however, the reading that inspired my pondering was not academic, but rather a book my son gave to me for my birthday called Hatuna shel Avudim.  Rabbi Yair Dreyfus is the author.  He is the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Siah, which he founded with Rav Shagar z&quot;l.  The institution is a bastion of Religious Zionist Neo-Hasidic study and worship.  The Dreyfus book is based on classes that he taught over the course of a year on the last of Reb Nahman&#039;s stories, Ma&#039;ase be-Shiv&#039;at ha-Kabzanim.  In the introductory chapter he addresses Reb Nahman&#039;s transition from teaching ideas to telling stories.  Rabbi Dreyfus&#039; discussion focuses on how sentences constructed to formulate ideas place limitations on meaning whereas stories offer greater opportunities for the listener or reader to experience and to draw multiple meanings and associations with individual words, phrases, characters etc..  This is pretty clear to those familiar with post-modernist literary discourse.  I do not have a thorough knowledge of  Reb Nahman&#039;s oeuvre but I could not help wondering whether Rabbi Dreyfus came to his understanding through his independent reading of the tale or through exposure to Derrida and others.
Best,
Adam]]></description>
