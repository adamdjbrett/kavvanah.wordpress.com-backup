					<description><![CDATA[Len beat me to it on the identities of these Buddhist leaders.

I often wonder about the generational change in American Jews.  Personally, I&#039;m out of touch with the younger generations; but I have the impression that they are driven primarily by different questions.  When I become observant (in the early and mid 70s), the driving interests were essentially like those of our hip older siblings - we spoke (at least) about things like truth and enlightenment.  Even in activist circles like protestors for Israel or Soviet Jewry, one heard discussion of philosophical and spiritual issues at the Shabbat table.  I have no actual data, but it seems that what I hear much more now is more &#039;earthly&#039; - concerns over political and social justice, the environment, etc. in their own right; not driven by some higher spiritual perspective or truth.  I certainly think that the observance of the commandments that I see across America is more driven by &#039;prax&#039; considerations than &#039;dox&#039; ones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ve noticed that Kornfeld, Fischer and Levine were all born Jewish.

Did you publish this to suggest there&#039;s a parallel there to  generational differences in American Judaism?]]></description>
