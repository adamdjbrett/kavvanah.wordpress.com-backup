					<description><![CDATA[I remember reading an issue of Salmagundi, the Swarthmore magazine, devoted to the topic of boredom , probably in the early 80’s.  The idea I remember is that boredom is aggression turned inwards or anger/aggression that is repressed. Once you lay down this idea, the literature on depression becomes available and you can darshan away. The image in my mind is that other authors connected boredom with Christopher Lasch and his book “The Culture of Narcissism(1979).” Lasch had a pretty good run , more than 10 minutes of fame and then he disappeared.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As we are on the cusp of 2012 I&#039;m wondering if the concept of boredom is back to the old definition of impatience. With the world of technology, smart phones, twitter &quot;that concept is so 45 seconds ago&quot; and halfshabbos, is boredom especially in shul without our &quot;tech support&quot; impatience with overly long services? If I bring a book on Jewish concepts to read during the sermon in shul will that keep me from getting bored... or is it impatient?]]></description>
