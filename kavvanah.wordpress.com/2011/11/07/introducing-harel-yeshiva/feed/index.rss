					<description><![CDATA[So are they competing for the same audience as other post-college programs (including the BT yeshivas) or do they have a more specific one in mind?

I am curious as to how Gender studies (one of the great books categories) gets taught in the context of an all male yeshiva with an all male faculty. Is the vision of the post-collegiate spiritual seeker that of the man seeking refuge or engagement? If it is the latter as they claim, how is an all male yeshiva not a radical form of disengagement. Tamar Ross is on the advisory board so maybe I&#039;ll ask her at some point.]]></description>
