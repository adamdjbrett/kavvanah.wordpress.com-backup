More than, that I would lack the ability to put it all together ...how do you integrate Deluze with Cavell with Agamben with....A derech in reading is to proceed slowly from what one understands and gradually try to widen the circle of authors. Just racing through these books is dangerous. You end up knowing a little about a lot of high falutin books. The correct goal is to deepen one&#039;s understanding, proceed slowly and to feel so comfortable with a way of thinking that it can be said over in one&#039;s own way and adapted to other conversations..]]></description>
