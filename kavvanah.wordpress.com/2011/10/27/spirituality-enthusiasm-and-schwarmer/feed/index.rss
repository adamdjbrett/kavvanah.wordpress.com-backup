It would not be the Zohar or esoteric study. There are some forms of ruah, enthusiasm, seeking experience, fantasy, kumzitz, ebbings, emotional manipulation, rallys, or merging into the dancing that many thinkers consider as crossing a line. The point is that there is a line to these thinkers. Where the line actually is located is subject to debate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m not too clear when someone is a schwarmer. The Zohar’s worlds and sefirot are a priori without any tie in to experience, and have virtually no predictive power. When do we become schwarmers, in imagining such worlds, in thinking  these terms point/refer to real transcendental entities, or must we also believe that we know they are real?  Suppose someone accepts some story about heaven for the sake of finding a place for punishment and reward, which in turn is felt necessary for morality, but he doesn’t make any knowledge claims…he hopes, he imagines, he wishes and so on. What exactly is the sin?  Why isn’t my imagination, my dreams and the like autonomous? Believing in God is ok, imagining a God who hangs out with angels whose names are….is schwarmerei. Why?]]></description>
