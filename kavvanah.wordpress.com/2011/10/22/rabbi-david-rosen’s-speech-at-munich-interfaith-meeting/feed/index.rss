					<description><![CDATA[ Back in 2009 they reversed the original wording of their 2002 document &quot;Covenant and Mission&quot;  (http://old.usccb.org/doctrine/covenant09.pdf, excerpted here: http://www.angelqueen.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26520&#038;sid=807d171e48cf894d92486a4e4fce9d82), which provoked a heated response from Jewish leaders (http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/usccb_letter.asp).  The original document approached dual covenant theory a bit too closely for the Church&#039;s comfort, watered down the need to evangelize and witness the Gospel to Jews, and wasn&#039;t clear about how the Church definitely welcomes those Jews who are moved to seek  conversion.

The USCCB web page on the Catechism (http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catechism/catechism-of-the-catholic-church/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-catechism-of-the-catholic-church.cfm - see #18 and 19) is clear that the results of the Second Vatican Council have not been fully integrated into the Catechism.

Regarding whether God&#039;s covenants with the Jews achieve salvation for them, CCC 846 still says: 


846 &quot;&quot;Outside the Church there is no salvation&quot; - How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the Church Fathers?  Re-formulated positively, it means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body:

Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.


The last line of CCC 846 is pretty clear: if you refuse to enter or remain in the Church, you can not be saved.

So if the Church believes that the Jewish covenants are effective for Jews (perhaps by including Jews within the Church), its own Catechism doesn&#039;t yet reflect that belief.  Hopefully, they will take steps to change it.]]></description>

Len- 
What are you talking about? I wish you would look up the sources.
Here is the current USCCB teaching version for Adults 2009- &quot;To the Jewish people, whom God first chose to hear his word, &#039;belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ&#039;&quot; (Rom 9: 4-5; cf. CCC, No. 839). 
Here is the 2008 version that is still used in some locations and other documents. The original sentence read: &quot;Thus the covenant that God made with the Jewish people through Moses remains eternally valid for them.&quot;
If you have a different catechism or one from the 1950&#039;s then dont use it. Try and quote specific texts and specific interpreters.]]></description>

Len,

To deal with your first comment. The hierarchy rejects a dual covenant because accept a single covenant through Abraham. Jews are now treated as Protestants. Your discussion of dammed and saved is quite confused.  They can say that Jews were God&#039;s first chosen and through Abraham we share grace, revelation, and covenant but not a complete belief. Your intervention discussion is Evangelical language. For the accepted hierarchy position- chew on the words of Cardinal Kasper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cardinal Kasper: &quot;it is not necessary to become a Catholic in order to be saved by God&quot;, and assures them that &quot;Judaism, i.e. the faithful response of the Jewish people to God&#039;s irrevocable covenant, is salvific for them, because God is faithful to his promises&quot; -- without providing any degree of theological clarification of these points, he assists in fostering an attitude of ambivalence towards the necessity of Jesus Christ and his Church for salvation.

Two years later, Cardinal Walter Kasper, president of the Pontifical Commission for Relations With the Jews, told a U.S. conference that Christians cannot ignore their core belief in the universality of salvation in Christ. However, he said, &quot;this does not mean that Jews, in order to be saved, have to become Christians; if they follow their own conscience and believe in God&#039;s promises as they understand them in their religious tradition, they are in line with God&#039;s plan, which for us comes to historical completion in Jesus Christ.&quot;

The main difference between the two faiths -- the salvific role of Jesus Christ -- must also be acknowledged, he said. &quot;The universality of Christ&#039;s redemption for Jews and gentiles is so fundamental throughout the entire New Testament ... that it cannot be ignored or passed over in silence,&quot; Cardinal Kasper said. 

&quot;This does not mean that Jews in order to be saved have to become Christians; if they follow their own conscience and believe in God&#039;s promises as they understand them in their religious tradition, they are in line with God&#039;s plan, which for us comes to historical completion in Jesus Christ,&quot; he said. 

Cardinal Kasper pointed out that Christians and Jews share the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament; the common figures of Abraham, Moses, patriarchs and prophets; the covenant and promises of a unique God; and a messianic hope. 
Cardinal Kasper said the question of mission will ultimately be resolved in the context of a Christian theology of Judaism. The church is only at the beginning of this process, which began with the Second Vatican Council, he said. 
&quot;The long period of anti-Judaistic theology cannot be overcome in only 40 years,&quot; he said. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the second point- replacement theology meant that Jews are no longer the chosen people. Now, Cardinal Koch, who is Kasper&#039;s replacement has even said that &quot;Jews are still he chosen people.&quot; What that means we will see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been following this topic pretty closely, and I can&#039;t understand what Rabbi Rosen sees that I don&#039;t.

First: As I understand it, the Catholic Church firmly rejects any hint of a dual covenant theory.  So Jews are not saved and have no possibility of being saved (read that as: are damned) unless they either accept Jesus, or - and admittedly this is a big improvement - God (which for them means Jesus) intervenes with an act of Grace.

Second: When Rabbi Rosen uses the words &quot;replacement theology&quot;, doesn&#039;t he understand that the Catholic Church clearly asserts that the Church is &quot;Israel&quot;?  As I understand their stance, they don&#039;t need to assert that the Church  replaced the Jews as &quot;Israel&quot; (per  the simple definition of &quot;replacement theology&quot;) because they believe that the identity of &quot;Israel&quot; pre-dates the Jews, and that the Jews simply ceased being &quot;Israel&quot; when they no longer met the criteria for &quot;Israel&quot;.  Whoever meets the criteria (i.e., the Church) is &quot;Israel&quot;.  No post-Jesus replacement is necessary.

I&#039;d appreciate correction if I have this wrong.

If I&#039;m correct, I don&#039;t understand what a &quot;theology of partnership&quot; could be based on.  Isn&#039;t Rabbi Rosen reading far more into the Church&#039;s position than really exists?]]></description>
