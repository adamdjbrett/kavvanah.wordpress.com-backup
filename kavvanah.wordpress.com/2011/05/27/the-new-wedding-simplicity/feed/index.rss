At my wedding, my parents made a point of paying union scale to the band, which was, in the event, Dad&#039;s hk&quot;m first cousin Sid Beckerman a&quot;h and a couple of session guys (possibly yblcht&quot;a Pete Sokolow and someone else).  But then, Dad and his family were mostly musicians.

(P.S. it was at the memorial service for Sid that we found out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://thanbook.blogspot.com/2007/09/long-yisroels-journey-into-levite.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;we were leviim&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Jordan here. Not only with regard to paying wedding bands and other vendors a living wage but but good ethics in all businesses should be included. I like the idea of an Uri L&#039;Tzedek hechsher for businesses. Is the attorney you are about to hire charging a living wage for himself and his staff or is he padding the client&#039;s billable hours because his business is down? Is he charging you $2.00 for every copy from a black and white copy machine when in fact it cost him about 25 - 50 cents? Is the real estate broker in town making seniors sign a blank listing contract while saying, &quot;trust me darling!&quot; or actually suggesting and elderly or ill person have another family member present to explain what everything says? I would welcome my business being examined for an Uri L&#039;Tzedek approval!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a supporter of Uri L&#039;Tzedek. At this point I don’t see how they could possibly get their message across without some moralizing. 

The wedding business has obscene profit margins…maybe not all vendors, but many. Of course there are endless ways of getting it done, but the fact that most everyone has to economize is an indication of the problem. Donald Trump has this witty line that goes “Ivanka had unlimited funds and she still went over budget.”]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[True enough. But my point is really that across the Jewish world, there are a number of different businesses in a number of different fields, and those who claim to speak for a more righteous position in how business is conducted need to realize that there are a variety of ways in which an ethical position is pursued that extend far beyond the production of food. By all m,eans, the OU shouldn&#039;t certify non kashrus items, but an organization such as Uri L&#039;Tzedek needs to understand that Jewish Business  ethics play out in a number of spheres, and living up to our highest ideals may cost money as well.]]></description>

Tav HaYosher on wedding bands? Remember that the expansion of hashgachos on previously uncertified products such as water and drain cleaner came at the request of the producers who sought a competitive advantage. The OU would never have thought of it on its own.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are a number of ways in which one can call into question how the choices were made. First of all, the bride and groom themselves acknowledge the choice between paper and real dishes, and the consequences of each choice. They chose to save money. In other words, a Rabbi who founded an organization which puts a responsibility to do business at a higher cost on the business, by fulfilling ethical and halachic concerns regarding the treatment of workers, a stance with which I agree, was willing to make am actively bad choice for the rest of society in order to save a little gelt. In other words, yenems money is his to monitor, but his own money is not so easy to part with. 
Another question. As a musician, I actively engage in making sure that when I present a product to a client, I try to hit the sweet spot between too much and not enough. I charge a price that takes into account the fact that we try to pay a living wage to our workers, plus honor a union contract that provides health care and pension payments for our workers. Did this young couple consider the consequences of doing a job on the cheap? Why is it that wedding workers don&#039;t have to be part of an ethically run business? Did the vendors they dealt with offer discounts for cash? 
I am sure everyone is congratulating themselves on outwitting those nasty wedding vendors. I am not. I will be more impressed when the Tav HaYosher seal can be found on bands and caterers who play fair. I know I do.]]></description>

No its just about signalling. There is no unintended anything. Its an intentional signal! Duh. The deflationary point is that, with increased signalling opportunities from the internet that are less correlated with spending money there will be a permanent decline in expensive signalling. For instance, in the example Tyler Cowen gives, if you read Tyler&#039;s blog about ethnic restaurants and seek out the best $3 Sichuan food in N. Virginia,  you can signal high status consumer behavior of seeking out exotic foods without breaking the bank on dinner at Masa. Similarly the hatan and kallah here signal their various high status ethical concerns which are not shared by their poor friends who they graciously protect. All while saving a few bucks on the chicken with mushroom sauce and potato chip thing we have all seen a million times anyway. Its a real win win for everyone who is not a caterer. Although one could say that lowering the threshold to status displays could lead to greater overall expenditure on status displays, contra Cowen.]]></description>
