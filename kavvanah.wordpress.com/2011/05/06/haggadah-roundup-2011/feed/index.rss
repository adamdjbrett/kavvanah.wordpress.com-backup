It&#039;s totally different.  It&#039;s not so much a commentary as a collection of Chidushei Torah on different sugyas in Pesachim.   It is not the type of Hagaddah you would use at the seder for saying Divrei Torah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this Haggadah roundup format. I used machon schechter and as always, biala rebbe.
Re: RY Eyebeschutz, I just saw this morning in the compilation Yaari im Divashi that he says the majority of people in his community drink yayin nesach since they assume that they will not end up having forbidden relations from it. But it is guaranteed that they will! Besides which even Jewish wine is not necessarily Kosher because so many people are in the category of muumar. 
Additionally, Pawel Maciejko has a nice long section on Rabbeinu Wolf Eyebeschutz which compares him to Casanova and Jacob Frank.]]></description>
