					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m all for Jews and Cristians getting along.. what i object to is eschatology, whether Jewish or Cristian.  In his book Common Prayers, Harvey Cox recounts that as a child in sunday school he was taught that the difference..., sometimes it was put as the only differnce, between the Christians and the Jews was that &quot;they believe that the messiah is yet to come&quot;.  So when he got to Harvard as a freshman and met his first Jew he said &quot;oh yeah, &quot;you believe the messiah is yet to come. Right?&quot; The Jewish student replied.. &quot;to tell you the truth, I don&#039;t think he&#039;s ever coming.&quot; Cox was taken aback, as a Christian, since if the messiah has not yet come, and he is not yet to come, where does that leave us [Christians]&quot;? (pp 125-126) 
This raises an interesting question....  there are many good Jews who are not waiting for the messiah and actually think that messianism and escatology is one of the lousiest ideas to come out of pre-exilic judaism... What would a Christian look like who doesn&#039;t believe in messianism or escatology?  For me, the question to Rabbi Riskin, is where does he stand on Jews who do not believe that we are in ... what he calls: &quot;pre-eschaton days&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@AvrahamBronstein: I don&#039;t think Rabbi Riskin has become more universal.
