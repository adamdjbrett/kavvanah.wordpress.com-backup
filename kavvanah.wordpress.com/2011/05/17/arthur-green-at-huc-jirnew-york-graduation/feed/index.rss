					<description><![CDATA[I was present at the speech as I received a DD, honoris causa at the ceremony. Green&#039;s speech was well-received by the rabbis and other Jewish professionals present. My family thought it was too long! But it was really addressed to rabbis.

I found it interesting that David Ellenson mentioned that this was the first honorary degree Art Green has ever received. I actually find that astonishing. I also found it politically interesting that HUC choose to honor him in this way given the challenge of non-denominational seminaries like Hebrew College to HUC and JTS. It&#039;s common for HUC and JTS to honor each other&#039;s faculty but this is a horse of a different color.

It was also interesting to me that Ellenson called Shelly Zimmerman up to present the master&#039;s degree to the student cantor at the shul which Zimmerman serves. I guess he is now rehabilitated.]]></description>
