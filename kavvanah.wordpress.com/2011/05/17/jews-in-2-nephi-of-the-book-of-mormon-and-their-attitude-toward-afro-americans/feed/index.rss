					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/jews-in-2-nephi-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-their-attitude-toward-afro-americans/#comment-3058&quot;&gt;leto&lt;/a&gt;.

The fact that American Indian DNA does not resemble Jewish DNA could have a simple explanation consistent with the Book of Mormon being of God ... When God put a darker skin on them and made them undesireable to look at, their DNA was changed at that time.

Although this apparently worked for the Nephites, I will say I have found myself attracted to several Indian women.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found the comments referred to in 2 Nephi 29.3-14. to be extremely rude and inpolite. It sounds like it is saying something like calling a person who believes in the Bible is a fool.And I know what the God says in the Bible and what it says about fools and people who despise his holy word which is the Bible. As far as I am concerned, anyone who does not believe in the Bible is cursed. The Bible stands for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i had very nice experiences with the Mormons in new York.  Wholesome moral people would be the word.  The problem I have with Mormonism  is theological.  Joseph Smith predicted a new temple in that generation. That was positive prophecy that was not fulfilled. Also DNA does not lie. DNA shows the American Indians are not directly related to Jews but are rather closer to the Mongolians races of east Asia.  However any system of beliefs tends to have problems with it including orthodox Judaism. I think what really matters is if a person is a mencht and in that area Mormons excel.]]></description>
