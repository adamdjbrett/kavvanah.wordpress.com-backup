					<description><![CDATA[It is hard to imagine Jews of my generation redeveloping a true social conscious.  Some of us have not volunteered selflessly for anything significant since college. The once altruistic,  lately selfish, rich and self indulged boomer Jew wants it all.  A generation after making money sitting on their backsides in offices or examination rooms , stating the obvious, collecting fees and searching for their next juicy opportunity a certain guilt has set in for some.  A charitable event or position here or there when time allows doesn&#039;t seem to balance out a lifetime of self interested moneymaking. So now the natural thought is to use all this extra money and talent to save society and particularly Jewish society.  Boomer moral high ground was lost a long time ago and its  conceit to think that the younger generations should listen to us.  If you want to do charity.... then risk your body and soul, duck bullets , risk malaria or dengue fever or teach the poor.  Find the poor and downtrodden Jew or gentile and help; you&#039;ll gain the younger generation&#039;s respect with no less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that one should distinguish between the Modern Orthodox and the Yeshivish in this area.

The Yeshivish do have a program for aging baby boomers, having them learn in Yeshivos, in Kollelim, etc. and using their skills in Yeshivish social services organizations. 

I am not saying that it&#039;s any better than the Modern Orthodox. But for BT&#039;s who (or their kids) went Yeshivish, it&#039;s an option that seeks to give them opportunity to experience Judaism, even if it does not validate their opinions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;We are creating programs for synagogue, JCC’s and stand alone groups.&lt;/em&gt;

Are you a competitor to the Elcott &#038; Himmelfarb initiative?
Nu, so what are you creating? be specific with details?
Are you just a consulting firm to give the management strategy needed for the transition period for a half dozen years?
How much do you think the Baby-Boomers will seek to go backwards and return to their childhood or their dreams of the 1960&#039;s?
P.S Your link to your URL does not work.]]></description>
