					<description><![CDATA[Ouch! Russian Haskalah cut off from actual academic trends in Germany! I&#039;ll try to get over that one. But from whence the inference that I am unaware of the academic Bible scholars in our midst? As for the title, all my TeaneckShuls posts have humorous titles; no reason this one shouldn&#039;t. I was toying with &quot;Knohl, Kaufmann, Kugel and Gunkel&quot; but decided to go for something that was a) more basic and b) didn&#039;t sound like a law firm, since business posts are generally prohibited on TeaneckShuls and that might have held up the posting.]]></description>
