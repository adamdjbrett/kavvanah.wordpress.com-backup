					<description><![CDATA[Why should a Jew feel more comfortable wishing someone a Ramadan Mubarak than Merry Xmas?  Aside from the lesser theological problem with Islam, I&#039;d say (going on my wife&#039;s experience) that it&#039;s more social. Jews &#038; Muslims are both minorities, with endogamy, a strong legal tradition, similar modesty restrictions, and holidays that wander around on the calendar and are thus not well known to the general society.  So there&#039;s already some sympathy for the other minority in the Christian land.

And there&#039;s the rub - wishing someone Merry Christmas means giving in to the majority culture&#039;s cultural imperialism - their automatic assumption that everyone follows their rhythms, is part of their system, celebrates Xmas, and you&#039;re a weirdo if you tell them otherwise.  The whole structure of society in November/December is meant to force people into the Xmas mold.  We Jews are contrarians, am keshei oref, and resist being absorbed into the Christian culture.

Whereas,  wishing a Muslim a Ramadan Kareem (what does the adjective mean, BTW?) is one minority wishing another minority strength in keeping to their culture.  It probably helps that we&#039;re both on a lunar calendar.  It&#039;s self-affirming, in encouraging another minority to stay strong, rather than self-effacing, in giving up one&#039;s identity to the majoritarian Christmas juggernaut.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this post! (I&#039;m one of those regular Muslim readers.) The natural companion piece would read along the lines of &#039;Why should a Muslim care about the Days of Awe&#039;.
