					<description><![CDATA[Oy!    Regrettably, your interesting question(s) would take more time to properly respond to than I have available at the moment.  But what prompted my remark was that the radicalism of many aggadic passages, reflectiing or demonstrating the radicalism of Chazal themselves, is ignored/suppressed in today&#039;s religious world.  Anything that does not conform to a very narrow perspective on lore and law ... just is &#039;airbrushed&#039; out of the picture.  On the matter of Sinai - the mystery of Sinai is abandoned in favour of a very concrete narrative.  Many years ago, the Agudah weekly in London ran an article by a respected maggid shiur in a Hasidic yeshivah who bemoaned the fact that a characteristic of our age was that aggadot were treated as literal truth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I would add that aggadic dimensions of Sinai are probably considered dangerous if not heretical by today’s Orthodox world,&lt;/em&gt;

Paul,
Are there any specific aggadic dimensions that you can identify as most problematic? How do you explain today&#039;s Orthodox world rejecting explicit Midrash and Aggadah about Sinai? They obviously dont think Hazal were heretics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting ... this (last) Shavuot I gave a Tikkun Leil in Palm Beach shul based entirely on texts from Agnon&#039;s anthology.  I agree it is a massively under-appreciated and little-known work, both in Hebrew and English.  Why?  I think the answers are as suggested (Shavuot is not a high-profile holiday, RH/YK worshippers are looking for something to read etc).  But I would add that aggadic dimensions of Sinai are probably considered dangerous if not heretical by today&#039;s Orthodox world, which is also closed to scholars and scholarship of the genre represented by Agnon.   Interestingly, one or two Israelis/former Israelis present at the shiur expressed astonishment that Agnon was &quot;also&quot; a talmid chacham and personally observant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The High Holidays provide a captive market for Jewish publishers: Many Jews consider themselves chained to the pews, and are looking for something acceptably holy to read.

					<description><![CDATA[Your question could be answered in terms of marketing.  If American Jews mostly ignore Shavuot, a Shavuot book isn&#039;t likely to sell well in America.  And if the subset of people more likely to celebrate Shavuot are also less likely to be favorably disposed towards this particular author, sales will be doubly impaired.   

It is telling that the non-profit JPS published it.  A for-profit publisher probably would have passed.]]></description>
