					<description><![CDATA[When I was a freshman in college (1984), Jerry Falwell gave a speech at Princeton.  During the question-and-answer part, someone asked if he agreed with the then-recent statement from Bailey Smith, the head of the Southern Baptist Convention, that &quot;God does not hear the prayers of the Jews?&quot;  After some hemming and hawing, Mr. Falwell answered affirmatively.

Is theology disjoint from interfaith relations?  I find it hard to reconcile this positive attitude towards Zionism, necessarily rooted in the chosen-ness of the Jews and the eternal covenants between God and Abraham, between God and Bnei Yisrael in the Desert, and the attitude he expressed above, which implies a detachment of God from the Jews in the post-Crucifixion world.  One is dispensationalism, the other is its opposite, supersessionism, no?]]></description>
