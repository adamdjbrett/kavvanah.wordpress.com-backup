					<description><![CDATA[This strikes me a poignant piece that brings out to the knee jerk sociologists of the other day the elegiac tone that some of us got from your analysis of Modern Orthodoxy. In the end the class was about what was not and could have been and you sketched this history of missed connections and opportunities that almost ended up as a melancholy meditation on the modernity we never had, almost had, had and lost. Looking at R Tzair&#039;s words and his interlocutors, it is hard to imagine that this is anything but a sort of dead letter which was never picked up. In that case the modern orthodoxy project can be recast as a profoundly ethical one-- to recapture the lost idiosyncratic voices who wanted an American Sanhedrin to supplant cantorial music.]]></description>
