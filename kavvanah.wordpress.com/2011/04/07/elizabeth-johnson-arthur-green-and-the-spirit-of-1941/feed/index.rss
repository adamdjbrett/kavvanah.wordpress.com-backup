Thank for the insight. There are several sites that connect the Bishops office to radical Orthodoxy. I should have given one. I forgot that you have read them. My problem here and this gets to be insider baseball, is that the Bishops who pushed for this are not necessarily Thomist. And some of the younger hands in the drafting studied with Johnson and accept Rahner. 
A moderate perspective starts with David Tracy. I think she was trying to stay within Tracy&#039;s guidelines of a capacious, subjective, and multi-valent form of analogy. For those who want some background to my discussion with EJ- see&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1626&#038;C=1576&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1626&#038;C=1575&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here,&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/tracy.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;
I think that my be my problem with this Jewish debate. The lack of form. &quot;let&#039;s get real&quot; and &quot;let&#039;s get traditional&quot; are politics not good theology. Maybe I should send Landes the Radical Orthodoxy reader?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Catholic tradition insists that all attributes that are predicated of God even if originally acquired by human experience can be understood only analogously. Thus  predicates mean something different when applied to natural kinds than when used in connection with God. Common sense says the meanings are univocal… exists, powerful,loving, suffering  and all the rest mean the same both with respect to God and created beings, it’s just that God is different from objects.(See Quine’s Word and Object.) The first view is the Thomistic view, the second was held by Duns Scotus. (see pg 7-8 of the  Bishop’s statement.) Even though these human concepts do not have the same meaning when applied to God, Catholicism claims they do give “real if limited knowledge of God.” On the univocal view they give us knowledge, provided of course the sentce is true and the assertion is justified, because the predicate has the same meaning here on earth as  in the transcedental realm. The Catholic formula is  we can have knowledge of God, but He is incomprehensible. (Somehow they equate this view with negative theology, where all we can know is what God is not. (pg.9…apophaticism of the Church Fathers.)) Sr. Johnson because she denies the knowledge that can be acquired by the analogical use of terms, ends up saying  all predicates of God are metaphors,  do not express any literal truth about God, and are therefore to be evaluated by pragmatic considerations and to prevent these terms being used to maintain unfair distributions of power. (Big heresy!!!.)

The paper reinforced this point on pg.14 when it says the entire feminist program of Sr. Johnson for replacing patriarchal language is based on her ‘radical’ position that all theological language and concepts are mere metaphors, and do not describe even in a limited way  the reality that is God. They then point out how this error leads Sr. Johnson to think God is present and active in other religions, whereas the Catholic position is that other religions can receive their fulfilment only in Catholicism.(pg. 15-16) 

Now here is my point…on the surface there are parallels here to Green-Landes. But Landes does not locate the failure of Green in his failure to use terms analogically. Politically Green lines up with Sr. Johnson, but his arguments are more of the form…let’s get real, no reasonable version of Judaism can possibly hold X, so clearly we need to hold Y. And he is right as far as the cultural- political  beliefs of his audience. The guys who are making arguments similar to the Bishops are the Anglican theologans of Radical Orthodoxy, John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock. This is so cute or should I say cool …Western civilation has fallen apart and  become this horrible, sinful place because we went with Duns Scotus and forgot Thomism. Scotus’ rejection of analogy which led to, wooo,  nominalism is seen as a precursor to modernity. Who knew?  

After I thought of this little chidush  I found this post…baruch shekivanti…Smile

					<description><![CDATA[i can understand to some degree why some people would be troubled with tampering with doctrine.  i had in a small way a kind of experience with this. It happened when i wrote a small essay 
 knocking the pantheism of modern day chasidut. It was not that i am against pantheism per see but i did not like the idea that it is presented in chasidic  books as being the regular doctrine of Torah. Fine i say if you believe in it --but don&#039;t go around trying to sell it as traditional Judaism. For a while it seemed this essay was stirring up trouble for me until one (litvack) rosh yeshiva said not to leave it in his yeshiva. He did not mind other writing that i left there; but that one people were taking as an attack on rebbi nachman directly. I did not intend it that way. Rather I was trying to defend rebbi nachman and explained that he did not endorse pantheism at all and it was just present day   breslov rebbis and were using the name of rebbi nachman to endorse pantheism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Len,
You had your chance to show me with argumentation your opinion and not just tell me and you didn&#039;t. You could have cited passages and we could have had a discussion about ideas rather than arguing about people. You had a dozen posts to discuss the issue. At least with Alan Lew, you argued with citations about why he was not just a Buddhist theologian who keeps mizvot. Look how you argued in the Lew case. Here you did not. Now, the time is over. Let this topic pass. The new topic is about Beth Johnson and any parallel&#039;s with Green. Now go read the USSCB and Johnson.  We know your opinion on Landes. To restate it without new data does not add to the conversation. Please dont turn into a troll.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;&quot;It sounds a lot like Arthur Green and her critics sound a lot like Daniel Landes. One side is post mystical and post Holocaust and the other side does not read carefully but knows enough that this is not traditional and that they do not like it.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

You don&#039;t give Daniel Landes enough credit.  In my opinion he&#039;s read Green very closely and has made pointed criticisms that Green doesn&#039;t seem to understand, or at the least refuses to acknowledge.]]></description>
