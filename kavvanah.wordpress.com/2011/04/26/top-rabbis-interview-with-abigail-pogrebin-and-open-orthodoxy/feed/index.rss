No, the desideratum is an economic future history of Orthodox Judaism. Which is tougher to pull off.

However, to the extant that economic journalism / sociology of Orthodox Judaism can be practiced, I&#039;m open to suggestions and willing to making phone calls. With the very restrictive caveat that said phone calls and leg work be confined to Bergen and perhaps Rockland County.]]></description>

This seems to be an -- undedifying, five years on -- disagreement about the percentages within Orthodoxy rather than the percentage of Orthodoxy within American Jewry. 

Since Heilman postulates that the Charedi market share of Orthodoxy is 27 to 32 percent (p. 76), I am left wondering what SIW thought the number should be.  Irrespective, the absolute numbers are &quot;in the noise&quot; relative to the broader demographic of American Jewry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An important point: The haredi Judaism of my childhood (e.g. Telshe yeshiva) was sustained by the non-Orthodox majority. There are no doubt still 80 year olds giving to Lakewood. Unless the community kollels are wildly successful, the community is creating a very different economic reality for itself. It can either change radically or collapse. My money is on both shocking change and shocking attrition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So 600k Orthodox and 200k Haredim (143k , actually) estimated as of 2005.

Has there any quantitative analysis of the 2010 census data yet?

So what&#039; s your best guess for 2030? Doubling of Orthodox to 1.2m and tripling of Haredi to 600k? I&#039;ll take the under, myself. We haven&#039;t yet seen a modern Judaism that maintained itself for three generations, and I don&#039;t think contemporary haredism will be the exception.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chasidim are not evangelical. They work , raise many children  and keep them close to home. They do not take responsibility for global poverty and pollution, and they don’t make any  attempt to change American culture at large. They don’t intermarry. They have a very high growth rate. The chasidic model is not represented in the Daily Beast list. It should, because over say 20 years the charedim  will become even more important.  That’s my point.

As for numbers, I implicitly relied on the estimates of Heilman in “Sliding Towards Orthodoxy.” I assume, relying on my sketchy memory that Orthodox are 10% going to 15% of the Jewish population, and that charedim and their fellow travelers are 60% of that number and chasidim are 60% of charedim, or around 200, 000 plus chasidim. I am not one of those who say Conservatives and Reform will disappear, though I do believe the current charedi retention rate is very high, and they will become an ever increasing percentage of the whole. The upshot is if the current Orthodox numbers are lower than I assumed, I stand corrected, but I don’t see why it effects my comment. 

There is something of a Larry Summers story going on here. It is said that every time Summers fails at a job he gets appointed to an even more important job. Here are a bunch of rabbis that failed to do their job, at least as a group. There wouldn’t be a Reform Vision Initiative if the Reform were a church militant on the march. The Conservatives would not be reinventing themselves every Monday and Thursday if they weren’t demoralized and confused. So Newsweek proceeds to honor these same rabbis for saying we have a problem. 

American Jews are not bereft of all vision. We have great novelists, important academics, vocal and influential journalists. Our problem is that in general our rabbis are weak, and getting weaker. The 2 Teitelbaums, the 2 Halberstams and the Twersky of New Square are going from strength to strength.]]></description>
