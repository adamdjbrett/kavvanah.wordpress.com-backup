Can it be, then, that the real reason more American Jews are now using it is that they have come to regard Judaism as someone else’s religion?</p></blockquote>
<p>As I was reading it, I knew that it was not true because I was in the middle of typing texts from the early 20th century in which both Reform and Orthodox Jews called themselves &#8220;denomination.&#8221; I also remembered that Marshall Sklare had used the term in the 1950&#8217;s. I was not going to respond <a href="../../../01/26/philo-palin-and-the-phrase-blood-libel/index.html">since I already responded </a>to one of his articles using Ngram to show he was wrong. Why do it again? But then I received an email from a friend who knows about language, and writes better than I do, exasperated about the column on denominations. After a few emails back and forth, sharing ideas and sharing places to check, the following guest post emerges from my email friend. I found the quote from Sklare, he found the use of the word streams. The humor is not mine but I post the entire thing. </p>
<blockquote><p>Guest post by Philobiblios<br />
Philologus is back to writing op-eds under the guise of philology. This week he claims that the use of the word “denomination” is new to Judaism. Its usage reflects a nefarious combination of Christian and apathy by liberal Jews impinging the authentic Jewish lexicon which, he says, prefers the term “movement.”</p>
<p>Philologus may have missed Marshall Sklare&#8217;s classic, <em>Conservative Judaism </em>(1955), which explains the rise and fall of different groups based on the Chicago School&#8217;s theory of first, second, and third places of immigrant settlement.  Sklare repeatedly uses the word denomination to discuss the shift from the denomination of Orthodoxy to that of Conservative. “Jews who rise in social class might simply leave one denomination, Orthodoxy, and switch their affiliation to Conservative or Reform. “ The term was used in all subsequent literature based on Sklare. Most Jewish sociologists continued to use the word (e.g. Chaim Waxman; Jack Wertheimer). Even amateur sociologists used it; see, for example, Hillel Halkin’s <em>Letters to an American Jewish Friend</em> (1977), where the three American denominations are discussed on page 118.</p>
<p>Ok, maybe Philologus had no interest in the Conservative movement of his youth. But he should have know that at the 1893 World’s Parliament of Religions the Jewish speakers presented as part of the Jewish Denominational Congress. American Jews were proud to take their stand as another faith and denomination.<br />
In fact, between 1893 and 1919, most references to the “movements“ are to the Reform denomination and the Orthodox denomination. (AB-I was actually working on these texts of the early twentieth century text when the op-ed appeared.)</p>
<p>Maybe Philologus does not like universalistic sociology and prefers his beloved tribal Zionism. Zionists surely would not use such a goyish word. But no. Jacob de Haas, the Hasidic and Haredi Zionist leader who worked with Brandeis to build American Zionism, used the word Jewish denominations throughout the 1940’s and 1950s. Maybe Philogos doesn&#8217;t like de Haas because he can&#8217;t fathom that a Zionist would be Hasidic and not a pork eater.</p>
<p>In any event, already in 1935 the term was being used to describe the constituents of the Synagogue Council of America.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s wrong with movements? No doubt the association with bowels makes the word less than ideal for copy editors (though it offers possibilities for low-minded headline writers.) </p>
<p>The current term, my journalist friends tell me, is “streams.” This is a translation of the Hebrew zerem, and has been the standard word out of Israeli dispatches since the 1970&#8217;s. Some of the earliest citations come from reports of Israeli leadership, in the late &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, promising American machers that if they came to power, they would work to recognize all “streams” of Judaism. How the term zerem came to apply to the religious movements, or denominations, is an interesting question. </p>
<p>But when it comes to English words, however, Philologus has to learn to use Google Books, the Ngram, and various other online archives before creating non-existent philology. </p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Last Thursday, the book <em>Quest for the Living God</em> by Sr. Elizabeth Johnson, was questioned by the US Bishops as “not accord with authentic Catholic teaching on essential points.” This is big news in the world of American theology. I repeat this is big news and generating lots of discussion. The report claimed that her view of the Trinity and God was incorrect. The response by some of the liberals was that it is a return to the middle ages and repression. A more thoughtful approach was that she was being attacked by the Bishops because of her feminism and they went after other aspects to be circumspect. Those who defend her find when they read through the Bishop’s documents that the Bishop’s office is not reading her book correctly. You know these less educated clergy misread and think she is nothing but jargon. There is a lot of buzz about why, why now, and who was responsible behind the scenes.</p>
<p>But when I read through the Bishop’s document, I find that they were condemning her for pantheism and panentheism, the use of mystical metaphors for God, and an immanent view of God that clashes with traditional doctrine. They also do not like her thinking that the Holocaust has changed theology. It sounds a lot like Arthur Green and her critics sound a lot like Daniel Landes. One side is post mystical and post Holocaust and the other side does not read carefully but knows enough that this is not traditional and that they do not like it. </p>
<p>The interesting thing is the same trend of thought by Johnson and Green and the same year of birth. The youngest of the “lost generation” served as vanguard leaders of the baby-boomers. It was also the year that Tommy was born in the Who&#8217;s rock cantata. A boy born in 1941 who was a spiritual savior (It&#8217;s a boy Mrs Walker, it&#8217;s a boy!) (The story loosely based on the encounter with the gurus in the 1960’s).</p>
<p>On first thought, we might be glad that modern Judaism follows Mendelsohnn&#8217;s <em>Jerusalem</em> by not have required dogma checked in this sense of a group of bishops deciding what a theologian should say. Yet, we do have reviewers and institutional voices that are just as effective. Notice how much Green felt Landes was acting as a censor or decider of who is a heretic. And the repercussions of this debate will be felt in American theological circles, even Jewish ones.</p>
<p>Here are selections from the 24 page condemnation, notice the parallels to Green. What are the implications of this debate for Jewish thought?</p>
<blockquote><p>In the light of the Holocaust and other horrendous evils, modem theism found itself unable to defend belief in its “omnipotent, omniscient Supreme Being” (52)<br />
 <br />
Later in her book, Sr. Johnson advocates an understanding of God that implies that the ﬁnite order is ontologically constitutive of God’s being. It is this view of God, which she identiﬁes as &#8220;panentheism,&#8221; that allows her to predicate suffering to God as such. It is only<br />
because God partakes of the ﬁnite order that the suffering within the ﬁnite order redounds to him. However, such an understanding undermines God’s transcendence in that God’s manner of existence, as Creator, would no longer differ in kin</p>
<p>The panentheism espoused by Sr. Johnson, however, fails to respect not only the transcendent integrity of God, but also the integrity of the created order, for in this view the ﬁnite created order ﬁnds its value not in its own created being, possessing its own inherent created value, but in being ontologically constitutive of God’s own being. Read the <a href="http://www.usccb.org/doctrine/statement-quest-for-the-living-god-2011-03-24.pdf">whole 24 pages here.</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the events from NCR; notice how pedestrian this write up is compared to the actual contradictory charges of panentheism, Kantianism, mysticism, and post-Holocaust theology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite that conclusion, the bishops did not call for any disciplinary measures against Johnson, such as a ban on teaching or publishing. Johnson, 69, is a distinguished professor of systematic theology at the Jesuit-run Fordham University in New York.<br />
According to the statement, the committee felt compelled to publicly denounce Johnson’s 2007 book Quest for the Living God because it is directed to a “broad audience,” and because it’s being used in many venues “as a textbook for the study of God.”</p>
<p>When it appeared, Quest for the Living God drew praise in many quarters for sketching new understandings of God based on various contemporary intellectual currents, including political, liberation, feminist, black, Hispanic, interreligious, and ecological theologies. </p>
<p>The statement, however, asserts that the book reaches many conclusions which are “theologically unacceptable.”  The Committee on Doctrine of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is chaired by Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C. Though dated March 24, its statement on Johnson’s book was released today.</p>
<p>The 21-page statement from the doctrine committee outlines seven categories of problems in the book.<br />
First, at the level of method, the statement accuses Johnson of questioning core elements of traditional Christian theology, including its understanding of God as “incorporeal, impassible, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.” Doing so, the statement asserts, is “seriously to misrepresent the tradition and so to distort it beyond recognition.”</p>
<p>Second, the statement faults Johnson for treating language about God in the Bible and in church tradition as largely metaphorical, implying that truth about God is essentially “unknowable.” Even if mysteries such as the Trinity and the Incarnation can never be fully grasped, the statement says, they can nevertheless be “known.” While Johnson bases part of her argument on early church fathers, according to the statement, her position actually has more in common with Immanuel Kant and “Enlightenment skepticism.”</p>
<p>Third, the statement asserts that in talking about the “suffering” of God, Johnson actually undermines God’s transcendence, suggesting that God differs only in degree, not in kind, from other beings.</p>
<p>Fourth, according to the statement, Johnson advocates new language about God not based on its truth but its socio-political utility. In particular, she argues that all-male language about God perpetuates “an unequal relationship between women and men,” and thus has become “religiously inadequate.” In fact, according to the statement, male imagery about God found in scripture and tradition “are not mere human creations that can be replaced by others that we may find more suitable.”</p>
<p>Fifth, the statement asserts that Johnson’s emphasis on the presence of the Holy Spirit in non-Christian religions “denies the uniqueness of Jesus as the Incarnate Word.” In effect, according to the statement, Johnson’s argument suggests that for the fullness of truth about God, “one needs Jesus + Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, etc.”, a position it says is “contrary to church teaching.”</p>
<p>Sixth, the statement says, Johnson’s treatment of God as Creator ends in pantheism, undercutting the traditional understanding of God as “radically different from creation.”</p>
<p>Seventh, the statement faults Johnson’s understanding of the Trinity. Johnson treats traditional language about God as three persons as symbolic, according to the statement, thereby undercutting the church’s belief that “Jesus is ontologically the eternal Son of the Father.”<br />
In its conclusion, the statement says the root problem with Johnson’s book is that it “does not take the faith of the church as its starting point.”</p>
<p>“It effectively precludes the possibility of human knowledge of God through divine revelation,” the statement says, “and reduces all names and concepts of God to human constructions that are to be judged not on their accuracy … but on their social and political utility.” <a href="http://ncronline.org/print/23780">Read Full story here</a> and it has links to documents and articles. </p></blockquote>
<p>Charge that the bishops office is misreading the document:</p>
<blockquote><p>The document accuses Johnson of wanting to “replace” masculine names for God with feminine ones. Johnson never says any such thing. “Are they [the bishops on the committee] doing so much reading between the lines they’re overlooking what the lines themselves say?” Mollie asked. That’s certainly possible. But I wonder whether they’ve read the book at all.<br />
Take, for example, this passage from Quest:</p>
<p><em>All fruitful metaphors have sufficiently complex grids of meaning at the literal level to allow for extension of thought beyond immediate linkages. That is why God can be seen as a king, rock, mother, savior, gardener, lover, father, liberator, midwife, judge, helper, friend, mother bear, fresh water, fire, thunder, and so on.</em><br />
And this:</p>
<p><em>God is not literally a father or a king or a lord but something ever so much greater. Thus is the truth more greatly honored. This is not to say that male metaphors cannot be used to signify the divine. Men, too, are created, redeemed, and sanctified by the gracious love of God, and images taken from their lives can function in as adequate or inadequate a way as do images taken from the lives of women…. If God is a “he” as well as a “she”—and in fact neither—a new possibility can be envisioned of a community that honors the difference but allows women and men to share life in equal measure.</em></p>
<p>As anyone who has read the book can tell, Johnson has no interest in dumping male images of God in favor of female ones. She wants us to consider both. <a href="http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/blog/?p=12856">Read the rest here. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a blog <a href="http://witheology.wordpress.com/tag/elizabeth-johnson/">Women in Theology</a> that has extensive coverage of the debate, along with reflections and defenses.</p>

				<p>Someone sent me an interesting old JTA posting about the attempt in 1926 to create an American Sanhedrin by <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0019_0_19663.html">Rabbi Chaim Tchernowitz</a>, the Religious Zionist thinker. (RZ is one of my 14 types of MO and it existed in 3 continents). The speech was also covered in much less detail by the NYT. Prof. Tchernowitz, was the maggid shiur at Rav Reines’ Yeshiva in Odessa and then sought refuge by teaching at JIR in NY. He wrote many interesting works such as Toldot Haposkim and a very interesting autobiography.  Just reading this speech you can get a sense of the 1910’s and 1920’s hock that he provides.</p>
<p>Between WWI and 1951, most Religious Zionist leadership was in NY because it was too hard to make a living in the yishuv. Rav Tzair wanted one rabbinic body to unite the three American religious movements in order to return everyone to Torah.</p>
<p>This speech was given at <em>Chavrutha</em>, the Jewish intellectuals club, lead <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_20904.html">Peter Wiernik</a>, who sought to create an Yiddishist anti-Zionist modern Orthodoxy. (It is not one of my 14 types because Yiddishist Dubnov modern Orthodoxy never caught on.) However, Weirnik’s papers are in the YU archives waiting for MA thesis and he has an autobiography.</p>
<p>JTA October 26, 1926<br />
<strong>Rabbinic Council to Revise Religious Laws on Basis of Tradition Proposed for U. S.</strong></p>
<p>The creation in the United States of a rabbinical council which would be endowed with authority to interpret, in accordance with the spirit of Jewish traditions, the Biblical and Talmudic laws in accordance with the requirements of the time, was the suggestion put forward by Professor Chaim Tchernowitz, at the last meeting of the Chavrutha, a Jewish intellectuals club, held at the Broadway Central Hotel. Peter Wiernik, editor of the &#8220;Jewish Morning Journal&#8221; and president of the Club, was in the chair.</p>
<p>The suggestion of Dr. Tchernowitz, who is known in Hebrew literature under the nom de plume of &#8220;Rav Zair&#8221; and is professor of Talmud and Rabbinics at the Jewish Institute of Religion, stirred the audience.</p>
<p>Professor Tchernowitz presented his conclusions as a summary of his observations of Jewish life in the United States during the past three years. All three parties of American Jewry, the Orthodox, the Reform<br />
and the Conservative according to the speaker have embarked on a road which is not in accordance with the development of the essence of Jewish law. The most important place in Jewish life in the United States is now occupied by the prayer book and the synagogue, which are, viewed from the angle of historic development and judged by the place these were accorded in olden times, rather less significant and at any rate non-essential in the general scheme of things Jewish, he declared.</p>
<p>Reviewing the history of the development of the Halakah and citing a number of instances in the Halakah in which the Sages have interpreted and amended the original Biblical law in accordance with the spirit of this law, rendered necessary by changing conditions, Dr. Tchernowitz pointed to the fact that Jewish Orthodoxy in the United States is developing into a party instead of maintaining the position of the original reservoir of Jewish thought and leadership. When the prayer book and the synagogue building are the center of interest and when Orthodoxy is becoming stagnant and is being transformed into a party, it is not surprising that it is not led by the rabbis, the leaders of thought, but by the congregational presidents, or the political leaders, he stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional Judaism,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;had this quality that while it maintained the essence of the revealed tradition, it nevertheless allowed development. Laws, as they are known in human history, are of a two-fold origin: one is of revealed religion or divine inspiration,<br />
the other of human legislation. The first, revealed religion, cannot be changed, except by the same process; the other can be changed by the legislators. The Torah from its very beginning had the religion<br />
and legislation. This found expression in the principle that while the basic foundation is of divine origin, its application was left in the hands of the scholars. &#8216;Everything which any devoted scholar is destined to introduce was handed down to Moses.&#8217; This is one of the<br />
determining outlooks of Jewish law. The Biblical commandment of &#8216;According to the Torah which they will instruct thee&#8217; embodies the combination of the two channels of legislation. Orthodoxy, in ignoring this circumstance, has placed itself in the difficult position in which it is now. The fact of the matter is, all the inventions based on modern science, such as electricity, the telephone, the telegraph, rapid transportation and the radio, greatly affecting the life of modern man, have been introduced after the close of the &#8216;Schulchan Aruch.&#8217; A revision of the Sabbath law, for instance, toward these inventions, is a matter of imperative necessity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is also great need for a revision of the law with regard to marriage, divorce and in matters of Agunoth (women who have lost track of their husbands) and Chalitzah (the ancient rite practiced when the husband dies without progeny).&#8221;</p>
<p>The Jewish reform movement in the United States was also discussed by the speaker. &#8220;In all history of religion,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the reform movements were motivated by strong faith and the urge to greater piety. The Karaites insisted that the rabbis were too liberal in the interpretation of the Bible and renouncing the Talmud urged a return to the source, which meant the strict enforcement of the letter of the law. Also the Chassidic movement which has laid emphasis on religious enthusiasm could be regarded as a reform movement which rebelled against the stagnation of the religious laws among the rabbinic &#8216;Mithnagdim.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the history of Christianity, the reform movements were brought about through similar motives. The only exception is the Jewish reform movement. It did not spring out of faith, but out of a desire for adaptation. The reform movement is not based on faith nor on any<br />
particular philosophy. The reform movement, contending, on one hand, that Judaism is a religion but not a nationality and, on the other hand, basing its theory on the idea of &#8220;a Jewish mission, created a situation of contradictio in objecto and is wrangling with irreconcilable theological contradictions. The present day advocates of reform have entirely deviated from the path outlined by the founders like Geiger and his contemporaries, who wanted to establish reform Judaism on the basis of historic Judaism. The sermons of the reform preachers and rabbis in the United States are mainly of a secular and political character and are not permeated with Jewish religious thoughts. Some of these sermons even go into regions totally outside of Judaism.</p>
<p>&#8220;To add to its troubles, there is no leading thought which is binding for all rabbis. The reform movement in the United States apparently adheres to the other half of the previously quoted sentence. They leave out &#8216;according to the Torah,&#8217; but they practice &#8216;as they will instruct thee.&#8217; Each reform rabbi chooses what he finds expedient and &#8216;instructs&#8217; as he sees fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Conservatives are,&#8221; Dr. Tchernowitz said, &#8220;a fifty-fifty proposition. The Conservative congregations have neither the contents of the Orthodox nor the freedom of the Reform. Emphasis is laid by them on the Siddur (prayer book) which is indeed a non-essential in Jewish life. When the sources are consulted, it appears that the Siddur and the synagogue ritual are the latest and the least significant parts of Judaism,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great temples were converted by the cantors into a sort of cheap opera, where the music, which is mostly non-Jewish and an imitation of secular melodies lacking in proper taste and religious feeling, occupies the central place to which prayer is merely of secondary importance. These temples are becoming more and more empty, they are not frequented by the youth, who do not find there any religious inspiration. Historic Judaism centered more around the Beth Ha&#8217;midrash, the house of learning, around learning and not around the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Tchernowitz concluded his discourse by expressing his opinion that in previous periods, although the law was considered &#8220;closed&#8221; there was a &#8220;silent consent&#8221; on the choice of one or several rabbinic authorities with whom rested the power of decision. But this type of<br />
the Gaon has disappeared never to return. In these times of modern democracy the only way to insure the continuity of Jewish law and Jewish tradition and to fuse the three sections which sail without direction is to create a &#8220;Beth Din Ha&#8217;Gadol&#8221; to revise Jewish religious laws in accordance with the spirit of historical Judaism.<br />
Such a council would thus be given the authority and all sections would adhere to its opinions, he stated.</p>
<p>Mr. Moses Stoll, well known New York Talmudist, in a learned discourse opposed the views of Dr. Tchernowitz, arguing that no matter what innovations the Jewish religious law experienced in the course of its development and no matter what other innovations might be necessary, they were accomplished and can be accomplished only &#8220;within the circle.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I have just been quoted about my supposed views and I dont recognize it and agree with little of it. So you are needlessly keeping me up tonight to respond. (gezel shanah!)I am usually online- you and others can always contact me to fact check first to see if you are correct. </p>
<blockquote><p>Some, such as Professor Alan Brill, now divide the American Orthodox community into three wings: haredi, CO and MO, where the CO straddle the ideological divide between right and left. In other words, in addition to being stricter in halakhic observance, the CO are more skeptical of the MO values described above. Some call this middle camp “gray” or “gray hat,” connoting a kind of diluted version of haredism.</p>
<p>According to Brill, CO has a more conservative religious ideology than that of philosophical MO. Moreover, beginning in the 1980’s, children from MO homes have become increasingly CO, partly as a result of their study in Israel post-high school. As a result, a generational shift is gradually condemning the philosophical MO to extinction.</p>
<p>But there are problems with Brill’s analysis. While the changes he documents are real, they seem minor relative to the overall continuity between philosophical MO and CO. Moreover, the generational shift suggests that this new ideology is nothing more than a new generation’s version of their parents’ MO, sort of a MO 2.0. Third, Brill sees CO as a uniquely American phenomenon; yet there are striking parallels in the Israeli equivalent of MO, which has also shifted toward more scrupulous observance of Halakha, more obedience to rabbinic authorities and more distance from secular culture.</p>
<p>Why the MO of the 60’s and 70’s changed is a question deserving a separate post. But the changes MO underwent point to larger cultural trends that include rising affluence, a more assertive rabbinic class and changes in the zeitgeist. In any case, no one will argue with Brill’s central point – that the MO community has moved right over the last 40 years. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Feh! Yuck! </strong><br />
Let me start with the last point, I do not think that the community has turned right. I go out of my way to avoid ever saying that. I even avoid it on the blog. I leave right and left for politics and Hegelians. (I have the word once in one article-it was added by an editor). I emphasize difference and change not right or left. </p>
<p>I find the Centrist community and ideology of the community more acculturated into Americanism, popular culture, and suburbia. It also has parallels with the Evangelicals. That is a specific pattern of combining Orthodoxy with modern life. I do not see Centrist as closer or further from either modern Orthodoxy or Haredi or &#8220;engaged yehivish.&#8221; It is its own ideology. I do not see it as more or less religious than any other group. I have 100&#8217;s of posts here trying to create a thick description of the workings of Centrism. </p>
<p>Now back to the beginning. No, No, No. I do not see three groups out there. I leave that for online quizzes and hockers. I have never discussed hats or sociological continuities.</p>
<p>If we are talking philosophic or ideological trends, then I see about 12-14 groups within Modern Orthodoxy. Their differences are not right and left but canon, genealogy, ideal, and goal. The most important one that some have already picked up on is &#8220;engaged yeshivish.&#8221; That would be an essential category.<br />
The full 12-14 groups would include as a category the still inchoate &#8220;open orthodoxy,&#8221; the pedigreed  &#8220;European community orthodoxy&#8221; and Israeli imports &#8220;New Religious Zionists&#8221; and &#8220;Hardal.&#8221; They are philosophic or theological trends so one person can be connected to more than one. I repeat, one person can be connected to more than one of them the same way a person can be connected to more than one philosophy, political theory, or theology. And I certainly dont arrange them on any spectrum. I certainly did not mention a correlation with strictness of observance or laxity. </p>
<p>As a sociologist, one needs to create a study that has predictive value. Most of the hock is not sociology and has no real correlation between observance and group.</p>
<p>If we talk about sociology of the community, then first tell me what form of sociology or demographic you are using. Sociology measures social behavior, an institution, or a demographic. Then we have to discuss what are you using to create your set, frame analysis, an institution, or a neighborhood. I think the author is confusing me with the sociologists who discuss &#8220;sliding to the right.&#8221; On a popular level especially on the blogs, ideology and sociology are confused.  Observance levels may or may not have anything to do with a given ideology.</p>
<p>I do not come to this not as a sociologist, and am not answering sociological questions. Rather as an intellectual historian, or student of contemporary relgion.</p>
<p>If we are dealing with social organization, then  mid-twentieth century documents used to write &#8220;the Young Israel movement” “the Agudah movement” The Conservative movement” “The Mizrachi movement” or the “Bnai Brith movement.” In that sense Centrism and the older Modern Orthodoxy are one movement. </p>
<p>The term modern orthodox has three distinct meanings in our context.<br />
(There are more meanings but not in our context. For example, the term was first used in the 1920&#8217;s for synagogues that were mixed seating and had English preaching eventually leading them to become Conservative.)<br />
The first meaning is the coiners of the term, the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s modern rabbis. They called themselves modern (small m) and Orthodox. Then it was an ideology because the sociology of the synagogues were simply called Orthodox. They thought it applied to a few dozen rabbis.<br />
The second meaning is that in the 1970&#8217;s and 1980&#8217;s the term was applied to a social group that went to certain school, camps, and a specific university- they called themselves Modern (capital M) and Orthodox. Those who lived in certain neighborhoods or had certain professional and family profiles were now Modern Orthodox. But the ideologies and religious practices of these communities were so varied and diverse, the term became a catch-all still subject to debate and hock.<br />
The third meaning which is the one that I am most interested in- is that many groups since the late 18th century have mediated both modern and Orthodox. The term was invented in the US but we can use it to discuss diverse phenomena in many countries. I am not interested and dont know &#8220;who&#8221; is modern Orthodox but I am interested in &#8220;what&#8221; is modern Orthodox. Especially,how it works, and what forms of hybrid, acculturation, synthesis, and bifurcation are created. </p>
<p>Now, to the middle point. Centrism may or may not be just MO 2.0. But if it has more continuity or more break it needs to be discussed in a context of different versions of ideology and with clear criteria for what is continuity and break. My sole interest is ideology and theology to determine these ideological distinctions. If you want to discuss other questions of continuity and break: Is Isaac Breuer&#8217;s Agudah Neo-Orthodoxy  a theological continuity or a break with Hirsch&#8217;s Israel-Mentsch. (I am not discussing hat color or what they ate out.) Are the Datiim Ha-Hadashim a break or a continuity with Kibbutz Hadati ideology of SHaL or from that of 1960&#8217;s Mizrachi? Is Italian traditionalism, the same as that of chief rabbi British, or cathedral American?</p>
<p>You write &#8220;the CO are more skeptical of the MO values.&#8221; How do you know that? I certainly have no interest in ascribing motivations or even recording motivations- a path filled with the danger of projection at every turn. I treat groups as discrete entities.   </p>
<p>And as a final coda, I dont lump all Haredim together. They have many separate ideologies with clear distinctions.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>

				<p>There is an April Fool&#8217;s joke of a legal blogger writing a phony abstract for a legal paper by <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r"> Richard A. Posner</a>. The latter is the important legal theorist of free-market economics as the basis for American law, Judge, 7th Court of Appeal, and  University of Chicago Law School. The April fool&#8217;s paper is a free-market theory of what God does and why houses of worship are needed. Even though it is a joke it makes a lot of sense of a classic theism in modern terms. It can serve as a contemporary restatement of theistic reward and punishment theology such as Saadyah in American terms.<br />
Here is the [phony] abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>This article presents a positive economic theory of the behavior of supernatural beings or deities. The essay addresses a well known problem in the conventional theological account of a supreme being that is omnipotent and omniscient. Given omnipotence, the state of the world should be identical with the state most favored by the preference structure of the deity. But rational choice theory is the positive theory that a rational actor will act so as to maximize the satisfaction of its preferences. Given omnipotence and omniscience, it follows that all states of affairs already accord with the preferences of an omnipotent and omniscient deity, leading to the paradoxical conclusion that rational action by such an entity is impossible.</p>
<p>The model proposed in this article resolves this paradox by invoking the familiar notion of &#8220;free will.&#8221; By creating beings with free will, a rational deity creates conditions in which it is possible for the deity to act rationally by interacting with creatures that it creates which have free will (who thus can act in ways that do not accord with the the deity&#8217;s preferences). On this model, a deity acts rationally when it acts in ways that induce creatures with free will to satisfy the deity&#8217;s preferences. For example, a deity might demand some act of sacrifice, reverence, or obedience and then threaten to punish creatures that do not satisfy these demands. Such threats might be made credible by actions that demonstrate the power of the deity to create plagues, floods, and other natural disasters visited upon those who are disobedient or irreverent.</p>
<p>This model provides a theoretical alternative to the common view of divine beings as Prometheans or saints, and it suggests new ways of looking at such practical issues as the design of religious institutions that can produce human behavior that will avoid the deleterious consequences that attend punitive actions by omnipotent deities. The author expresses no opinion on the question whether such entities actually exist. <a href="http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2011/04/posner-on-the-economics-of-theology.html">source is here at Lawrence B. Solum</a>, <a href="http://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2011/04/what-do-deities-maximize.html">h/t here</a>. </p></blockquote>

				<p>This was just posted on the Catholic websites- it will be posted on the Israeli websites after Shabbat. In the meantime <a href="http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=214709">here is the jpost writeup</a>. I was going to only post selected paragraphs but it is so short that I posted the whole thing. These things dont usually make the American Jewish papers.</p>
<p>BILATERAL COMMISSION MEETING OF THE DELEGATIONS OF THE CHIEF RABBINATE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOLY SEE’S COMMISSION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH THE JEWS(JERUSALEM MARCH 29-31, 2011; ADAR II, 23-25, 5771) JOINT STATEMENT</p>
<p>1. The Bilateral Commission of the delegations of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews held its tenth meeting to discuss the Challenges of Faith and Religious Leadership in Secular Society. The meeting opened with a moment of silence in memory of Chief Rabbi Yosef Azran who had been a member of the Chief Rabbinate’s delegation for many years. Chief Rabbi Shear Yashuv Cohen, co-chairman of the Bilateral Commission, welcomed the participants and reaffirmed the historic nature and importance of these meetings.  His counterpart Cardinal Jorge Mejia brought the greetings of the Cardinal Kurt Koch, recently appointed President of the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, to the delegates.  The Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Yona Metzger, graced the meeting and expressed his strong support and encouragement for the work of the Bilateral Commission, acknowledging its impact on the positive change in perceptions of Jewish-Christian relations in Israeli society.  </p>
<p>2.Deliberations sought to define the challenges that modern secular society faces.  In addition to its many benefits; rapid technological advancement, rampant consumerism, and a nihilistic ideology with an exaggerated focus on the individual at the expense of the community and collective wellbeing, have led to a moral crisis.  Together with the benefits of emancipation, the last century has witnessed unparalleled violence and barbarity.  Our modern world is substantially bereft of a sense of belonging, meaning and purpose.</p>
<p><strong>3.Faith and religious leadership have a critical role in responding to these realities, in providing both hope and moral guidance derived from the awareness of the Divine Presence and the Divine Image in all human beings.  Our respective traditions declare the importance of prayer, both as the expression of awareness of the Divine Presence, and as the way to affirm that awareness and its moral imperatives. In addition, the study of the Divine Word in Scripture offers the essential inspiration and direction for life. The Biblical description of Moses (Exodus 3:1-15) was presented as a paradigm of religious leadership who, through his encounter with God, responds to the Divine call with total faith, loving his people, declaring the Word of God without fear, embodying freedom and courage, and an authority that comes from obeying God always and unconditionally, and listening to all, ready for dialogue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.The responsibility of the faithful is accordingly to testify to the Divine Presence in our world, (Isaiah 43:10) while acknowledging our failures in the past to be true and full witnesses to this charge.</strong> <strong>Such testimony is also to be seen in education, focus on youth and effective engagement of the media. Similarly, in the establishment and operation of charitable institutions with special care for the vulnerable, sick and marginalized, in the spirit of ‘tikkun olam’ (healing the world).  In addition, the religious commitment to justice and peace also requires an engagement between religious leadership and the institutions of civil law. </strong></p>
<p>5.Modern secular society has brought with it many benefits. Indeed, if secular is understood in terms of a broad-based engagement of society at large, this is likely to provide for a society in which religion can flourish.  Furthermore the above mentioned focus on the individual has brought much blessing and led to an overwhelming attention to the subject of civil rights.  However, in order for such a focus to be sustainable, it needs to be rooted in a higher anthropological and spiritual framework that takes into account “the common good”, which finds its expression in the religious foundation of moral duties.  Society’s affirmation of such human duties, serves to empower and enshrine the human rights of its constituents.</p>
<p> 6.Resulting from the discussion on the practical implications for religious leadership in relationship to current issues, the Bilateral Commission expressed the hope that the outstanding matters in the negotiations between the Holy See and the State of Israel would soon be resolved, and bilateral agreements speedily ratified for the benefit of both communities.</p>
<p><strong> The Catholic delegation took the opportunity to reiterate the historic teaching of the Second Vatican Council’s declaration Nostra Aetate (No.4) regarding the Divine Covenant with the Jewish People that “the Jews still remain most dear to God because of their Fathers, for He, does not repent of the gifts He makes, nor of the calls He issues (cf. Romans 11:28-29)”; and recalled the prayer for peace of Pope Benedict XVI when receiving the Bilateral Delegation in Rome on March 12 2009, quoting Psalm 125 “As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people, from this time forth and for evermore.”</strong></p>
<p> Jerusalem<br />
