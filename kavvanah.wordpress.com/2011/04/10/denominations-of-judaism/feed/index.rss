					<description><![CDATA[I like &quot;streams&quot;.  Streams gather tributaries, and flow into rivers, so it doesn&#039;t connote a singular centralized organization.  Movement tends to connote a singular organization, devoted to one or a set of ideas - the Free Speech Movement, the Reform Movement (now Union for Reform Judaism), etc.

I like R Micha Berger&#039;s idea, that Orthodoxy is not a movement, but is a property of various movements: Modern, Mussar, various Chasidish, Yeshivish (their grand rebbe is RYSE?), lehavdil Sabbatean, etc., each with their own institutions.  

 Conservative and Reform are more centralized, at least in this country - they have singular congregational (USCJ/URJ), rabbinic (RA/CCAR), and educational (HUC/JTSA[/UJ what used to be JTS-LA]) organizations.]]></description>
