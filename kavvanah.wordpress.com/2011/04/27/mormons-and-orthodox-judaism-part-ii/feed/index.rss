					<description><![CDATA[Do you happen to know if there is any relationship between the terms: &#039;Avodah Zarah&#039; (mentioned in your article), and the name &#039;Zarah&#039; (a Child of Judah and Tamar)?

I am concerned that the concept of &#039;Avodah Zarah&#039;, may tend to make a group &#039;clannish&#039;.  How can the doctrines of the Great Patriarchs, bless the nations - and yet still be clannish - at the same time?

Do you accept the notion, that the descendants of Zarah, made it to England?  http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GPCK_enUS372US372&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=zerah+judah+]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot; The obvious answer is that the common ground of family values, conservative politics, and banning gay marriage overcomes little things like the principles of faith.&quot;

As I think was at least alluded to in the comments to the previous post, I think it is more subtle than that.  What you list applies to many protestant groups as well.  
But with Mormons, there is also commonality in (1) having a religion with a fairly complicated and obscure-to-outsiders set of rules &lt;i&gt;and practices&lt;/i&gt;, about which one has been the target of ill-will and persecution in the recent past and for which one therefore mostly wants to be left alone (by both secularists and evangelicals) rather than evangelize/publicize, and (2) being a (generally) white-looking religious minority (seemingly?) overrepresented in the well-paying professions.

(I realize the mormom mission goes against what i say re: &quot;rather than evangelize,&quot; but I think it is still true that in american politics mormons have a &quot;leave us and our peculiarities alone&quot; streak rather than a &quot;be like us and adopt our pecluiarities&quot; streak.)]]></description>
