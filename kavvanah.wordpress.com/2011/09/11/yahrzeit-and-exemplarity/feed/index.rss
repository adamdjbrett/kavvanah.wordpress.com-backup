					<description><![CDATA[I say go for it!

Though given the vagaries of the Jewish calendar, it might work better as a blog and app than as a printed book.

As to R&#039; Simcha:

&#062; “Just as a person must find for himself a teacher in this world, so too a person must find for himself a teacher in the next World.”

I confess I don&#039;t understand this. What does this mean?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From the responses I got over the years, I would guess that publisher is not (and was not) correct.  People are fascinated by people, in my experience.  I would note yahrzeits and other historical markers in my HS teaching, and with adult audiences.  It never failed to draw people in, getting them to see history and a chain of tradition as occurring through real people.  Mind, I didn&#039;t focus only on tzadikim; but the majority were religious figures.  When we did a monthly melave malka I used to present yahrzeits and historical occurrences for the coming month, and it always got interest.

So, I think folks find people inherently interesting, and also as models, and also as an entry into a historical event, development, or period.]]></description>
