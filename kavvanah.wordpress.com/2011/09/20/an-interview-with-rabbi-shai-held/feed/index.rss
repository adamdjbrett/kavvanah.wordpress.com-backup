					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&#062;I am not interested in being boxed into some small sliver “between Conservative and Orthodox.”&lt;/i&gt;

At the first LimmudNY in &#039;05, Rabbi Held gave a lecture comparing Rahner&#039;s Anonymous Christianity to Rav Kook&#039;s view of secular Zionists in Israel, and the similarity of the criticism that both figure&#039;s ideas received. During the Q&#038;A, he and Rabbi Steve Greenberg (in the audience) shared a light-hearted exchange which basically went as follows:
&lt;b&gt;SG: ...well, that&#039;s because you&#039;re actually an Orthodox Jew in a Conservative body.
ShH: And you&#039;re a Conservative Jew in an Orthodox body! &lt;/b&gt;

Well, I guess that settles it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/09/20/an-interview-with-rabbi-shai-held/#comment-3629&quot;&gt;Isaac Shalev (@rejewvenator)&lt;/a&gt;.

Maybe there is no broader &quot;laity.&quot; Hadar is its own community, Hartman has spawned communities and is made up of scholars who belong to different communities. Rejecting denominationalism is as much about rejecting a label as acknowledging that you are not going to liberalize Orthodoxy or revive Conservatism and that setting that up as a goal is a waste of energy. Do your own thing and if people import some of your ideas into their communities than good. If not, then it&#039;s not your failure because that wasn&#039;t the impossible goal that you set out for yourself.

People aren&#039;t just sick of denominations, they are sick of having to deal with people with whom they share the same denomination but have nothing to talk about. The goal, to appropriate the the quip, is to daven with the people you can talk to, and talk to the people you daven with, because talking (in other words, fostering a community) IS as important as davening.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is Hadar&#039;s vision lived out in any Jewish community? Who turns to Mechon Hadar for definitive halachic, moral, and religious guidance? I love Hadar and I have tremendous admiration for Rabbi Held, and Rabbis Tucker and Kaunfer, but I have a sinking feeling that they&#039;re the Hartman Institute, Part II - a wonderful collection of scholars and thinkers who are simply unable to gain traction within the broader laity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting juxtaposition with the previous piece on “Asking the Big Questions today on a college campus”.  Hadar and JLF have some commonality in promoting Jewish Literacy – but, seem to diverge in both style and application.

Perhaps both approaches are needed, Hadar for introverts; JLF for extroverts???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;&#062;Also, I’m really not sure I know what the words Orthodox and Conservative mean in this day and age. Does Orthodox refer to Satmar or to Zvi Yehudah? Does it refer to the Bratzlav of Shuvu Banim, the legal formalism of R. Bleich or the dynamic Halakha in the tradition of Rav Uziel and Rav Hayyim David Halevy, the Misnagdic yeshiva world of Rav Eliyashiv or the post-modern neo-Hasidus of Rav Shagar? &lt;/em&gt;

There are those that understand denomination in ideological terms, and those who understand denomination in communal terms. There are surely other ways of understanding denominational divides. My point is that even if there is very little ideological sense in dividing Orthodox and Conservative (and, come to think of it, surely there is!) it is sensible to talk about two very different communities. Orthodox communities have certain features, strengths and flaws, and so do Conservative communities. 

By seeing everything in ideological terms, I wonder if Hadar lacks the resources to truly build a community for those who don&#039;t put matters of intellect first. It&#039;s one thing to tell Ivy League grads that they should free themselves of their communal, ideological assumptions. It&#039;s quite another to build a community populated by bankers, construction workers and professors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like how R Held gave us the inner workings of his thought process, especially the pieces on how he reads Heschel. 
Would love to hear more discussion of aesthetics, which seems irreducible, on the one hand. And then the class dynamics and economic underpinnings of the thing on the other. But this is a much better start to discussing Hadar than previous attempts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One reason I find Rabbi Held’s ideas so appealing is that the approach is study, passing what they are calling in finance, stress tests.  I can find Rabbi Heschel’s  prose too rapturous for my taste, I can come from a Reform or Charedi background, I can even prefer a shtibel with a kidush club, and the structure, the general schema  remains stable. The basic idea as I understand it involves three features… a religious  Jewish culture  centered on traditional texts read and interpreted in a modern open way, an ideal of universal human well being and mutual responsibility, and a sense of possibility and a commitment  to moral progress, whether through chesed, egalitarianism, political action, etc.  Unlike Arthur Green’s approach that very much hangs on the value of kabbalah and chasidus, the Hadar derech has room for analytical halachic and philosophical reasoning. It is more of a project than an accomplished closed system, which for me is a big plus. It can accommodate the past of  psychoanalysis and Continental philosophy, and is flexible enough to incorporate at least  some of the ideas yet to come,  so that Jewish learning and thinking always remains new and alive.

My problem is similar to Zizek’s complaint about modern sexuality. He said somewhat jokingly that the internalized command  of having an active, hedonistic, sexual life is even more difficult than following the old rules of Puritan repression. Looking how Rabbi Held dots the i’s and  crosses the t’s, I feel I would end up with an even more repressive and demanding superego than under the old dogmatic regime. It is way too serious, too heavy, too perfect. Where is neginah and humor and a light handed approach to life? Where is ironic distance and cynical wisdom? Where is gossip and being bitchy? If we are going to talk of transformations of narcissism, we must include such possibilities as well. Being concerned with the Other because both Levinas and a midrash agree is just moralizing. Avodah is not just top down beating yourself up in ever more complex ways. It is allowing each of us to have a sense of fun and pleasure in being alive and very imperfect. There are many strategies of giving up on narcissistic grandiosity. Being Jewishly perfect is as such self defeating. It makes one ‘hold from oneself’ even more.  Vtzarich iyun...]]></description>
