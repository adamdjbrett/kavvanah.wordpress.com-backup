					<description><![CDATA[Alan,
That is indeed a lovely reference.  At the same time I would note that within Israeli hasidic influenced religious-Zionist frameworks (and certainly Neo-Breslov ones) dancing is no longer a circular affair.  On the contrary, increasingly common is the sight of yeshivah boys jumping, twirling and skipping individually to their own muse. I am often reminded of one of my favorite parts of Umberto Eco&#039;s Foucault&#039;s Pendulum, the Brazilian/Tribal church dance scene.]]></description>
