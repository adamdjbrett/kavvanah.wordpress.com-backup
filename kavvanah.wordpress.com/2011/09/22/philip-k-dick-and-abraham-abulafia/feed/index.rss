					<description><![CDATA[Well, I was also a bit puzzled by such revelation. But... as far Abu-al-Afiya means &quot;Father of Health&quot; and as far the plot of Valis is ALL about the theme of Sickness-Health (in mental dimension), one can assume - as suggested by T. Sikora - that Dick was under influence of Jerome Rothenberg &#038; co. (vide: Abulafianism Among the

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m planning on putting something along those lines in the acknowledgments of my dissertation.

Dear Committee,

This is to let you know that after many years of research and work I have
finally finished my dissertation entitled &quot;A crippling Work of Heartbreaking Procrastination.&quot; In the writing I collaborated with the spirit of the 16th century Jewish alchemist/mystic, Hayyim Vital who seizes control of me from time to time, as circumstances require, to perform elaborate internet searches on esoteric topics such as the transmutation of lead, levitation, and the best recipes for gelato.

Hope all is well with you, and my apologies for having dragged you from your long term care facilities for the defense.]]></description>
