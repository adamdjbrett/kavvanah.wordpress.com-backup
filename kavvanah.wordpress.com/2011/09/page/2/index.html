It shows the diversity of the community and the dialogue group. It also offers a better sense of what people mean by dialogue in 2011, in contrast to 1965. Now people discuss facing the challenges of diverse groups working together, issues of location and translocation, race, generation, and assimilation. The website has clips of many of <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/hopetown-teaneck-128894718.html">the segments of the documentary- here.</a> I cannot seem to copy or embed  the video here, so go to the website to watch the clips. (I will try and fix it tomorrow, any ideas on how to get it to embed? ).</p>
<blockquote><p>The Teaneck Story</p>
<p>Hope Town investigates how Americans in one New Jersey community are dealing with the problems, challenges and successes of a culturally and religiously diverse population.</p>
<p>Teaneck is a city of nearly 40,000 people in the New Jersey suburbs outside (6 km) New York City, where Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin, a Muslim, works every day with Deputy Mayor Adam Gussen, an Orthodox Jew. In some parts of the world, this relationship might be doomed to failure because of historic conflicts between Muslim and Jewish people — but not in Teaneck.</p>
<p>Could this town represent a model for the future of tolerance? Voice of America and Alhurra, an Arabic language television station that broadcasts to 26 million people in 22 Middle Eastern countries, went to Teaneck to find out.</p></blockquote>

				<p>There is a new book offering a philosophic treatment of Genocide. The book received a good reviews in the journal <em>Ethics</em> and is a required reading for those who teach anything related to Holocaust or Genocide seeking a philosophic approach. </p>
<p>The reviewer gently notes in the review “the bibliography contains no references even to philosophical papers on genocide, other than one by Larry May himself.” Hence, non-analytic works by those in Continental thought Todorov, Butler, Agamben, Appadurai, and Bauman are not interrogated.  One should also read Ben Kierman’s <em>Blood and Soil </em>for the current state of the history of genocide. </p>
<p>May deals with the philosophic definitions of what does it mean to single out a group, what is a group, and the role of agency. May’s nominalist definition of groups will refine the thinking of those who define groups, such as Jews, with essentialist and realist definitions. </p>
<blockquote><p>Larry May, Genocide: A Normative Account, Cambridge University Press, 2010, $28.99<br />
Reviewed by Chandran Kukathas, London School of Economics<br />
The Polish lawyer and Holocaust survivor, Raphael Lemkin, coined the term &#8216;genocide&#8217; in a book published in 1944 on Axis Rule in Occupied Europe.[1] Lemkin devoted his energies over the next four years to agitating for the recognition of this crime by international law and was instrumental in the drafting and eventual promulgation of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Since then, legal analysis of this controversial notion has grown as the term has come to occupy a distinctive place in law and, no less importantly, in popular discourse. Everyone knows the term &#8216;genocide&#8217;.<br />
Over the past 60 years there have been countless historical studies of particular genocides, as well as numerous comparative discussions, notably Ben Kiernan&#8217;s Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur.[2] Yet while historians, lawyers, psychologists, sociologists, political scientists and international relations theorists have published extensively on the question of genocide, philosophers have been conspicuously silent on the subject. Larry May&#8217;s study is the first substantial philosophical work on genocide.[3] This is surprising given the controversy that has surrounded the concept from its very beginnings. It is not so much that disciplinary boundaries matter, or that lawyers and historians are incapable of conceptual analysis. It is rather that there are questions that have preoccupied philosophers that are thrown into particularly sharp relief by the problem of genocide, and there is much that philosophers can contribute &#8212; and learn &#8212; by paying greater attention to this moral notion.<br />
Larry May&#8217;s philosophical study is an outstanding contribution to our understanding of genocide, as well as to our appreciation of a number of theoretical problems that are addressed in the book. Although it is a freestanding work, it is a part of a larger project that produced three other substantial Cambridge books: Crimes against Humanity: A Normative Account (2005), War Crimes and Just War (2007), and Aggression and Crimes against Peace (2008). In combination these works amount to an enormous achievement. The breadth of scholarship is impressive in itself: Professor May has mastered a substantial legal and historical literature in order to address the questions he has posed. Yet he has offered much more than a tour of extant works on war and war crimes. He set out to supply and succeeded in producing an account of the moral foundations of international criminal law. Genocide is a crucial part of the account.<br />
Larry May begins by defending a nominalist view of the idea of a group that he says is inspired by Ockham and Hobbes. From Ockham he takes the idea that groups have no independent existence, but from Hobbes he takes the idea that groups are artificial persons that can be understood as agents. <a href="http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25988-genocide-a-normative-account/">Read the Rest Here</a>.</p></blockquote>

				<p>Here is a great review of a great new book on Levinas. The book is not an introductory volume but if one has already read some Levinas and some essays about Levinas then this is one of the first books that one should pick up from a Jewish point of view. One of the local rabbi- educators even gave a shiur this summer telling over Fagenblat without attribution.</p>
<p>Michael Fagenblat, A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas&#8217;s Philosophy of Judaism, Stanford University Press, 2010, $24.95<br />
Reviewed by Kenneth Seeskin, Northwestern University</p>
<p>In the Preface to this rich and thought-provoking study, Fagenblat raises a good question: &#8220;Another book on Emmanuel Levinas?&#8221; But it does not take long for the reader to see that this volume is definitely needed. According to Fagenblat, Levinas&#8217;s fundamental project was to develop a post-Heideggarian account of ethics, which means an account that retains the binding nature of our most basic ethical intuitions. In Fagenblat&#8217;s words:Levinas sought to restore a new sense of an unconditional ethical imperative that could not be dismissed as merely abstract, formal, ahistorical, inauthentic, and ontologically inadequate. He did this by developing a phenomenology of the moral imperative that was derived not from the fact of Reason but from the face of the Other. (p. xix)</p>
<p>Against Heidegger and much of twentieth-century philosophy, Levinas was firmly convinced, as Fagenblat puts it (p. 14), that ethical judgment is exercised over history and not simply within history.</p>
<p>The problem is that for Levinas, the face of the Other is completely transcendent and thus cannot be captured by description, explanation, or narration. As Fagenblat rightly observes (p. xx), it can only be respected or desired, loved or hated. That is why Levinas thinks ethics is first philosophy: it is the source of all meaning and intelligibility and cannot be derived from anything more basic. I will postpone the question of what type of ethics this approach produces until later. For the present, the important point is that, according to Fagenblat, Levinas reaches this conclusion not by conducting an exercise in pure phenomenology but by drawing on sources from Jewish tradition. What results is in fact &#8220;a coherent philosophy of Judaism&#8221; (p. xxii).</p>
<p>… As Fagenblat sees it, critics like Badiou, Butler, Janicaud, and Rose accuse him of sneaking in religious considerations by privileging &#8220;pious and dogmatic&#8221; assertions of a non-rational Law that is immune from philosophic critique. Alternatively, Gibbs and Batnitzky accuse him of abandoning revelation by privileging Plato&#8217;s &#8220;Good beyond Being&#8221; or Kant&#8217;s Primacy of Practical Reason. For those in the first group, Levinas has no real philosophy; for those in the second, no real Judaism.</p>
<p>Fagenblat argues that both groups miss the point. &#8220;It is not a matter of collapsing Judaism . . . into philosophical discourse but of insisting on the constitutive and permanent possibility for radical interpretation of one by the other.&#8221; (p. 13) Rather than accepting a sharp dichotomy between philosophy and Judaism or Athens and Jerusalem, Fagenblat&#8217;s Levinas provides &#8220;a philosophy of Judaism without and or between.&#8221; (p. 14) The result is a deep and nuanced discussion of Levinas, </p>
<p>More specifically, Fagenblat sees a &#8220;seismic shift&#8221; between the Levinas of Totality and Infinity &#8212; Levinas 1 &#8212; and the Levinas of Otherwise than Being &#8212; Levinas 2. Whereas Levinas 1 is content to give a broadly metaphysical account of agency and transcendence that Fagenblat discusses in connection with the problem of creation, Levinas 2 offers a post-metaphysical vision, which turns out to be nothing short of a &#8220;Judaic ethical negative theology.&#8221;</p>
<p>To apprehend God is not to achieve mastery over a system of interrelated concepts but to treat one&#8217;s neighbor with the respect that is owed her. In the words of Jean-Luc Marion (cited by Fagenblat on p. 127): theology &#8220;is no longer a matter of naming or attributing something to something but rather of aiming in the direction of . . ., of relating to . . ., of composing oneself towards . . ., of reckoning with . . . &#8212; in short, of dealing with . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>Needless to say, Levinas is not as overtly theological as Maimonides. Rather than a negative theology of God, we have what one might call a negative theology of the Other. Like God in negative theology, the Other overwhelms thought, resists classification, and cannot be identified by a system of interrelated concepts. As Fabgenblat sees it, transcendence for Levinas is not something the intellect can grasp by means of properties or predicates; it is never positive and has no identifiable essence. </p>
<p>The most authentic response to transcendence is humility, which merits a whole subsection in Fagenblat&#8217;s Chapter 4. &#8220;Ethical negative theology,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;is a spiritual exercise that negates knowledge so as to acknowledge the Other.&#8221; (p. 118) It acquaints us with the finitude and partiality of anything that can be grasped by means of concepts. As Fagenblat observes, humility is a primary instance of Maimonides’ departure from Aristotle. Humility, or what Maimonides terms &#8220;lowliness of spirit,&#8221; is thus the negative theological virtue par excellence. </p>
<p>Let us now return to the question mentioned above: what kind of ethics does this approach give us? Classic thinkers like Aristotle, Kant, and Mill produced well-articulated theories with discussions of method, analysis of concepts, and elaborate accounts of the virtues.<br />
If Fagenblat is right, we should not expect Levinas&#8217;s ethics to be anything like theirs, and indeed it is not. So let us ask our question again: what kind of ethics is this that defies explanation and description? Put otherwise, if the Other is as unknowable as Levinas insists, can there be an ethics at all? The ultimate outcome of Maimonides&#8217;s negative theology is a Jobian-like silence in the presence of God. Is this all Levinas wants for the Other?</p>
<p>As Fagenblat asks, &#8220;Without a more or less determined historical horizon of others, can ethics be anything more than subjective individualism and abstract humanism?&#8221; (p. 180) The question is particularly telling because subjective individualism and abstract humanism are exactly what Levinas set out to avoid. Again we face a Scylla and Charybdis situation. To the traditional theologian, Levinas has replaced God with the Other. To the traditional ethical theorist, he has replaced a constructive account of our moral intuitions with the dogmatism of the face.</p>
<p>Fagenblat responds by saying that for Levinas there are no formal ethical concepts and no pure ethical intuitions. Instead what we have is an account of the historical conditioning of our concepts and the hermeneutical character of our intuitions; in short, &#8220;a descriptive [i.e. phenomenological] argument about who we are&#8221; (p. 196). </p>
<p>As for Fagenblat, by any relevant criterion &#8212; depth, clarity, originality, or scholarly integrity &#8212; this book is first rate. <a href="http:///ndpr.nd.edu/news/25724-a-covenant-of-creatures-levinas-s-philosophy-of-judaism/">Read the full review here.</a></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In the Spring of 2010, I spoke at the Jewish life center at a local College.  A guy came in before I started to speak handing out cards. On the cards were pictures of this guy dressed in various shades and hats to portray himself as a cool and normal- as a greaser, hipster, punk, athlete- and not the Yeshivish guy he was. He promising a free trip to Israel and money to take classes. He was obviously affiliated with the network of kiruv yeshivot in Israel. I wondered what the very informed Jewish Life center rabbi thought of this guy; I didn&#8217;t ask.</p>
<p>This year the Jewish Life center is offering its own course and paying $300. This time it is being taught by a liberal Orthodox rabbi educator who is presenting Rabbis Yitz Greenberg and David Hartman as basic Judaism. The ordained Orthodox rabbi does not purport to be teaching orthodoxy and is not interested in carrying a banner of orthodoxy in my educational practice on campus. Moreover, he does not think that orthodoxy is an appropriate educational posture for someone working in my environment.</p>
<p>Unlike the classes by kiruv organizations, these classes differentiate themselves by their pluralism.</p>
<blockquote><p>Put simply, our goal is to get you to ask “big questions” about being Jewish, not to give you “big answers.” We also have a cooler looking logo.<br />
While JLF is a program rooted in Jewish study and in Jewish community, it is open to all students.. We do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. We also make no claims about the “right” way to practice or not to practice Judaism. Our job is to help you explore the tradition in a safe space, and find your own place, on your terms, in Judaism’s Great Conversation.</p></blockquote>
<p>They are offering two classes. One on Asking Big Questions and one on Sex, Love, &amp; Intimacy. Any thoughts on the content? People are always looking for another course on being modern and observant, what do people think? How does it compare to the Shalhevet course for HS students, <a href="../../../06/26/shalhevet%E2%80%99s-modern-orthodox-education/index.html">which I posted</a>? </p>
<p>I also wonder about the bigger effect.  The course ends with the question, taken from Bellah’s <em>Habits of the Heart</em> (1985) – Is observance just a lifestyle enclave or will it be communities of memory? Twenty five years later many who expected Orthodoxy to be a community of memory found themselves in a lifestyle enclave. Even the established institutions acknowledge this is what they created. Furthermore, I know people older 10-20 years older than I am who studied with Greenberg and Hartman at YU in the 1960’s and accepted their Torah, then found themselves out of step with the lifestyle enclave. (Even the liberals are caught in the lifestyle enclave.) Is this rabbi once again promising a vision that he cannot deliver? What happens when these bright and creative college grads who consider freedom, diversity and reinterpretation to be their Judaism, then find themselves saddled with those who give out funny cards?</p>
<p>The sex ethics course may be breaking new ground in discussing pleasuring, desire and the possibility of more than two sexes and more than two genders.  (Is there a rabbinic work by a liberal rabbi that already covers this ground?)<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Years ago in my corner of academic-educational institutes in Jerusalem, people who worked in Jewish thought remembered the yahrzeit or hillula of the person on whom they were writing. They gave memorial classes or a hug bayit or a photocopied handout. During Elul, many people took note of Rav Kook’s yahrzeit on the 3rd, some noted Maharal on the 18th, and I took note of  Rav Zadok’s yahrzeit (Elul 9) followed by Reb Simcha Bunim three days later (Elul 12).</p>
<p>As this blog approaches its second anniversary, I must confess that the original idea for the blog was to post a daily yahrzeit. Since the goal of the blog was to keep me writing on other projects, a daily yahrzeit would be a chance to talk about a sefer or person. I originally envisioned starting with an Elul yahrzeit date, but I scrapped that idea.  At first, it seemed like too much continuous work and not in tune with the zigzags of  writing academic books. Second, it seemed easier to type up something I was reading or teaching on that day. And third, and probably most important, I saw so much on the internet about the Yahrzeits of these Elul deaths that was gibberish, name dropping, out-of-context, or pop-psych. I did not want to argue with those who gloried in posts of Wiki, Rambi, and Reb Shlomo stories. My goal was to have a personal board for thoughts on these figures such as why they are important. Instead, I choose the post on what I was reading. The earliest, more serious posts were on Sagi, Fishbane, and Novak-and what I was writing. That was the entire purpose of this blog. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I still like yahrzeits as a means of discussing heritage. Yahrzeits let you parade out a full gallery of potential Jewish exemplars and discuss why they are important or to argue the merits of their positions. They point to what was and is not anymore, as well as what could have been.  To discuss the many authors in Shem Hagedolim can capture lost voices and forgotten moments—they move us beyond presentism to consider other ages.  Discussing Jews under the Mamluks or Jews under the Hapsburgs does not open up a vista to a new world, as  we do not want to change our material culture. But to consider the thought of David Hanagid ben Avraham ben Rambam (Elul 1) or Maharal (Elul 18) awakens potential.</p>
<p>I am drawn to them because they offer saints, mystics, visionaries, and creative authors. They allow one to discuss the unique, the personal, the individual—all of them coming to God.  Greatest is not defined in terms of  cookie-cutter lives but rather is evaluated in terms of unique personalities. One celebrates and learns from these realized beings. I am not referring to the soul numbing contemporary gedolim tales that cauterize the intellect and emotions, rather the actual books and lives of diverse figures.</p>
<p>The source of yahrzeits goes back to late antiquity; there are several rabbinic texts that were interpreted to imply the importance of the day of the death of a great person. The Zohar speaks of the hillula when the deceased gives special influences every year on the day of their death, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Meir Baal HaNes were the most famous hillulot. Later centuries assume that one can receive inspiration or even an avatar from the deceased soul.  Customs arose of lighting candles on the yahrzeit, either fasting or having a drink, and to visit the grave for communion with the soul. It was important to mention the name of the zaddik because, as Moshe Idel showed, that in Renaissance Jewish thought there was a hermetic-magical power associated with name of the righteous. As late as 1943, the sefer <em>Zikhron</em> <em>Zaddikim</em> advocated these ideas. In addition, they taught that if one prayed for the dead, the dead will pray for you.</p>
<p>Between the 18th to 20th centuries, this approach to yahrzeits generated a genre of Jewish literature that listed at least one person’s yahrzeit daily.  Originally, one only celebrated the yahrzeit of those whom one had allegiance to their dynasty. One was either Breslov, or Tolne, or Chabad. But, with the large influx of Jews from Ukraine to Poland, from Poland to Galicia, and from Galicia to Hungary, people could pick and choose which yahrzeits to celebrate. Like Catholic saint calendars which became unmoored from their original monastic context including one’s singular alliance and evolved into reading a calendar in the city and choosing which saint to celebrate.  It also reflected the rise of Hasidic pilgrimages within Eastern Europe itself and the ability to have allegiance to a religious organization from a region other than one’s own. It was a way to know about the many new seforim that were being published, republished, or newly discovered.</p>
<p>Yahrzeit allows one to imagine other times and places. On one hand, we have those who visiting the grave of the Lubavitcher Rebbe or engage in the Halakhic Man’s cognitive séance of the Rambam and Rabbenu Tam as each in their own way using the past for a presentist understanding. On the other hand, the antiquarian and those satisfied with the triviality of an obscure document lose the exemplarity. The spiritual path of Rabbi Simchah Bunim is more important than the novelty of his diploma from pharmacy school. </p>
<p>Which yahrzeits can appeal to us today? Those that can serve as a role model or broader horizons for our thoughts, our actions, or simply, our lives.  They each have different virtues but can give us insight into the religious life.  John Henry Newman wrote essays on the importance of saints in our lives as models of holiness. Not saints because they are officially recognized or because they have exalted angelic sanctity, but rather are people who help us aspire to holiness. They feed our imaginations, give us goals, and  show the many paths that one could take. Pascal observed how easily veneration can pass over into a pious trivialization of their challenge. We tend to regard the saints as &#8220;crowned with glory and years, judged almost divine before our time.&#8221; Gedolim, who are painted as divine preternatural children that grew up to have no knowledge of human life, do not inspire those looking for inspiration. In contrast, we need to see elements that showed how they faced the challenge of faith of their time and place and learn what it can teach us for our time. </p>
<p>“Traditional saints, precisely insofar as they responded to the demands of their own moment, remain a precious resource.” Ascetics, recluses, and gnostics were important in their time and still have much to teach us, today, however, they hold less interest for many of our needs. But what are the needs of the present moment? We need exemplarity for our narrative self, our psychological self, the self that needs both insights and to grapple with applications.  Unlike 19th century Galicia, we are not looking for miracles or heavenly interceders. </p>
<p>Back in my high school teaching days, my interest inspired one of the students to add selected dates to the student newspaper. Back then, I asked one of the Jewish publishers if they wanted a book of Zaddik days, (I had graduate school friends who were editing Catholic saint calendars and it was a popular doctoral topic in those years.) the publisher said: no, modern Jews are not interested in these things.</p>
<p>Is he still correct? Listening to news is important for our economic and political decisions, but we mark our days with infotainment news for the very sense of talking about new people each day.  If we cannot talk about ideas, then what if we discussed a rabbinic exemplar each day? What if aspiration matters more than creating controversies of the day? Picture a Jewish Exemplar Daily instead of Jewish ideology daily. What if we had one of those tear-sheet daily desk calendars with a description and quotes of Zaddik each day?  </p>
<p>Reb Simcha Bunim: “Just as a person must find for himself a teacher in this world, so too a person must find for himself a teacher in the next World.”<br />

				<p>Jews who follow interfaith are always asking: what are those Presbyterians saying today? Unlike Lutherans or Catholics in which there seems to be a clear course of reconciliation, Presbyterians are more hesitant, cautious, and less in common cause.<br />
In 1987, the Presbyterian Church in US issued <a href="http://www.pcjcr.org/theological%20understanding.pdf">&#8220;A Theological Understanding of the Relationship Between Christians and Jews.&#8221;</a> where following Catholics and the majority of mainline American Protestants they repudiated supersessionalism, antisemitism, and any condemnation of Judaism. But by 2004, Jews found <a href="http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ChJew_31/4537_31.htm">the Church&#8217;s views on Israel/Palestine not to their liking</a></p>
<p>The Canadian Church recently issued a statement that reiterated the 1987 statement as understood by recent documents and discussions. They also affirmed their recognition of Israel, prided themselves over the role which Presbyterian countries played in offering Jews religious freedom, yet it concluded by calling for mission to the Jews and messianic synagogues.</p>
<p>A Presbyterian minister married to a Reform Jewish academic <a href="http://kippahandcollar.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/on-canadian-presbyterians-and-the-jewish-people/">offers a full analysis as well as what he wished the document to have actually said. </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The proposed statement does very well in making explicit certain Presbyterian beliefs, such as that Christians and Jews worship the same God, that both Jews and Gentiles are included in one covenant of grace which God makes with humankind, and “that Jews have not been supplanted or replaced by Christians” (A&amp;P 2010, 355). The call for solidarity and dialogue and the common pursuit of peace and justice make extremely positive inclusions. The drafters of the statement have also made the important step of formally repudiating anti-Semitism while offering contrition for the church’s “complicity in the persecution, exclusion and expulsions of the Jews” (A&amp;P 2010, 356).</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some selections from the document:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Statement of The Presbyterian Church in Canada on our Relationship with the Jewish People</strong></p>
<p>In stating our relationship with the Jewish people we reaffirm a central tenet of our Reformed faith expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith, that there is one covenant of grace embracing Jews and Gentiles and therefore, not &#8220;two covenants of grace differing in substance, but one and the same under various dispensations&#8221; (VII, 6).</p>
<p>Accordingly, we affirm that the Jewish people have a unique role in God&#8217;s economy of salvation and healing for our world. Jesus himself taught that &#8220;salvation is from the Jews&#8221; (John 4:22) and the Apostle Paul stated: &#8220;to them belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, God who is over all be blessed forever. Amen&#8221; (Romans 9:4-5). The Jewish people have a pre-eminent place in God&#8217;s covenant, John Calvin finely said, for they are &#8220;the firstborn in God&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<p>We affirm that God has graciously included Gentile Christians, rightly called &#8220;posthumous children of Abraham&#8221; (J. Calvin), by engrafting them into the one people of God established by God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham. This means that Jews have not been supplanted and replaced by Christians in the one covenant. As Paul teaches, God has not rejected or abandoned them: &#8220;I ask, then has God rejected his people? By no means!&#8221; (Romans 11:1).</p>
<p>We believe that both Christians and Jews worship and serve the One Living God.</p>
<p>We confess God&#8217;s grace, mercy and faithfulness in the miracle of Jewish survival and the continuing existence and witness of the Jewish people. We are grateful that the State of Israel is a place the Jewish people can call home and we express our commitment as The Presbyterian Church in Canada to their right to live in peace, both in the Middle East and throughout the world. We also commit ourselves to pray for the peace of Jerusalem so all the children of Abraham may freely worship and live in a place they call holy.</p>
<p>It is always good for us to confess our sins to God. We acknowledge with shame and penitence the Church&#8217;s long complicity in the persecution, exclusion and expulsions of the Jews through the &#8220;teaching of contempt&#8221;, beginning in the first centuries of the Christian era, gathering strength during the Crusades and culminating in the Shoah or Holocaust. As Christians we have failed to demonstrate to the Jewish community and to individual Jews that love which Jesus Christ commanded us to show. Of this lack of love and teaching of contempt and the attitudes and acts which proceeded from it, we humbly repent.</p>
<p>It is also, however, a matter of historical record that countries in which the Reformed tradition and its &#8220;one covenant of grace&#8221; theology took root have provided refuge for this persecuted people. The Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community has lived in the Netherlands (and Dutch colonies like Curacao) with full citizenship rights since the 17th century. There were no pogroms in Scotland. During the Puritan Commonwealth Jews were re-admitted to England and have flourished as a community both there and in what became the United States. We are thankful for Christians, of all traditions throughout the ages, who have stood in solidarity with Jews. We call upon our people to eschew the use of language and innuendo which may disparage, slander and harm Jews and we urge Christians to show solidarity with Jews when acts of hatred, such as the desecration of graves, synagogues and schools are perpetrated against them.</p>
<p>Both Christians and Jews look forward in hope to God&#8217;s full redemption which Christians believe will occur in the Second Advent when Jesus Christ returns, a hope which includes the Jews, for as Paul teaches in Romans 9-11, in Jesus Christ there will be an ingathering of people, whether of Jewish or Gentile background: &#8220;so all Israel will be saved&#8221; (Romans 11:26). The Presbyterian Church in Canada has sought to serve Jewish people in Canada in the name of our Lord through specific mission efforts in Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg. The most well known of those was the Christian Synagogue in Toronto which evolved into the Scott Mission. Finally we encourage our congregations and people to take the initiative and to reach out in friendship and hospitality to neighboring synagogues and Jewish people and where they can, to engage in Jewish Christian dialogue to promote better mutual understanding and to pursue and ensure the establishment of peace and justice and the good and betterment of the wider community.

				<p>Last years&#8217; announcement of the attempt to create a trilateral seminary that produced ministers, rabbis, and imams has come to be. They plan on working to include Jains also. I do not know how it would work and I have heard that there is a bot of controversy among some of the potential poll of instructors. There are severla similar projects int he works around the US. The Jewish leader of this project Mel Gottlieb is a RIETS musmakh who is the President of the Academy for Jewish Religion, California (AJRCA). Here is an article he just wrote about introducing hevruta study for three faith purposes.</p>
<blockquote><p>In June of 2010, the three of us, Rev. Jerry Campbell, Imam Jihad Turk and Rabbi Mel Gottlieb, announced an agreement for our respective institutions to co-create the world&#8217;s first inter-religious university &#8212; a place where rabbis, ministers, imams and other religious leaders would each be educated in their own traditions, side by side, but also with classes in common. The new university would include academic schools for students who wanted to do world-healing work in non-religious fields as well. </p>
<p>The purpose of this new concept was not to water down the beliefs of each of the different traditions, but rather to create understanding, promote mutual respect and learn how to cooperate across religious boundaries to address the world&#8217;s greatest problems.</p>
<p>This Sept. 6, 2011, with the help of a $50 million gift from Joan and David Lincoln, our vision is becoming a reality in the form of the launch of Claremont Lincoln University. We are very excited about the history-making potential of this new institution and the caliber of students it is attracting.</p>
<p>About a year ago we committed to meet for chavruta once a month. Chavruta is Hebrew for an engagement to study holy texts. When it&#8217;s done between people of different beliefs, it&#8217;s a way of getting to know &#8220;the other,&#8221; rather than accepting stereotypes.</p>
<p>At our most recent meeting, we chose texts that were troublesome from our own scriptures. We explained them to each other in light of scholarship, historical context and spiritual insight. We&#8217;ve discovered that the more fundamentalist members of each of our faiths prefer literal interpretations of such texts, often without considering scholarship and context, and use them to create separation rather than inclusion. We disagree with that approach.</p>
<p>For this session, Imam Turk chose a text from the Quran that is often interpreted as meaning that those who don&#8217;t believe in Islam cannot obtain salvation.He pointed out, however, that capitalizing the word Islam in this case is a fundamentalist translation. It implies that those who believe the religion of Islam are superior. Other texts in the Quran (such as 2:62) contradict that assumption. </p>
<p>In fact, said Imam Turk, the correct scholarly translation of this text is to spell islam with a lower case &#8220;i,&#8221; using the word&#8217;s literal meaning: submission/yielding (to God). Since Christians, Jews and other spiritual people, as well as Muslims, yield to the Divine, they are all included in the word islam.</p>
<p>Our chavruta, and many such similar groups around the world, prove that people from very different religious traditions can respect, understand and love each other &#8212; and hopefully spread that spirit to their communities.<br />
It is not surprising that leaders from countries with high levels of religious violence are among the most enthusiastic voices of praise for this new model for desegregating religious education. If we can make this concept work here in America, there is hope that similar models will work in their countries as well. May it be so.<br />
