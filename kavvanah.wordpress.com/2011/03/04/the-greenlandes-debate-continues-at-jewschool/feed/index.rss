Hi lipchitz,

I&#039;m sorry you feel that way. Perhaps after you take a look at these three representative pieces (brief, not to worry), you&#039;ll reconsider the claim about neo-conservative orthodoxies:

Needing Jeremiah: http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/module/2010/11/10/main-feature/1/needing-jeremiah

The Spirit of the Margin: http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/detail/continue-reading-the-spirit-of-the-margin

The Mood of the Oud:

I&#039;m sorry, Aryeh, but I find none of this fair or very &quot;mature,&quot; like so many of the negative critiques that appear in Jewish Ideas Daily and in the Jewish Review of Books. Instead of substantive disagreement, we get a lot of ad-hominem invective, name-calling, sniping and snide innuendo about Jewish Renewal, or Independent Minyanim, or Arthur Green, or Liberalism, or secular forms of Judaism, or J Street. Sadly, the talkbacks that appear on Jewish Ideas Daily are only not-much-worse than the articles themselves. It&#039;s hardly surprising that the replies of people like Green or Waskow, who have commited themselves over the long haul to the Jewish people and to Judaism, lend themselves to such a mix of disdain and rage.

As for &quot;clarity,&quot; Aryeh, I simply cannot take at face value your assurance that there are no hidden neoconservative orthodoxies dictating editorial policy at Jewsih Ideas Daily (or for that matter at the Jewish Review of Books);  certainly not if Neal Kozodoy, the old editor in chief from Commentary, is running things on staff at JID as you suggest or at JRB as others have suggested.  Of course, there&#039;s no mention of him on the masthead at either organization. But why then would Tikvah Fund have hired him if not to edit and control precisely these venues along a rightwing slant?

Please understand that there are many people out there who are very upset by this uncivil tone and lack of transparency. These do not seem to be secure foundations for the robust form of Jewish community that all of us want to foster.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope that in raising the following question(s) I am not diverting too far afield from the Green-Landes debate. Both use theological language and  Jewish religious concepts, although their usages differ radically, whereas my questions do not do so.

I do not have any answers to the questions which I raise, which would probably best be addressed by sociologists.  But I am sure that others might have something to say about this as well.

1. Can there be viable Jewish communities of agnostics and/or atheists in 21st century US (Israel may be a very differenct situation)? By this I mean a community that is explicit about its lack of theological belief, and yet feels bonded to other Jews, and creates local communities and institutions which reinforce these bonds and which act not only as an aggregate of individuals, but also as a communities with shared values, aspirations and behaviors.

I suppose that secular / humanist Jewish communities (of which there are some may be attempts at this. I don&#039;t know much about them, but wonder how successful they are (whatever that would mean, since &#039;success&#039; would have to be defined both  in their terms, and in the terms of those  who do not accept their views. 

(Could there be any shared criteria of &#039;success&#039; between atheists/agnostics and theological Jews)?
 
2.Or do non-theological Jews not need communities? 

3. Or perhaps they satisfy their communal needs (albeit not in the same way that orthodox communities do so, with Shabbat and many other holidays and rituals) by being involved in certain Jewish organizations, such AJC, Jewish social justice organizations, academic Jewish Studies, Mazon, and many such others.
 
In the late 19th and first half of the 20th century there were many such non-theological communities, such as the Bundists, and of course secular Zionists. But the ideologies  that sustained and motivated these non-theological, Jewish ethnically based communites/organizations have waned or are waning. Can there be viable substitutes for them?

					<description><![CDATA[Continued…

First, I should clarify: interest in reviving the Jewish tradition often translates into the revival of the Jewish people, as well. Which perhaps puts the interest in HaShomer HaZair (mine, as well as Rav Kook&#039;s) in perspective – they explicitly set themselves up as a movement for the revival of the Jewish people, and were understood as such in their original context. 

As for the pattern of negative reviews, while the critiques differ – for instance, Landes attacks a non-personal God, but as a student of the Rambam, not to mention the mystical tradition, I don&#039;t see a non-personal God as a problem – I think the common denominator is that all the pieces critique Jewish Renewal, Indie minyanim, etc., for their lack of clarity as well as an immature sense of communal responsibility. Those values – clarity and a mature sense of communal responsibility - inform the perspectives of the Jewish Review of Books and Jewish Ideas Daily, so perhaps the pattern shouldn&#039;t be that surprising.

As for talking past each other, if you look at my attempted talkback with R&#039; Arthur Waskow I think you&#039;ll see that I&#039;m more than willing to engage in dialogue. For Waskow, however, I, and those like me, are a-priori disqualified as interlocutors because we question whether the historical process that he considers to be progress and that issues in Jewish Renewal, is, in fact, progress. 

And this I think helps answer your question as to why defenders of Jewish Renewal argue so emotionally. One of the reasons you don&#039;t get intellectual responses is the same reason that you didn&#039;t get intellectual responses from Marxists or that you don&#039;t get intellectual responses from present-day messianists – from the perspective of &#039;hard-core&#039; progressives, one only opposes what is clearly true out of willful blindness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not renewal in any institutional sense - a rather contradictory notion in any case. However, to cite one example, my reading of and interest in the Zohar is deeply influenced by Melila Hellner-Eshed&#039;s &quot;A River Flows From Eden,&quot;  as well as Y. Liebes&#039; work in general. I find the notion of zohar=universal eros to be compelling, and it is in tune with certain notions emerging from the Renewal Movement regarding the &#039;meaning&#039; of Divinity. 

I agree of course that HaShomer HaZair and Sephardi piyyut aren&#039;t usually associated with Jewish Renewal - although here in Israel there is a certain degree of overlap between &#039;renewal&#039; and piyyut. The common denominator is my interest in 20th and 21st century responses to the stagnation of the Jewish tradition. If I can lean on a monumental figure for support, I think Rav Kook&#039;s highly-developed receptivity  was informed by his search for revitalization, wherever it happens to show up. 

I&#039;ll try to answer the last two questions after I give them some additional thought.]]></description>

Aryeh,
Thanks for the post. 
I have a number of questions:
In what way are you renewal and what sources and people are you turning to? To turn to Shomer Tzayyir and piyyut, does not seem to be what people call renewal. 
How do you account for this seeming pattern of negative reviews that you say is not a pattern? Quite a few people out there see it as a pattern.
Why do you think both sides are talking past each other?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Alan,
I recently wrote &quot;Spirituality Lite&quot; at Jewish Ideas Daily, one of the articles which you refer  to above on Jewish Renewal. Since you don&#039;t know me, a brief introduction. I wrote my thesis at Hebrew University, &quot;Theories of Progress in Leo Strauss&#039; Later Writings on Maimonides,&quot; under the direction of Zev Harvey. It was approved in 2010. I also studied for a number of years at various Jerusalem yeshivot, from Lithuanian Haredi to Beit Morasha, and presently I teach at the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, although my practice isn&#039;t Conservative. I am in a certain sense post-denominational. Which brings me to my first of two points. 
1) I did not present the issue - or at least I didn&#039;t intend to present the issue - as an either/or.  I am in deep sympathy with certain dimensions of post-denominational Judaism precisely because revitalizing the tradition is far more important than defining it, which is what usually happens within institutional frameworks. This is, I should add, a theme which I have treated on a number of occassions at Jewish Ideas Daily, for instance when writing on the revivial of Sephardi piyyut: http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/detail/continue-reading-the-sephardi-turn
as all as the &quot;fusion&quot; of Jazz and piyyut: http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/module/2010/6/17/main-feature/1/come-swing-with-me
In addition, my next piece presents HaShomer HaTzair as, originally, a movement for Jewish Renewal. 
2) To set the record straight, there is absolutely no editorial policy at Jewish Ideas Daily when it comes to these issues. I wanted to write on &quot;Jewish Mysticism and the Spiritual Life&quot; because of my interest in Jewish Renewal in the broadest sense, and I had to persuade Neal Kozodoy to let me run with it.  
I would be happy to be continue the conversation.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Alan,<br />
I recently wrote &#8220;Spirituality Lite&#8221; at Jewish Ideas Daily, one of the articles which you refer  to above on Jewish Renewal. Since you don&#8217;t know me, a brief introduction. I wrote my thesis at Hebrew University, &#8220;Theories of Progress in Leo Strauss&#8217; Later Writings on Maimonides,&#8221; under the direction of Zev Harvey. It was approved in 2010. I also studied for a number of years at various Jerusalem yeshivot, from Lithuanian Haredi to Beit Morasha, and presently I teach at the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, although my practice isn&#8217;t Conservative. I am in a certain sense post-denominational. Which brings me to my first of two points.<br />

					<description><![CDATA[Re: the either/or line re: religion/secularism at Jewish Review of Books and Jewish Ideas Daily: Hillel Halkin is NOT the editorial instigator .

The connecting, instigating, controlling link is the Tivkah Fund [and Neal Kozodoy (who used to run Commentary)]. 

The Tikvah Fund is a very wealthy, rightwing philanthropy with deep corporate pockects and neoconservative roots. 

It runs the &quot;Jewish Review of Books&quot; and &quot;Jewish Ideas Daily,&quot; as well as academic and semi-academic institutes at Princeton, NYU, Oxford, JTS, and Toronto. Tablet and Nextbook are also connected.

You&#039;ll see the exact same pattern over and over again.

They are, to my mind, a nasty bunch. For some reason, Michael Walzer is providing them cover. Maybe because of Princeton, but nobody knows why.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[R. Zalman Schacter once said “As we grow up we all get on a bus. Some get off close to home, some go a little further, some even go pretty far away. I never got off the bus.”  Sounds about right to me. R. Landes seems  to be someone who has left the neighborhood of his childhood, and if you accept the importance  of small differences has stretched considerably from his initial upbringing. But from what I see, he has a mindset where Orthodoxy, both Charedi and Modern are looking over his shoulder. There are limits where he won’t go, and is agitated by others who have no such constraints. With R. Arthur Green it’s different;  he got on the bus in a secular neighborhood, a place which for many looks like close to the end of the line. But unlike Zalman’s linear bus, and R. Landes staying within the Orthodox orbit, the trajectory of Arthur Green was always something of a zig-zag. Back to JTS, forward with the chavurah and Jewish Renewal movements, back to the world of scholarship, forward to the Reconstructionist seminary. The place his trajectory never visited was Orthodoxy. As a result he has no feel for living Chasidim, and finds many of their ways repugnant. His Chasidim are all dead, known primarily through their books. He owes Orthodoxy nothing, he doesn’t care much what Orthodox Jews think, and most importantly he is not addressing those who look to Orthodoxy as an essential starting point for their Judaism. 

His constituency as well as Zalman’s are the two-three million Jews here in America who belong to no denomination, many of whom are intermarried and have no historical connection with the European Jewish past. Part of Arthur Green’s continued surprise at the Landes criticism is that he is being given no credit for attempting to keep the outer rings of American Jewry connected to its origins, when they have no memories or experience of Jewish life. If his teaching is to be credible he must include a universalist element.What is he supposed to teach…that the intermarried are an erav rav, their geirus is worthless as is their patrilineal descent? There goes his demographic. How would you connect with people for whom the entire social, familial element is missing? His answer, and he may be right, is to go inward and join forces with the spiritual but not religious side of American Jewry.]]></description>
