					<description><![CDATA[Just three weeks ago I heard Idel talk about the problem of researching religion today (that is, researching contemporary religion) with yesterday&#039;s (philology) tools. He called for some interdisciplinary work with sociology, as the field is in a constant flux and reading books is just not enough. As a phd student who loves to read and researches Jewish Renewal et al, this of course was quite depressing to hear.

And thank you for your kind words in that other post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/the-editors-of-the-jewish-mystical-tradition-respond-to-the-jid-review/#comment-2888&quot;&gt;Yehoshua Hershberg&lt;/a&gt;.

From Tepper&#039;s response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;One of the ultimate concerns of [the Jewish] tradition is to
actualize the image of God latent in human beings—women and men, Jews
and non-Jews alike. And one of the ways the tradition does this is by
constantly putting before us the commanding heights of perfection by
which we should strive to evaluate and order our own lives. If, in the
light of those heights, I know that mine is a &quot;low&quot; life, at least I
know where I stand—and also that, if I so will it, and if I put in the
effort, I can rise upward.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This makes sense as a description of mussar. But is mussar really
coterminus with tradition, or with the way non new-age Judaisms conduct
themselves?]]></description>

Neochasidus at JTS? Try neoconservatism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JTS ADVANCES REFLECTION ON CRUCIAL EXISTENTIAL ISSUES: God. Morality. War. Good. Evil. These are just some of the topics addressed by our new Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought, directed by Dr. Alan Mittleman, professor of Jewish Philosophy at JTS. Needless to say, these are not minor conversations; they deal with the big issues of life. The Tikvah Institute organizes conferences, promotes events, and cooperates with existing Tikvah projects at Princeton University, NYU Law School, and the University of Toronto. In October, the institute began a series of free public lectures called Contemporary Jewish Philosophy: Three Lectures, and in March it will launch a series of rabbinic seminars, featuring speakers such as William Kristol of The Weekly Standard and Professor Moshe Halbertal of Hebrew University and New York University, that will focus on some of the broad moral themes mentioned above.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found your review and this post to be clear and to the point. 

My impression from reading what’s on the internet is that there are two groups involved in this new spiritualism.  There are the Jewish Renewal people, reconstructionist in spirit, not worried about halacha, joyfully syncretistic and pitching to the unaffiliated marginal Jews, the intermarried and  secular. Many of these potential congregants  when asked their religion, in lieu of saying Jewish, describe themselves as “born Jewish, now  spiritual but not religious.” Then there are more traditional Jewish thinkers centered around Conservadox who feel that the only way to light a fire in the space left of Centrist Orthodoxy up to Reform is with Chasidus. 

Their claim in both instances, forgetting for the moment the basis of their authority,  is that they possess the techne, the tools to reignite the Jewish spirit.  The test is in the doing, promissory notes and programmatic statements won’t do. If any version actually worked, who cares if they had the proper authority? In creating a large vibrant community they create their own authority. So far I see only two success stories…Reb Shlomo Carlebach who was no theologian, very traditional in his talk, but highly charismatic and passionate in his music. Nigunim that come from the heart can reach deep places in the Jewish neshama, and most everyone who opened themselves to his negina benefitted. The other is Reb Zalman, who after all is said and done did manage to clone his derech, along the way ordaining rabbis, creating new styles of worship…the whole nine yards. I don’t see many in my neck of the woods chalishing for his tuition, but as these things are measured he is a success. The big test is in the future… will neo chasidus revitalize the Conservative movement? Who will step forward and graduate from philologist to Conservative rebbe? All us kibitzers in the bleachers are anxiously awaiting the answer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I&#039;d add to Alan&#039;s find discussion of the philology/spirituality distinction is that recognizing  the difference allows one to then ask under what conditions and by what kind of authority can one then cross that line? Or do we have to guard or even police that line to preserve some imaginary core of Jewish tradition which is forever in danger of dissolution, but which in fact seems always to reconstitute itself precisely on the line between learning and innovation?

As Max Weber might have recognized, today that authority is charismatic, not traditional  or bureaucratic. I think Aryeh would like to assert a monopoly for tradition, but I fear that the automatic and systematic tarring of anything relating to Renewal suggests that more  bureaucratic models of institutional thought-control are at work over at JID and the Jewish Review of Books. (We&#039;re talking about the multimillion dollar, corporate, neoconservative Tikvah Fund again, right?)

Like jazz, you know charisma when you see or hear it. Maybe not so much when you read it. I for one might have 101 problems with the book under review or with Green&#039;s Radical Judaism. But I&#039;ve seen Green teach before a synagogue group, many of whose members might have twice as many criticisms about the book as  I do. And he has them for at least the moment. Because he&#039;s the real deal and because people respect quiet wisdom and devotional depth that come with many years of deep thought, and we actually learn something in the process despite or in our disagreements.

I for one trust Green to &quot;cross&quot; that line between philology and spirituality. He&#039;s earned that right and that trust. I&#039;d say the same about Fine, Fishbane, Rose and many of the contributors to this volume. In contrast, I&#039;m pretty sure I don&#039;t trust attempts by Aryeh, Landes, JID, or the Jewish Review of Books to guard that line; the ideological line is so insistent all the time about everything. Because they cry &quot;wolf&quot; all the time, I&#039;m not sure they are able to distinguish genuine from ersatz tradition and spirituality (or is it Chicken Little?).

Perhaps a comment regarding graphics is in order. Maybe we should retire the back-slash in favor of a hyphen. A (-) would seem a more giving symbol than (/). It preserves the difference its user seeks to cross, while knowing that the difference remains different.]]></description>
