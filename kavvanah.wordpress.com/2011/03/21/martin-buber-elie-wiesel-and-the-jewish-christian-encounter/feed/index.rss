					<description><![CDATA[I love Martin Buber. I&#039;ve read almost everything by Him.  Also, much by Maurice Friedman concerning him.   However, Martin was totally wrong about Paul when he claimed  Paul’s version of faith is pistis: a more intellectual belief in the cognitive truth of something.  This was definitely not Paul&#039;s idea.  It is the idea of gentiles who have turned their backs on the real message of  Paul, because it is too difficult for them to bear.   It is simply the way gentiles worship.  They have (and want) no organic connection to Who or what they worship.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan: I&#039;ll do some checking in the McGill library and try to track down the symposium I referred to. 

IIRC, David Berger responded to Greenberg&#039;s point by saying, &quot;And what if one asks the Messiah: Are you the incarnation of the second person of the Trinity?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Larry, 
It fits perfectly with Yitz Greenberg, who views were created in symbiosis with Wiesel. But it is not Buber who had firm beliefs in the immediacy of the present moment- no waiting for an escaton and saw the two faiths as different.
According to the google search, it does seem to be from Yitz Greenberg. But did Wiesel add the last line &quot;please do not answer&quot; and the false attribution to Buber? 
1973 is about right. 1963 would be theologically anachronistic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan: If you google Irving Greenberg  + second or future  coming of the messiah, you will see that he already presented   the &quot;no comment&quot;  idea in a speech he gave at Sacred Heart University in 1973! I am almost certain  I remember  him mentioning this idea earlier in  a symposium in Judaism magazine.  IIRC, David Berger refers to Greenberg&#039;s view  in his review of his  book in Tradition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am almost certain that I heard this story  in the 60s, and that it was not connected wth Buber. But let me do some checking. Perhaps the attribution to Buber is Wiesel&#039;s own special contribution.]]></description>
