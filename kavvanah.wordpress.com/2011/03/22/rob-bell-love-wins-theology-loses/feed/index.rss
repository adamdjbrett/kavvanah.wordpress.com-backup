					<description><![CDATA[Which Afterlife?

In his new book &quot;Love Wins&quot; Rob Bell seems to say that loving and compassionate people, regardless of their faith, will not be condemned to eternal hell just because they do not accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. 

Concepts of an afterlife vary between religions and among divisions of each faith. Here are three quotes from &quot;the greatest achievement in life,&quot; my ebook on comparative mysticism:

(46) Few people have been so good that they have earned eternal paradise; fewer want to go to a place where they must receive punishments for their sins. Those who do believe in resurrection of their body hope that it will be not be in its final form. Few people really want to continue to be born again and live more human lives; fewer want to be reborn in a non-human form. If you are not quite certain you want to seek divine union, consider the alternatives.

(59) Mysticism is the great quest for the ultimate ground of existence, the absolute nature of being itself. True mystics transcend apparent manifestations of the theatrical production called “this life.” Theirs is not simply a search for meaning, but discovery of what is, i.e. the Real underlying the seeming realities. Their objective is not heaven, gardens, paradise, or other celestial places. It is not being where the divine lives, but to be what the divine essence is here and now.

(80) [referring to many non-mystics] Depending on their religious convictions, or personal beliefs, they may be born again to seek elusive perfection, go to a purgatory to work out their sins or, perhaps, pass on into oblivion. Lives are different; why not afterlives? Beliefs might become true.

Rob Bell asks us to reexamine the Christian Gospel. People of all faiths should look beyond the letter of their sacred scriptures to their spiritual message. As one of my mentors wrote &quot;In God we all meet.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering what &#039;evangelical&#039; is taken to mean in this context. It seems to have become a term ripe for equivocation. Is it now, as Dr. Brill suggests, simply a cultural identifier?

Also worth thinking about is what &#039;heaven&#039; is doing so prominently in the discussion. For some people heaven just is the place where people who accept Jesus get tot hang out and bask in the eternal love. For others, heaven seems to signify that your life was acceptable to god by some moral standard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bashir is one tough interviewer, and Bell very gracefully took all the fast paced attacks. At the end, however, we are no closer to understanding either Bell&#039;s views or his opposition&#039;s, since Bashir seems hopelessly stuck in a certain mindset that is overly simplistically binary. Many either or questions, when the answer is or should be subtle.

That said, I think that Bell took the Christian doctrine of unconditional love to its absurd logical extent, which is that if ultimately his god loves all regardless of their beliefs and actions, why be moral, ethical and pious, IOW why adhere to the religion? (This question, by the way, also emerges from taking Prof. Yeshayahu Leibowitz to his logical absurd extreme. A couple of years ago Tradition published a nice article on this.)

More orthodox Christians will probably and sensibly qualify their understanding of the Christian doctrine of Agape, but the real culprit here is probably an unbridled agape doctrine, not Bell per se.

Separately, several of Bashir&#039;s questions are Jewishly relevant, too, and there are well established answers to many of those questions (example: even if everyone goes to heaven, cf. yesh qone &#039;olamo besha&#039;a a&#039;hat, even so, one&#039;s extent of heaven may still be function of one&#039;s values in life, and heaven and hell don&#039;t cancel each other out, rather, they are for most subsequent experiences; answers that are ethically compelling and sufficiently universalist). I am surprized none such kind of answers were mentioned, which does strengthen at least one of Bashir&#039;s accusations, namely, that Bell has created a theology for the theologically lazy, looking-after-warm-fuzzy-spirituality Facebook generation. It is namely theologically demanding to become subtle enough to understand these answers; perhaps they don&#039;t fit on the Facebook &quot;wall.&quot;]]></description>
