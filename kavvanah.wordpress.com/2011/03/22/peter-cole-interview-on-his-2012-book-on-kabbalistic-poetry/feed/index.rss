					<description><![CDATA[&quot;God in this scheme constructs through language, which is to say that the cosmos is a literary creation.&quot;

Unless I am really bad reader of things, this is a terrible misrepresentation of SY. If anything it seems to see the deconstruction of language into elemental combination that lack the required semiosis of human language as a distinctly divine creative  process. 

But perhaps there are simply too many different ways to read SY and this is but one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Amit. You are right, of course. I saw Cole do a reading of these poem translations a few months ago. He introduced them by admitting that he was using &quot;Kabbalah&quot; loosely to refer to Jewish Mysticism. The question of Yannai&#039;s status as a mystic (whatever the heck that means) is irrelevant to the literary question that takes preference for Cole. (Though I do recall him mentioning something about how he gives preference to the liturgical performative as a locus for mystical locution.) 
Which indeed leads to a more interesting question of what constitutes mystical poetic discourse. 
In a personal conversation following his talk I asked him why there was no Zohar in the book. He said that while he agrees that parts of the Zohar are poetic no one has been able to show him a &quot;poem&quot; therein. I wonder whether &quot;k&#039;gavnah&quot; can be taken as a poem. My sense is that it was written as a sort of piyut, in which case its certainly as much as &quot;mystical poem&quot; as anything Yannai ever wrote.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some small corrections: (1) Yannai was not a Kabbalist. In fact, we don&#039;t even know if he was a mystic. Probably not. Kabbala was invented many many years after him. (2) Sepher Yetzira is not a Kabbalistic work either.]]></description>
