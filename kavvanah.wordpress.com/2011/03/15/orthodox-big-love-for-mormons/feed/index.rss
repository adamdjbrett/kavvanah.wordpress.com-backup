					<description><![CDATA[How gratifying to hear that there are friendships being forged, discussions taking place.   Mormons who are deep into their faith tend to have a great deal of respect and feel a kinship with the Jewish faith, traditions, teachings, and practices.   We embrace truth where it is found, and in our eyes, there is no room for anything but admiration and respect for the truth of Judaism.   We may have &quot;our take&quot; on things of course, but in the way of family, heritage, and core values and beliefs,  we have much to share together and celebrate together.   Love and respect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/orthodox-big-love-for-mormons/#comment-2907&quot;&gt;M.Efron&lt;/a&gt;.

M.  There are a few points of LDS doctrine, in which you are misinformed.  We don&#039;t believe that JHWH is a subgod.  He is a member of the Godhead.  Do you believe that other religions consider JHWH a subgod because he is a member of their trinity?  Elohim or God the Father is also a member of that Godhead, but is not the godhead.  The Godhead is composed of G-D the Father, his son JHWH, and the Holy Ghost....similar to the trinity, but also different.  But in no way do we consider JHWH to be a subgod.  We also don&#039;t believe that &quot;all human beings have been gods before being born and will be again&quot;.  We believe that all humans existed before this life, but we were not gods, we were spirit children of our heavenly father (Elohim).  We also don&#039;t believe that all humans will become gods.  We believe that this life is a chance for us to become like G-d.  And that if we obey his commandments, through the atonement of Christ, can become like our Heavenly Father.  Not too difficult or outrageous of a claim, doesn&#039;t every parent seek for their children to have all that they have?  Doesn&#039;t every parent want their children to be like them (well the good characteristics :-) ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mormons are polytheistic  religion and believe that JHWH is a subgod to a Godhead called Elohim. Elohim has his residence  near an unknown  star called Kolob.
Elohim has a wife, too. All human beings have been gods before being born and will be again. Mormons also say that the Hebrew Bible verifies all this.

Has the fact that there is only one God, not myriads, any importance to Judaism ? One can choose friends among football fans or swimmers without much thought to their beliefs, but talking about relations between religions, it would be well to remember what one stands for. Otherwise it might even make ignorant people think that as religion Judaism and Mormonism are like, even though they differ like day and night.]]></description>

Mark,
Thank you for the correction. Is there anything that you wish to add about how you see the Orthodox community having an affinity to cordiality with yourself and your fellow Mormons?
How would you characterize the current state of the encounter between the groups?]]></description>

Jon - Unfortunately, you have no idea what you&#039;re talking about re replacement theology and Mormons. Here&#039;s my blog post on the topic:
http://www.jewishjournal.com/jews_and_mormons/item/replacement_theology_mormons_and_the_amish_39101204/
Also, your priesthood terminology is off, and our faith is not based on Masonic rituals. One of the main temple rituals involves the washing and anointing ritual administered to Aaron and his priests, which is explained in Exodus. Just curious: would you like a Mormon to poke fun at the tallit katan on a website? I&#039;m very disappointed to see such profound ignorance on display on a Jewish website, even if it is only a silly comment. As the saying goes, a little learning is a dangerous thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To amplify Mordechai&#039;s point: Do these OU rabbis know that the Mormons hold to a strong replacement theology?

I had been informed by email about the strange Mormon statement since I was not there. I just checked out the details on the video. The person who said it was Rabbi Steven Burg Managing Director, Orthodox Union. It is at 83:30 on the video and explained in the next 2 minutes.

The idea that the OU wants more to do with the Mormon Church and is trying to develop Jewish mission is so strange. 
Weil&#039;s line about integrating ideas from other faiths is fine, but did he elaborate upon the reason for wanting to incorporate mission? 
ould you elaborate upon what it is Weil admires about mission and why it should be integrated into Orthodox Judaism?
As you pointed out - the mission model is not Torah Tours. 
Do you think he meant that he wants an Orthodox yearlong camp Ramah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the lovefest speaks to the discomfort with mainstream Evangelicals felt even by evangelical, family values Orthodox Jews.

Mormons arenâ€™t trying to make America a Mormon country whereas many Evangelical streams have a strong anti-pluralist, monocultural Christian agenda for America. (Itâ€™s telling that itâ€™s the most Zionist of Modern Orthodox rabbis â€” Riskin â€” who is making the deepest connections with the evangelicals.)

Ultimately, the bond of minority status is more important than non-corporeal theology. (Though I would think that Michael Wyschogrod might be able to find a profitable theological niche to exploit here.)]]></description>
