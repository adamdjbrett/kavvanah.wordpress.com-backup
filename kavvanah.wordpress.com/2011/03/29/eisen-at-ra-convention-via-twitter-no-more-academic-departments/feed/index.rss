					<description><![CDATA[The abolition of departments is well on the trajectory of changing JTS to a Rabbinical school with a graduate faculty from its previous life as a graduate school which created Rabbis as a byproduct.  The first step (early in the Eisen tenure) was to permit the Rab school to write its own curriculum (!).  I think that JTS under Eisen correctly sees its institutional competition as Hebrew College, RRC etc., rather than university Jewish studies (an arena in which it doesn&#039;t have the resources to dominate, to say the least).]]></description>
