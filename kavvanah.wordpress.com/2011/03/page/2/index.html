				<p>Two weeks ago, a local rabbi gave a speech against Charter schools because they will change the character and nature of the community. I wonder what social change he envisions and is scared about? Greater knowledge of arts and sciences? Less provincialism? Less sports watching and pop culture? It is not like anything that goes on in the Reform and Conservative congregation has any effect on his vision of the community so why should this change it? This week the Jewish Week got involved and had a long article on parents transferring their kids to public school and I hear it has led to an avalanche response of other parents seeking info about transferring. </p>
<p>A year ago I posted about some of the similarities of the Jewish and Catholic examples,<a href="../../../../2010/01/11/catholic-schools-and-jewish-day-schools/index.html">here</a> and <a href="../../../../2010/09/13/archbishop-timothy-dolan-on-catholic-schools-jewish-parallels/index.html">here.</a> So I was not going to post my new links, but someone told me that there were new points in this article. First, Baltimore Catholic schools are fighting charter schools and see it as a battle of charter schools against parochial schools. The Baltimore Archdiocese seeing chapter schools as killing Catholic schools. To this, the general Baltimore newspaper claimed that the Archdiocese should not respond in fear and defensive, rather it should emphasize what it does best teach faith. There is a message for Jews to also respond from strength and not fear of the corruption of the neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="../../../../2020/05/10/blogging-again-book-sale/index.html">Charter schools called threat to Catholic schools</a><br />
The Archdiocese of Baltimore has refused to sell or lease vacant school buildings to charter schools because it has found that charter schools are siphoning students away from Catholic schools, according to the Baltimore Sun.<br />
My own diocese, Brooklyn, is very active in leasing properties to charter schools – encouraged by Mayor Bloomberg, a big supporter of charter schools.</p>
<p>The foundation and government officials who are pushing charter schools – the Gates Foundation, the Obama administration, and others – have an obligation to face up to the fact that they are contributing to the demise of Catholic schools.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now the response:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/2011/03/post_161.html">Archdiocese shouldn&#8217;t block charters</a><br />
But the archdiocese’s reluctance to lease its now-shuttered school buildings to charter schools belies that spirit. It speaks to an intuition huddled in a defensive crouch, not one that believes it has something unique and important to offer. If the system views increasing competition from quality public schools as something to fear, it is in a losing position.</p>
<p>The archdiocese’s desire to avoid helping the competition is understandable but ultimately misguided. If the only thing Catholic schools have to offer is that they’re an alternative to low-quality neighborhood schools, the system is putting itself in a position of rooting against the rapid improvement in Baltimore’s public school system and against the flourishing of educational choice through the charter movement.<br />
 If the Catholic schools are going to survive, they need to convince parents that they get something for their tuition that they can’t at a public school, even an excellent one.</p>
<p>What that is should be obvious. The archdiocese conducted focus groups before last year’s school closure and found that the religious component of the education its schools offer and the atmosphere of faith are a chief draw,<br />
That is the one thing no charter school can offer, and there are still many parents in this city, </p></blockquote>

				<p>I received a video of a former YU student teaching a class in Judaism in an after school program that teaches both Judaism and Christianity.  The program describes itself as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Interfaith Community’s bi-religious curriculum, simultaneously taught by a Christian educator and a Jewish one&#8230;In 2010, a two-year class for teenagers was launched in the Westchester and Orange/Rockland chapters that caters to children from 12 to 14 years old. It helps them grapple with identity questions specific to that age, regarding who they are and who they want to become. The program educators, however, stress that no decision needs to be made, that identity is something that builds over time and that it can change at any time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure what to make of it. The program started at Trinity day school (Upper West Side) that has at least half of its students with at least one Jewish parent. This class was in Rockland. In general, the word among sociologists of the Jewish community is that zip code is destiny. In Bergen or Brooklyn counties, most Jews marry other Jews and when they intermarry the likelihood is that the kids will consider themselves Jewish. It is actually upwardly mobile for many Christians to marry Jews here in NJ and gain Jewish family life. On the other hand, traditional Jews in the certain parts of the south or west will intermarry and not raise their kids as Jewish. So I can have sympathy for this here in the East coast where even a secular Jew who intermarried and sent his or her kids to Trinity, will likely produce Jews. But what of Portland? Sante Fe? Watch the video.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/21238319" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Judaism and Christianity are not seen as opposites anymore. I know people who kasher their kitchen for Passover and also celebrate Easter. It is a world of multiple identities—racial, religious, ethnic. Nothing contradicts. Even Hebrew schools which officially can’t welcome interfaith children because of Halakha (Jewish law), have started applying a “ ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy.” As long as the rabbis are not informed that the child is being raised in two religions, they can teach, and hopefully attract, this growing population. When we first started working on this 25 years ago, there was a tremendous amount of resistance,” “Most clergy would say you simply could not do this, this will confuse the children and it’s bad for the marriage – they just could not begin to conceptualize it.”</p>
<p>The Interfaith Community first started in 1987 with informal gatherings of about 20 families whose children attended the Trinity School in New York. By 2011, it counted nearly 150 families as members. Its activities include high holiday celebrations. “Our goal is not to replace the church and synagogue, but to provide a safe space for families who might feel uncomfortable or intimidated in those places,” said Sheila Gordon, co-founder and director of the organization. <a href="http://www.beinginterfaith.com/">For more info- see here.</a></p>
<p>From <a href="http://onbeingboth.wordpress.com/">their blog &#8220;on Being Both&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>1. Give children permission to explore and connect with all sides of their heritage. </p>
<p>2. Avoid setting up an expectation that the child will “choose” an identity someday. </p>
<p>3. Understand that those who are not born into bothness, even those who are intermarried, may never fully appreciate the idea of being both. </p>
<p>4. Insist on the joy of being both. In the face of skepticism&#8230;Communicate to your children that they represent hope for the future, bridges of peace and understanding, crucial new connections across rigid, deteriorating barriers.</p>
<p>5. Seek and develop communities that share your bothness.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In 2012, Peter Cole will release a book of poems by the Kabbalists from Yannai to the 20th century (Yale University Press). A few years ago he put out the supurb <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Poem-Christian-950-1492-Translation/dp/0691121958">The  Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain,  950–1492.</a> This interview is from the spring issue of <em>The Paris Review</em>. Many of Cole&#8217;s answers have a poetic quality and many of his sentences are worlds unto themselves. From his answers, his volume may be giving the world insights into Kabbalah that the transcend the historians. Cole is a believer in the power of language, especially Hebrew.</p>
<p><em><strong>I’ve never read poems quite like these—wild yet severe, also a little bit unearthly. Can you give some context for understanding them? What is their relation to Kabbalah?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The anthology these poems are drawn from—The Poetry of Kabbalah: Mystical Verse from the Jewish Tradition, forthcoming from Yale—covers some fifteen hundred years, and the poems emerge from diverse varieties of Jewish mystical thought and practice: Palestine of Late Antiquity, the eleventh- and twelfth-century Jewish communities of Muslim Spain and medieval Germany, and, later on, Christian Spain, Ottoman Palestine, Yemen, North Africa, Italy, and Eastern Europe.</em></p>
<p><em>By and large, Jewish mystics were preoccupied with other masochistic pleasures (rolling in nettles, fasting and wearing sackcloth, observing turbocharged versions of the traditional commandments, et cetera), so there isn’t a great deal of Kabbalistic poetry. But the best of it epitomizes an extraordinarily potent if lesser-known aspect of Judaism. <strong>That wild severity and otherworldliness you describe reflects the history of Jewish esotericism through the ages, some of which is in fact shockingly mythic, intricate, erotic, and often just plain weird.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>What drew you to this body of poetry, as a reader, poet, and translator?</strong></em><br />
<em>For one,<strong> its sheer potency and the steepness of its metaphysical ambition. </strong>Contemporary<strong> literary culture tends to doubt the power of poetry and is suspicious of verse that takes as its subject its own medium. But hymns treating nothing less than the nature of creation and the language that leads to that creation lie at the heart of the heart of Kabbalah’s country.</strong> So that drew me. The Kabbalists thought that song could, among many other things, extract light from the container of sound and bring about erotic union within the cosmic forces on high. That definitely got my attention. I was also drawn by the way in which Kabbalistic literature (the term kabbalah means “tradition” or, more literally, “reception” or “receptivity”) depicts a literary situation of acute authorial susceptibility to the interaction of words—sonic, semantic, architectonic. In short, the poetry of Kabbalah pressed a lot of my literary buttons.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The first poem of the selection, “From the Sky to the Heavens’ Heaven,” certainly has no doubts about the power of poetry. When I read it out loud I can’t help but feel it’s a poem to be chanted or sung. Who is the poet, Yannai, and what sort of occasion was this poem intended for?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yannai is a titanic poet whose incredible story Adina and I tell in some detail in Sacred Trash. He’s one of the major liturgical Hebrew poets of Byzantine Palestine, and his work overlaps with the Christian hymnology of the day. The some eight hundred poems that now make up his oeuvre were lost for nearly a thousand years, during which time he was known primarily as the author of one hymn in the Passover Haggadah and, more notoriously, for reportedly murdering his star pupil, another poet, by placing a scorpion in his sandal. Like Bach writing cantatas for churchgoers in Leipzig, Yannai composed “From the Sky to the Heavens’ Heaven” and numerous other works on commission for a synagogue in late sixth- or early seventh-century Palestine. <strong>It seems that symphonic works of this sort were meant to intensify the experience of prayer for worshippers by “making new” both their devotion and their understanding of the weekly reading from scripture, which the poems gloss in a highly eccentric way. </strong>(This particular poem is spun out of Yannai’s “commentary” on the Tower of Babel story.) Some scholars say the hymns were originally intended not only to ornament the standard liturgy, but to replace it.</em></p>
<p><em>In any event, the “performance” of these poems apparently drew large crowds. And as you note, they were almost certainly sung—perhaps with a chorus or with the congregation chiming in.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What you say about making it new reminds me of the third poem, an extract from </strong><strong>The Book of Creation</strong><strong>, which seems to be a rewrite of Genesis or maybe of John 1:1 (“In the beginning was the Word”). The poem’s representation of God—if that’s who He is—is very physical, almost demiurgic: he carves and quarries and weighs&#8230; </strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Book of Creation (or Formation) does constitute a revolutionary, imaginative line of Jewish thought. It’s a bizarre and not altogether fathomable work, and we know almost nothing about its author or the circumstances of its composition. But one thing that seems clear is that <strong>it amounts to an ars poetica, where the “made thing,” the product of poesis, is the world itself. God in this scheme constructs through language, which is to say that the cosmos is a literary creation.</strong> Working on this excerpt I kept thinking of The Book of Creation, anachronistically, as a radically theological inflection of what Ezra Pound said was the poet’s central task: to build a world.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>You’ve already translated several volumes of medieval Hebrew verse. Did these Kabbalistic poems offer special difficulties to you as a translator?</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Their abstraction was a challenge, as was the almost total absence, in the early work, of what we think of now as a personal voice.</strong> The Poetry of the Palaces—and many other selections in the anthology—<strong>present a verse that’s rooted in the magical power of letters and words, their shapes, sounds, and the cadences they create in combination. Experience in this literature is acoustic and rhythmic rather than psychological in the conventional sense, though this doesn’t mean that emotional struggle, growth, and insight aren’t at its core. Central to the quest that drives these poems is the verse’s ability to animate abstract understanding, to set up a palpable, percussive current that links syllable to syllable and word to word in a progression that leads toward heightened perception and, sometimes, a kind of ecstasy.</strong> But I’ve always been drawn to a tactile sort of abstraction in the arts, and to a poetry that does intense and impassioned work beyond narrow definitions of the self. So, if anything, these difficulties just made the challenge all the more enticing.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The absence of a personal voice is striking in the second poem, “To Rise on High,” which has a lot of verbs in the infinitive but no subject. What’s going on there?</strong></em><br />
<em>Your guess is as good as mine. But I do love that poem.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Were there any English verse models you found helpful while working on your translations?</strong></em><br />
<em>It’s hard to say. In the translations of the early medieval work <strong>I let the Hebrew have its way with me</strong> and with English, and there were no particular models, at least none that I was conscious of. Elsewhere in the anthology, all sorts of poetries hover further off in the wings: at least one of the poems has a gust, or ghost, of Wordsworth in its sails, and if pressed I suppose I could identify distant echoes of the middle English and early English Renaissance lyric, Blake, the metaphysicals and Hopkins, occasionally Whitman, maybe Stephen Crane and certainly Hart Crane, even Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan. Reception is reception.</em></p>

				<p>Do you ever get frustrated when someone preaches a liberal universal doctrine and then tell you the only way to know that universal is through Orthodoxy?  When everyone, especially those who are non-religious, already accept a universal ideal but it is claimed to be only available to the faithful. Well we get that full force in a new book by Rob Bell, <em>Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell, and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived </em>(HarperOne).</p>
<p>Bell teaches that God’s love is greater than Christianity but one needs to be an Evangelical to know that about God. His book is turning into the biggest print and internet controversy in a while. Many clergy spoke about him last week or will speak this week. The internet is spreading this controversy rapidly.</p>
<p>Bell who draws 10, 000 to his service at his Mars Hill Church in Grand Rapids but all across North America he has a big constituency.  His liberalism seems to be where many Evangelicals are currently at in their faith. But that is why there is a controversy. Bell speaks liberalism even though he is a card carrying Evangelical. Bell teaches that religious belief wont affect afterlife. He offers a warn, kind, and comfortable version of Christianity. All the tenets are palpable. His theology can be seen as overcoming a strict Evangelical upbringing. Once upon a time people sorted themselves out by liberal and evangelical and knew the categories. But now that liberal and evangelical refer just as much to schools, seminaries, summer camps and neighborhoods, we have people raised in the Evangelical world who are completely liberal. </p>
<p>Evangelicals have condemned him and liberals have found him too parochial by saying that universalism is only in the Church. What I find interesting is the nature of the arguments. Most of his critiques and critics have not actually read his book outside of the press release, blogs, and a chapter or two. Bell is called a heretic by the Evangelical right and called names but one see little actually engagement with the theological issues. </p>
<p>Only Martin Bashir of MSNBC took Rob Bell apart as lacking theology.  Bashir  himself said about most interviews:</p>
<blockquote><p>One Christian radio program interviewed Bashir about his questions… Bashir begins, for instance, by pointing out that most people who do interviews such as this haven’t even read the book. He says he did read the book, also went to two academic libraries, and interviewed three scholars (including two with no religious affiliation) and found the book to be evasive, disingenuous and ahistorical. Much of the interview gets into discussions of theology, history, the challenges with the type of evangelicalism Bell was raised in, etc. The questions aren’t the most interesting but Bashir’s answers do give lots to think about journalism and how it is practiced <a href="http://www.getreligion.org/2011/03/a-palatable-comfortable-christianity">h/t getrelgion</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the video to see Rob Bell squirm.<br />
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='500' height='282' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vg-qgmJ7nzA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Mark Galli  of the Evangelical magazine Christianity Today tears Rob Bell to shreds from an <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/april/lovewins.html">Evangelical perspective here. </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The prepublication buzz centered on Bell&#8217;s flirtation with universalism. He makes the universalist case most fully in one chapter, while avoiding the word universalist. He points out the many New Testament passages that point in this direction, </p>
<p>It&#8217;s rhetorically compelling, but he misleads at points. </p>
<p>In fact, he says, both Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection can be understood in ways that make perfect sense to modern ears. For Bell, the Cross is &#8220;a symbol of an elemental reality, one we all experience,&#8221; and the Resurrection is not a new concept, but &#8220;something that has always been true. It&#8217;s how the world works.&#8221; He&#8217;s referring to that pattern of death and rebirth.</p>
<p>One has to ask, then, if Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection are merely an expression of &#8220;how the universe works,&#8221; why all the bother? Why do we need Jesus to come and die and rise when this is something we see daily in the fabric of the universe, a knowledge that, as Bells suggests, we have instinctively sensed all along? </p>
<p>He correctly notes in the preface that many have taught what he teaches or hints at in the book. Names that come immediately to mind include Friedrich Schleiermacher, Albrecht Ritschl, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Tillich. Schleiermacher was keen on mining our innate religious sensibilities (the things we&#8217;ve intuited are true) to ground Christian faith. Ritschl celebrated the kingdom ethics of Jesus. Bultmann argued that first-century metaphors and worldviews should be abandoned. Tillich wrote of faith as accepting our acceptance. All these themes run through Bell&#8217;s book, sometimes in compelling ways. </p>
<p>These thinkers, of course, are all representatives of the tradition called liberal Protestantism. By associating Bell with this tradition, I&#8217;m not suggesting that he is beyond the pale or that he holds no orthodox views. I&#8217;m trying to place him in theological context. </p>
<p>Most Christians grasp that to demythologize one doctrine is to make the others less coherent. They recognize that a Christianity that teaches about &#8220;a God without wrath [who] brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a Cross&#8221; (H. Richard Niebuhr&#8217;s classic summary of liberalism) does not reflect the thickness of biblical revelation nor lived reality. And they see that when all is said and done, there is no painful contradiction between the love and justice of God. That in the end, not only does love win, but justice, too</p></blockquote>
<p>From an <a href="http://trevinwax.com/2011/03/15/rob-bell-love-wins-taking-evangelicalisms-temperature/">Evangelical blog asking</a>: why is this is about groups of liberal and conservatives and not about theology?:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> Taking Evangelicalism’s Temperature By Trevin Wax </em><br />
The furor over Rob Bell’s new book, Love Wins, shows no signs of subsiding. The development of the discussion has caused me to reflect on what a fever is and what it represents. <strong>Fevers don’t show up without a cause</strong>. A high temperature points to a bigger problem. It’s the sign that the immune system has kicked in and is fighting off an infection of some sort.<br />
Response #1: The Fever is the Problem<br />
When bloggers and pastors began responding to the promotional materials for Love Wins, many evangelicals used the occasion to point out their disagreement with the young, restless, and Reformed instead of dealing with the substantive issues Bell’s book brings to the surface. Conservative evangelicals sounded the alarm that Bell’s book was unorthodox, and a number of evangelicals threw stones at the messengers: You’re an alarmist. You’re just a bunch of heresy hunters. You can’t get along with anyone you disagree with.<br />
Imagine being in a crowded building when the fire alarm goes off. Instead of looking for the fire or heading for the exit, everyone stands around the alarm and begins discussing its shortcomings:<br />
“Wow, this alarm sounds so shrill. It hurts my ears. Someone should change the tone!”<br />
“Who pulled this alarm anyway? I don’t smell any smoke. I don’t see a reason for the warning.”<br />
“Well, I can smell smoke, but I’ve got to tell you – these alarms just go looking for smoke. Who do they think they are anyway?”<br />
In other words, fevered discussion of theological truth and error is the problem. The fever is the issue. Why not take a Tylenol and some Dramamine and chill out?</p>
<p>Response #2: The Body is Okay with Infection<br />
Rob Bell’s universalistic tendencies are nothing new. In fact, we’ve always had a segment of evangelicals who lean in this direction. So let’s not get too worked up about universalism. After all, the denial or redefinition of hell isn’t that big of a deal in the long run.<br />
To be fair, this kind of evangelical isn’t denying that universalism is heterodox. Returning to the sickness metaphor, I believe this group sees universalism as problematic. But the underlying message is this: This problem isn’t life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelicalism has always been a big tent. The question before us today is, How big can the tent be before it caves in? How big can the tent be before “evangelical” means nothing more than “a professing Christian who is serious about what he/she believes”?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>From the New York Times treating it as a media craze&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/us/05bell.html?_r=2">Pastor Stirs Wrath With His Views on Old Questions</a> By ERIK ECKHOLM<br />
Published: March 4, 2011 </p>
<blockquote><p>His book comes as the evangelical community has embraced the Internet and social media to a remarkable degree, so that a debate that once might have built over months in magazines and pulpits has instead erupted at electronic speed. </p>
<p>By that same evening, “Rob Bell” was one of the top 10 trending topics on Twitter. Within 48 hours, Mr. Taylor’s original blog had been viewed 250,000 times. Dozens of other Christian leaders and bloggers jumped into the fray and thousands of their readers posted comments on both sides of the debate, though few had yet seen the entire book. </p>
<p> “Rob Bell is tapping into a younger generation that really wants to open up these questions,” he said. “He is also tapping into the fear of the traditionalists — that these differing views of heaven and hell will compromise the Christian message.”<br />
While sliding close to what critics consider the heresy of “universalism” — that all humans will eventually be saved — he never uses the term. </p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/files/2011/03/LoveWinsReview.pdf">a pdf manifesto</a> of an Evangelical conservative. This one phrased the controversy in terms similar to Orthodox Judaism. </p>
<blockquote><p>Love Wins has ignited such a firestorm of controversy because it’s the current fissure point for a larger fault-line. As younger generations come up against an increasingly hostile cultural environment, they are breaking in one of two directions—back to robust orthodoxy (often Reformed) or back to liberalism. The neo-evangelical consensus is cracking up. Love Wins is simply one of many tremors.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Elie Wiesel is known for making up his own Hasidic tales to fit his ideas of arguing with God and his views of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misotheism">misotheism</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misotheism#Terminology">dystheism.</a> I used to get lots of phone calls trying to identify Wiesel’s original Hasidic tales. Buber may take out the particualism of Torah uMizvot to make a story with universal appeal but you can always identify the original story. Wiesel is confident and free enough to invent things, put lines from Camus and Doestoevsky in the mouth of his Hasidic protagonists and make his Hasidim share his angry arguing with a God for His evil deeds. Wiesel screams at his critics that the story was from his childhood teachers and his critics were not there in Sighet where he claims tohave heard the stories.  </p>
<p>But it seems Wiesel has also applied his craft of memoir (he rejects the label novelist) directly to Martin Buber. There is a story about the Jewish-Christian encounter that seemed not to be like Buber in thought or character for several reasons. The false story downplays the difference between the faiths since the real Buber was a harsh critic of Christianity.  The story has an agnostic or relative edge to it- the real Buber was a believer in a universalism of hallowed everyday action. And the real Buber was not seeking to be pragmatically cleaver in a &#8220;got you&#8221; kind of way. </p>
<p>After emailing many people, it seem that the origin of the story is Elie Wiesel in the late 1980’s. Many people picked it up as a true. Using this story skewers real positions. Here is the probably phony story:</p>
<blockquote><p>My good friends, what is the difference between you and me? Both of us, all of us believe, because we are religious, in the coming of the Messiah. You believe that the Messiah came, went back, and that you are waiting for Him for the second coming. We Jews believe He hasn&#8217;t come yet, but He will come. In other words, we are waiting. You for the second coming, we for the first coming. Let&#8217;s wait together.&#8221; After a pause, he said, &#8220;And when He will come, we will ask Him, have you been here before?&#8221; Said Buber, &#8220;I hope I will be behind Him and I will whisper in His ear, please do not answer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Elie Wiesel, All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs (New York: Knopf, 1995), pp. 354-55.<br />
Or from Wiesel&#8217;s commencement <a href="http://www.humanity.org/printview.php?page=wiesel_at_depaul&amp;sectionName=voices">Speech at Depaul</a></p>
<p>Now back to the real Buber.<br />
In his <em>Two Types of Faith </em>Buber distinguishes between  two kinds of faith. The Hebraic emunah: total trust and reliance on God; where one shows trust through actions.  Paul&#8217;s version of faith is pistis: a more intellectual belief in the cognitive truth of something.  </p>
<p>The closest you will find in Buber’s actual writings to anything like alleged story is in &#8220;The Two Foci of the Jewish Soul&#8221; in <em>Israel and the World</em>, p. 39 (pages varies between editions) he asks, speaking of differences of Jews and Christians: &#8220;what do you and we have in common?&#8221; And he answers:&#8221; A book and an expectation.&#8221; Then he goes on to say: &#8220;But we can wait for the advent of the One together, and there are moments when we may prepare the way before him together&#8230;.&#8221; Even here we find Buber speaking of preparing the way through holy action.</p>
<p>Whenever Buber did encounter other faiths he always stressed the immediacy of the present moment.  He found commonalities between religions in ecstasy, service, intention, humility&#8212;not messianic doctrine. Truth is opening oneself up to others. One is to strive for transparency and pure I-Thou dialogue, not hiding truth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Religiosity, I say, is the urge of man to live in commune with the unconditioned, and his will to bring this about through his deeds and into the world of man&#8230; True religiosity is doing&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Having awakened to an awareness of their universal being, individual beings open themselves to one another, disclose themselves to one another, help one another.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To become human is what we are created for&#8221;, and approaching God is only possible by becoming human.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until I hear otherwise, I will take it as a story imposing an alien theology on Buber. </p>

				<p>From last Year &#8211; “Masekhet Purim”, a humorous parody of the Talmud, is believed to have  first been written in the first half of the 14th century by Kalonymus  ben Kalonymus. It later developed into several different versions. <a href="http://www.hebrewbooks.org/33628">Here  is the</a> Kol Bo L’Purim with the Kiddish, hagadah, selichot,  teshuvot, akdamot, and more. Download it- It is only 31 pages, bring  it with you on Purim</p>
<p>This year VBM provided a translation of the R. Chaim Vital and Rav Nachman on why one must drink &#8220;until one does not know.&#8221; Here are the basic translations with some of the context. <a href="http://vbm-torah.org/archive/chag71/purim71.htm"><br />
Full 10 page version from VBM here. </a> <a href="http://breslov.org/dvar-torah-for-purim/"><br />
Very short Cliff notes version</a> from Ozer Bergman.</p>
<p><strong>Purim in Chassidic Thought: “Until He Doesn&#8217;t Know” By Rav Itamar Eldar</strong></p>
<p>The gemara cites the following statement in the name of Rava:<br />
<strong>A person is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai.&#8221; (Megilla 7b)</strong></p>
<p><strong>It seems to demand nullification of the intellect to the point of losing the capacity to clearly distinguish between Haman being evil and Mordekhai being blessed.</strong> Jewish thought, and Chassidic thought in particular, attempted to reach a deeper understanding of this law – drinking wine to the point of drunkenness – which has become one of the central features of Purim.</p>
<p>R. Chayyim Vital writes as follows in the name of his teacher, the Arizal:</p>
<blockquote><p>That which our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, that a person is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; – this means as follows: It is known that in every kelipa there is a spark of holiness that gives it life, and should it be removed, [the kelipa] will be left with no vitality and immediately it will totally disappear. <strong>Now on this great day, when there is this great illumination, we want the vitality of this illumination to reach this spark as well</strong>, but not that it should reach so far to illuminate the kelipa. For this reason a person must get drunk on this day, to the point that he does not know the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai.&#8221; For he may err and give a blessing to that spark in the kelipa, and it too will be blessed, but its blessing will not have perfect intention, for if it would have, it would receive a great deal and the kelipa would also be blessed. [Alternate reading: Therefore he must say &#8220;blessed Haman,&#8221; to draw light also to that spark, and therefore he must say it without intention, since he is drunk and has already lost his mind. For were it with intention, God forbid, it would also illuminate the kelipa.] (Peri Etz Chayyim, Sha&#8217;ar Rosh Chodesh, Chanuka U-Purim, ch. 6)</p></blockquote>
<p>The key to these questions seems to lie in understanding the state of the kelipa and the Divine spark concealed within it. As R. Chayyim Vital puts it, &#8220;It is known that in every kelipa, there is a spark of holiness that gives it life.&#8221; The kelipa, which symbolizes the evil found in the world, exists by virtue of the Divine spark that is concealed within it and gives it life. <strong>Without that Divine spark hidden within it, it could not exist. The ramifications of this point are important. The kabbalistic reference to the &#8220;Divine spark giving life to the kelipa&#8221; asserts that the very fact of evil&#8217;s existence is its meaning, and that it is by the will and intention of God that it continues to exist.</strong><br />
THE GOAL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT TO KNOW</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge, as it is expressed in the words of the Arizal, involves a restriction and limitation of light, and in this manner, a blessing may be given to evil. R. Natan adopts an entirely different approach in the name of his teacher, R. Nachman of Breslov:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the aspect of &#8220;A person is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8216;cursed Haman&#8217; and &#8216;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; (Megilla 7b). For Purim is the primary [time] for subjugating the filth of the serpent, which is sadness, the aspect of &#8220;in sorrow shall you eat of it&#8221; (Bereishit 3:17), as stated above. At that time, we must raise the joy from the depths of the kelipot… until we merit by way of the joy to achieve the aspect of the nine palaces as stated above, through which we attain the infinite light … which is the aspect of the goal of knowledge that we are not to know, as stated above. Therefore, a person is obligated to drink, that is, to get drunk on Purim for the sake of the joy, as it is written: &#8220;Wine that gladdens the heart of man&#8221; (Tehilim 104:15). And he must increase the joy until he merits by way of the drunkenness and the joy of Purim to reach the aspect of the goal of knowledge that we are not to know, which is the aspect of &#8220;until he no longer knows, etc.&#8221; For the primary hold of good and evil, which is the aspect of &#8220;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; and &#8220;cursed Haman,&#8221; is from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the root of which stems from &#8220;nirgan mafrid aluf&#8221; (&#8220;a whisperer separates close friends;&#8221; Mishlei 16:18). That is, it separates the aspect of Keter, which is the aspect of alef, the aspect of wonder which orders and settles the minds, thereby preventing the minds from their pursuit. For the primary attainment of knowledge is precisely the aspect of the goal of knowing that we are not to know. For the aspect of not knowing is the primary goal of knowledge. For he who merits this, knowledge and lack of knowledge are contained together, they being the aspect of pursuit and hindrance, which are truly one at their root. Then evil is altogether nullified, for the primary hold of evil is the lack of knowledge and its concealment, which follows from the excessive light that causes the vessels to shatter. This is because they do not contain knowledge and lack of knowledge together (as will be further explained below with God&#8217;s help). <strong>Therefore, on Purim we must get drunk to the point that we reach such joy until we merit the aspect of the aforementioned goal of knowledge, where pursuit and hindrance are combined, they being knowledge and lack of knowledge. The two are combined together in the aspect of the goal of knowledge that we are not to know, where all evil is entirely nullified, as explained above. This is the aspect of &#8220;until he no longer knows the difference between &#8216;cursed Haman&#8217; and &#8216;blessed Mordekhai.'&#8221; For there we cannot talk about good and evil, for there all is one, all is good, as mentioned above. </strong>(Likutei Halakhot, Hilkhot Nefilat Apayim 4:7)</p></blockquote>
<p>R. Natan identifies the obligation to be unable to differentiate between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai&#8221; with one of the fundamental principles in the thought of R. Nachman of Breslov, the paradoxical assertion that the goal of knowledge is that we are not to know.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, R. Natan writes as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, one is obligated to drink on Purim until he no longer knows the difference between &#8220;cursed Haman&#8221; and &#8220;blessed Mordekhai.&#8221; For there he is above knowledge, and there it is inappropriate to say, &#8220;cursed Haman,&#8221; for there it is entirely good, above the middot, above days of good and days of evil, as stated above. This is the aspect of the secret of the red heifer, which is the aspect of statute (chuka), above knowledge: it defiles the ritually pure and purifies the ritually impure. This secret will remain incomprehensible until the future when the hidden Torah will be revealed, as stated above. (Likutei Halakhot, Hilkhot Purim 4:5)</p></blockquote>
<p>Waiving knowledge is, indeed, a little scary, just as it is a little scary to put on a mask and lose our appearance.</p>
<p>At this frightening moment, a moment without knowledge, a moment of drunkenness, we can do nothing but look inwards, into ourselves, into our essence, into the center of knowledge – to the Ein within us, which is only revealed when we remove all the garments. At this moment, there is no cursed and no blessed, no profane and no holy, no impure and no pure – there is only blessed silence, that allows us for a moment to look at the Ein, at repentance which is above the Torah.</p>
<p>The foundation of repentance that disregards the world of phenomena and seeks the blessing of the essence reveals itself not only when we get drunk on Purim to the point that we no longer know the difference between cursed Haman and blessed Mordekhai,</p>
