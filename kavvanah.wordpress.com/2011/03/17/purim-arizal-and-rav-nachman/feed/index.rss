					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s interesting that Rav Eldar didn&#039;t cite  Rav Chayyim Vittal&#039;s other opinion in the Pri Etz Chayyim about how the side of evil is sustained on Purim.

And I also found it interesting that he neglected to discuss the obvious parallel to the sa-ir l&#039;azazel on Yom Kippur.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i have long thought that the statement &quot;the goal of knowledge is to not know&quot; 
to be central to rebbi nachman&#039;s thought. My first hint of this was when i discovered that one of the chapters in the lekutai moharan that mention this was according to tradition originally part of the burnt book which is considered rebbi nachman&#039;s hidden teachings as compared to the lekutai moharan itself.
I think the lesson this comes from is LM volume II chapter 73]]></description>
