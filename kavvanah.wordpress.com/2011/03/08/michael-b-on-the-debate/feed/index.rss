					<description><![CDATA[Thank you all for taking part in this discussion, and especially to Alan Brill for facilitating.  I think it touches on some important issues.  Michael, your framing is very helpful.  What are the stakes?  Is it about the legitimacy or the primacy of either of these two teachers or their respective practices?  If that is the case I think it is a sad statement on the health of anything close to a post-denominational Judaism.  I imagine post-denominational Judaism to be a vision of vibrant diversity and inclusivity.  This necessitates the genuine love of those who take another path.  To be sure, the politics of Jewish denominationalism actually discourage the life of Jewish communities.  And denominationalism seems to be the tacit frame of the entire debate.  Jews need better communities, not better doctrines.  Though I am disappointed that Landes and Green have not debated thoughtfully, I believe that Green began on the defensive.  Landes&#039; original review seemed especially threatening since, it not only argued that Green&#039;s ideas were not Jewish enough, but it did so loudly through the Jewish Review of Books which, as a publication, seems to masquerade its conservative political biases as liberal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Michael: 

I think the substance at stake in this round of fury has more to do with place and possibilities and less to do with the truth about God, Torah, and Israel. How far can Judaism open out into the big world without dissipating? I believe Magid said something similar in a review of Green&#039;s book in Zeek.

While I for one have all kinds of philosophical problems relating to Green&#039;s book (can we call him &quot;Art&quot; and Landes &quot;Danny&quot;?), I think he creates for Jewish theology and Judaism a bigger picture, whereas Danny wants to work at the more intimate scale of a table (his metaphor, not mine) or a persian miniature (this is a compliment!).  

Re: Danny&#039;s question (and a previous poster who asked about secular Judaism), I think radical Judaism has a great pair of legs. I grew up in a secular, Kaplanian, leftwing Zionist home in the 1970s and 1980s. I fell in love with I.B. Singer, Spinoza, Nietzsche, Buber, Kaplan, and Rubenstein. They made it possible for me to place myself religiously, to open out to Bible and eventually midrash and Talmud, and to do so in good faith. 

Maybe that&#039;s just me. It&#039;s a big world out there, with lots of possibilities and lots of room for small intimate places in which to debate this or that truth. Alan&#039;s blog is one such place. Let&#039;s worry less and respect each other more, no?]]></description>
