i think that you are mixing two categories. The thinker who is of a faith and a thinker who represents a faith. Charles Taylor and Alister MacIntyre are Catholic but do not represent the Church. Your list starts with academics who fit in the Taylor category and ends with those in the clerical category.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Starting with a broad definition of Orthodoxy, some people who can enter participate would be:

Suzanne Stone  (Human rights and Law) 
Moshe Halbertal (numerous topics including just war &#038; ineffability of God)
Richard Cohen (Phen. of religion/ethics)
R. Marc-Alain Ouakin (Religion/post-modernity) 
Rav Cherlow 
R. Benny Lau (social critique)
Yehudah Mirsky 

If I thought about a bit more, I&#039;m sure 10 more names would come to mind -]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Judaism some theists aren&#039;t exactly theists as we learn from your next post, and some atheists be they Zionists or Jewish nationalists are closer to Jewish ideals than many a pro forma theist. In my opinion, theist -atheist debates whether of the  philosophical theology or or the Hitchens-Dennet-Dawkins variety are not central to the core divide in Jewish life. Nor am I convinced that placing &quot; the concerns of faith, revelation, and tradition into secular discourse&quot; is the best way to formulate the issue. Since being a Jew has more than one aspect, most everyone has learnt how to feel comfortable using only a secular language in many contexts  and conversely in adapting religious traditions and language within a not-particularly religious way of life. The core divide in Jewish life seems to me to be over the issue of modernity understood as autonomy and self determination. Do each of us have the freedom, the right to live the life we choose to live, constrained only by moral and legal considerations, or must we also limit our freedom by the constraints imposed by torah and mitzvots, however understood? And since we all know or should know there are no knockdown, bang-bang-your-dead arguments for either side of this issue, the discussion turns on weighing a variety of considerations, some emotional, some practical with the result that different people can in all good conscience arrive at very different conclusions. How to create  some unity in such a world becomes a problem for most every Jew.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A Catholic cardinal has a lot more leeway in what he is allowed to espouse than an American orthodox rabbi or academic today. The MO intellectual has to operate under the pretense that any theological position emerges organically from tradition - whether Biblical, Talmudic, or a clever hasidic story (Lord Sacks gets a lot of mileage from the latter.)  I am much more interested in a dialogue with a representative who thinks that dialogue itself can result in a constructive theology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You sliently jump from dialigue to debate, but they are not identical. Dialogue is not confrontational, or need not be, and is not about winning hearts away from the opponent&#039;s team; it&#039;s about finding common ground to act together, and about making each other aware of what irks them about the other, so that tensions can be reduced.

The Vatican seems to enter a dialogue, not a debate. If that&#039;s correct, I think we should follow their lead to distinguish between the two.]]></description>
