I wouldn&#039;t fault someone for adopting the language of his audience. You work with whatever tools are available. (But I will not be using this meme in any forthcoming sermon - not my thing).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Did everyone fail statistics?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes. In my experience, not only rabbis have difficulty with statistics, but economists, too (or at least the business types who specialize in economics for their MBA). Even people who took a stat course or two. Somehow, common sense is hard to come by, and once combined with math, it becomes a very rare commodity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But on the other hand, it is interesting to see Orthodox Jews think that wellness are Jewish values. ... Aish Hatorah is busy producing videos and articles on Judaism and happiness – in fifty years we will look upon this happiness and Judaism in the same way as we look at the 1950s “Democracy and Torah” “American Liberty and Torah” as a quaint product of its time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ah, but pray, tell, wouldn&#039;t that jibe well with the call of one of my teachers, to develop, for the suburban Orthodox Jew, instead of the intellectually demanding, abstract, elitist Torah u&#039;Madda, a more accessible, more relevant to them Torah u&#039;Sports ve&#039;Dougies? (hint to readers: I am referring to an article by our esteemed blog owner).

Quaint products of the time are also important, not as new philosophical inroads, but on order to articulate Jewish wisdom in the language of contemporary speech.  It&#039;s not for everyone to be a contrarian counterculturalist.

&lt;blockquote&gt;They once told me that in their community Teaneck is seen as “observant but not religious.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I think we should not discount the possibility that this says more about interdenominaional competition than about facts (though it may also be partially factual).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now I understand why it is that it was the Prince of Denmark who famously declared: &quot;There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so&quot; (Hamlet, Act II, Scene II, line 259).  Could this be a statement of Positive Psychology on Happiness &#038; WellBeing? Or a good Beshtian Devar Musar? Or a BUJU Purim Torah?  Maybe Bretzlav Hasidism should be happiest - after all it is a great Mitzvah to be in continuous joy is an idea invented by R. Nahman? Alan, please keep us smiling with your observant comments on human nature...]]></description>
