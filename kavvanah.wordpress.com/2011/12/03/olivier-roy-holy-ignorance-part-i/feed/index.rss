					<description><![CDATA[Interesting and thanks for the post.  His new&#039;ish book sounds like an extrapolation of his thesis in the 2007 (English translation of his 2005) &quot;Secularism Confronts Islam&quot; which was a thought-provoking read.

I look forward to your opinions post...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan,

As always thanks for calling attention to a provocative and thoughtful book.  That said, after having read significant portions of the book I feel that Roy&#039;s expertise as an Islamicist with a personal and intellectual background in early modern Christianity are clear, whereas his grasp of contemporary Judaism is severely limited.  Although his concept of de-territorialisation in offers an interesting framework for addressing Chabad&#039;s world-wide growth,  it doesn&#039;t appreciate the fact that no matter where you stand on the Jewish religious spectrum the return to territoriality via Israel represents a key underpinning to numerous initiatives and reactions that have emerged in the last few decades.  Moreover, territoriality accounts for a lot of what distinguishes Israeli religion - and foremost some of its fundamentalist elements - from Judaism in the Diaspora.  The radical Eretz Yisrael movement is an obvious example.  More nuanced, however, are the ways living in a Jewish welfare state has given non-Zionist groups the license to develop and behave in ways that they would never dream of if they were not in a sovereign environment.

All the best,
Adam]]></description>
