					<description><![CDATA[Alan,

A huge thanks for these posts.  After your first one I picked up a copy of Roy&#039;s book.  His analysis is very thought provoking. Unfortunately the book was poorly translated so without your posts I suspect I would be missing much of what he is saying.  Also the comments from followers of your blog and your responses to them are exceptionally well thought out.  Rov todah!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for these posts. Very very interesting.

One thing I want to note, is the apparent inner contradiction facing the National-Religious in Israel who are moving toward a Haredi worldview (i.e. חרד&quot;ל). What Roy points to seams to be right: the emphasis on countering the secular culture at all costs, of building a fence between the camps, the building blocks of which are halachic fetishes of form (e.g. the whole issue of women singing in the army - if you&#039;ve followed the news from here). BUT, if so, this stands in complete contrast to the avowed vision of sacralisation of the secular and turning the state of Israel into the seat of God and the summation of Geula. The Kooknics&#039; ethos has always been the integration of the Holy and the Secular. I think this inner contradiction is just now beginning to be noticed by many of them, who went passively along with the hyper-nomianism of the last decades.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/oliver-roy-holy-ignorance-part-iii/#comment-3859&quot;&gt;ej&lt;/a&gt;.

EJ-
Your first paragraph helps me see that Roy is a bit too rigidly structural and does not the movement of human protagonists. 
Your second paragraph is exactly his point, and will be my final post on Roy. One need a cultural sphere and a religious sphere. The former giving me everything from academia, history, culture, folk, society. The latter returning to our central beliefs, which for misnagdim is Torah and mizvot.

You wrote:
&lt;em&gt;You seem to feel since we basically have a secular mind set, we are incapable of serious, sustained religious thought&lt;/em&gt;

No, since we have a religious thought only concerned with boundary issues against the secular (or fighting the boundaries) then we have neither serious religious or secular thought. &lt;em&gt;It is exactly your point in &quot;One can have memorized every page of Slifkin You and I  and still be a cultural and Talmudic am- haaretz.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; You and I share a view of a constant need for &quot;the life-cycle pondering/working on questions&quot; that requires both culture and religion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why does Oliver call both those who choose to stay religious &#038; BTs examples of conversion to the Jewish faith? The parent ate a smail kezayis matzoh, the next generation ate a humongous kezayis. They moved to the right. But over time, when they have kids even frummer than they, they eventually realize what’s going on, and re-identify with their parents in some new more flexible way, as will their children. And of course Orthodoxy itself changes from one generation to the next as people negotiate their relationship to their parents and their culture. The ability to pass on at least the basic Talmudic/halachic culture is shown again and again all over Orthodoxy. No big problem. The problem exists mainly in the more humanistic culture vulture denominations. Is this a problem for Oliver’s thesis?
As for how to protect oneself from becoming fundamentalist and a yahoo illiterate, I feel the best way is to pursue a separate secular path that need not integrate with Orthodoxy point for point. One can have memorized every page of Slifkin and still be a cultural and Talmudic am- haaretz. I say Proust and Talmud, differential equations and the Mahral,  Mahler and the Noam Elimelech…one needs a flexible plan for secular study and immersion in contemporary culture, each person according to his interests, temperament and madreiga, and one needs a plan for becoming knowledgeable in Torah.  And then go for it. Integrate when you are join a retirement community. 
You seem to feel since we basically have a secular mind set, we are incapable of serious, sustained religious thought. I don’t know this. A serious person finds himself in each decade of the life-cycle pondering/working on questions she feels are deep and important. She might be knee deep in the middle of psychoanalysis or understanding the Zohar or immersed in German-Jewish culture or working through the mussar of Kelm. That’s where she is. Why should this be automatically labeled non-religious thought, unless you  have a certain scholastic Maimonidean  picture of what the religious mind is supposed to contemplate?]]></description>
