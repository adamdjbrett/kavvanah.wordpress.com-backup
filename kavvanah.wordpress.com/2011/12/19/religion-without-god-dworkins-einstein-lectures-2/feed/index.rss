					<description><![CDATA[As a consequence of my relationships with born-Jews who have chosen to become Buddhists, I&#039;ve read quite a bit about Buddhism and how it is considered by its adherents to be a religion even though it is god-less.  

According to Dukas and Hoffman (&quot;Albert Einstein, The Human Side&quot;, 1954), Einstein had some respect for Buddhism.

The latest book I&#039;ve read that addressed the subject clearly and coherently was Kosho Uchiyama&#039;s &quot;Opening the Hand of Thought&quot; (first published in 1993 and  republished in 2004).  Uchiyama was head priest at the Antaiji monastery near Kyoto until his death in 1999.

He states (page 92): &quot;Dissatisfied with the inability of technology to fulfill their lives, Westerners have come to show a deep concern for the East, straining to look into its essence and exploring Buddhism, which reveals a remarkable and unique characteristic among religions: Buddhism does not raise the question of god.  Consequently, for a time Christian-influenced scholars even denied it was a religion.  However, it is nonsense to decide whether or not a teaching is a religion by the presence or absence of the concept of god.  If we decide that a something qualifies as a religion only on that basis, then religion must have disappeared when the mythological worldview came to be replaced by the worldview of natural science.  The presence or absence of a god concept is not what is most fundamental, since religion must be that which teaches humanity what is most important in life and offers genuine spiritual peace.  In this most fundamental sense, Buddhism is pure religion.&quot;

Obviously, Uchiyama&#039;s ideas about religion are quite different than Jewish ones.]]></description>
