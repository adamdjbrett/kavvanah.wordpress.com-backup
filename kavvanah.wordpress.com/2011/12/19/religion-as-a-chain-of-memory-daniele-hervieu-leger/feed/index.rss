					<description><![CDATA[Collective memory is the felt experience of being part of the Jewish people, its history and destiny, and how one lives one&#039;s life, structured identity. The re-establishment of a Jewish state, Jewish sovereignty is the political manifistation of the Jewish people which, along with the Ingathering to Eretz Yisrael heralds the Third Jewish Commonwealth. That archeologists find evidence of prior Jewish civilizations which document written texts strengthens the case for Jewish peoplehood and sovereignty in Eretz Yisrael. Collective memory from a Jewish perspective only has meaning in the context of committment to Jewish practice and Jewish learning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/religion-as-a-chain-of-memory-daniele-hervieu-leger/#comment-3925&quot;&gt;ej&lt;/a&gt;.

Have the times really changed that much? I&#039;m not sure we aren&#039;t just confined by modernism&#039;s myopia. The Jewish experience is fractured to be sure (as always). A public discussion of return - as a revolt against the promises of assimilation with the inherent loss of identity in post-capitalist society, surely leads many to BT experiences and we bring with it a desire for a collective memory to merge with our individual/coerced memory of media. The new revolution might be tradition though a dialectical and materialist tradition to bridge our secular knowledge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is always the implication something wanting in constructed selected memories, because they  generally serve some political/religious program. But I think the situation for the individual is different. The recent history of Jews has been so unsettled, so many people frum-from- birth are descended from parents of different backgrounds; add in the ideology imposed by the yeshivas and the exposure to secular culture in  various degrees, and the formation of identities are no longer a natural process. We are not landed gentry or peasants with a settled way of life.  How people grow up, how they put it all together is no simple matter. And whether the process is conscious or not, there isn’t much choice but to construct an identity. We can imagine  the traditions of grandparents as say Oberlander and Russian, or Litvish and American Orthodox. No end to the possible  complexities. Or try a chassidish elementary school, a charedi –American HS, a stay in the Mir Jerusalem and college, professional school and a job downtown. If Henry James could make a career of negotiating between American and English refined taste, how much more complex are the spaces between our post-Holocaust inherited traditions. And this process is ongoing. As we learn more, grow older it is natural to reshuffle the weights we have assigned to the various influences in our lives, as well as our opinions about others different from us.  I realize part of being charedi is that identities are more preset, with fewer choices. But because of the narcissism of small differences I think the process today, even if attenuated, has similar experiential qualities. Everyone knows the absolute existential seriousness in choosing a hat, and the even more serious life choice of not wearing a hat. Sociologists might say these are mere markers defining the different communities, without inner religious substance. Maybe. But becoming an individual, finding one’s own way within an abundance  of “shulchan aruchs” is a serious, deep part of life, even if one would not call this process religious. .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good question - I don&#039;t think it would apply to Durkheim, for whom the coercive sides of community are never far away.  Berger I&#039;m not sure. As for Rav Kook, yes it would apply to much of him, and we&#039;re living with the consequences. Of course he was aware of the dark sides of things, and much more than we usually think, but there&#039;s no denying the overwhelmingly  optimistic tenor of his thought in the theologically key years of 1904-19, which certainly cast how he was read by Rav Zvi Yehudah et al.]]></description>

Wouldn&#039;t your comment apply equally well to Durkheim, Berger, or even Ader Hayakar?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t help but recall the comment by a former colleague with whom I was discussing Hervieu-Leger a few years ago (during the height of the second Intifada). &#039;Chains of memory are lyrical and evocative,&quot; he said, &quot;but what are they doing blowing themselves up in shopping malls?&quot; 
It&#039;s kind of flip, I know, but his comment stayed with me for its pointing to a kind of aestheticization of all kinds of things that takes place in the polite forums of academic study of religion, not only of Islam, but Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism and on (and admittedly, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m as guilty of that as anyone).]]></description>
