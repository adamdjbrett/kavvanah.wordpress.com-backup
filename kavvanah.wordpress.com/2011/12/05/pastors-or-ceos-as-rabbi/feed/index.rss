					<description><![CDATA[&quot;There has been a trend in the last 7-8 years to encourage Orthodox rabbis to be CEO’s of the congregation, get an MBA, learn how to control boards and build the metrics of your congregation.&quot;

I&#039;m in the fourth (and normally the last) year of YU-RIETS&#039; s&#039;mikha program.   I haven&#039;t seen *any* signs of this trend reflected in the content of its professional rabbinics classes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the real question is whether the rabbi is serving an existing community, or building a new community. When rabbis were hired by existing Jewish communities, a pastoral model (or the Jewish equivalent: the lamdan model) sufficed. When Jewish communities aren&#039;t self-sustaining, you need a ceo model.

My question is whether the shift at YU reflects a real perceived need with the Modern Orthodox commnity, or rather a competitive response to the successful CEO models of Chabad and Aish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The training for a rabbi all but demands striving for the CEO type position.  With rabbinical schools running 5 - 6 years and tuition putting grads into debt to the tune of six figures who can afford to be suffering servant?  To be sure, the on-demand role of chaplain has its place but the question needs to be asked: is rabbinic training appropriate or necessary?  Why not have a social worker or psychologist with additional pastoral or chaplaincy training serve in these roles?  I think one reason we don&#039;t do this is because we&#039;ve allowed the position of rabbi to take on more and more of the appearances and functions of the Christian minister/pastor.  For them, after all, the idea of being a servant is essential to their identity and theology!  Howard]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that in some of the big kiruv organizations, like Aish HaTorah, the &quot;corporate&quot; mind-set is the dominant one.  Aish is all about binging people in by using the up-to-date business models, as if the people Aish seeks to bring close to Hashem are consumers.]]></description>
