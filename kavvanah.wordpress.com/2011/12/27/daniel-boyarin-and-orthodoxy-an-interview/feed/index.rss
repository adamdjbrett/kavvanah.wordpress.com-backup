Gut moed.

And fair enough.  I&#039;m sorry if I implied anything to that effect.  I just took your line of argument as at least attacking the premise that belief in the historicity of the Torah was important to Judaism since (you averred) such a belief could never have been rendered in coherent terms.

Actually, I have been thinking of a refinement of the Potter Stewart argument as follows: you are undoubtedly correct that the members of the dor hamidbar would have had different subjective experiences of the same physical event, which then would have been reported in language in a different way.  And then this leads to your problem that we are relying on a multitude of potentially conflicting testimonials about an event, which becomes somewhat fuzzy.  
I still think that one can summon Potter Stewart in the way I did--i.e., that the fuzziness would have been limited because the experience would have been so qualitatively different from the usual run of human experience as to be unmistakable.  But I think we can make the point stronger.  In particular, key to our mesorah is that there is both Torah she b&#039;aal peh as well as Torah she&#039;bechtav.  Put differently, the issue of conflicting reports is irrelevant because the dor hamidbar collectively endorsed (to their children) a written report on the event they had experienced.  

The mesorah involves the intergenerational transmission of the mass experience of theophany accompanied by a text that was collectively endorsed as an authoritative documentation of the event.  It is as if Holocaust survivors collectively ratified a particular description of the event at the time of its happening as an authentic representation of their experience. (Of course, this all leads to the question of whether the mesorah really was passed down through an unbroken chain, and e.g., to the debates about Yoshiahu and Hilkiah what it means that they found a Sefer Torah, what about it was unknown, etc.  
As I said, I was less focused on whether there is sufficient warrant to believe in the historicity of the Torah than whether it is a coherent belief)

No one denied the historicity of the Torah. Just that your pornography argument since it is viewing an item in front of one - even with your use of the word ontology- is very different than a claim of mesorah, tradition, or  a-priori. The subjunctive epistemology of a past event was not implicit in your the logic of the American legal pornography argument. (I will be back tonight)]]></description>

Hmm... surely it has got to be worrisome to someone who believes in the historicity of Jesus that the best someone who is as knowledgeable as you are can do is to say that this is no longer an acceptable question (and like I said, it is interesting that by contrast, it is not acceptable to believe in the historicity of the Torah).

We dont question Shakespeare&#039;s existence anymore either. That was a skeptical trend from the early 20th century. 
Read one of the recent books - try Amy Jill Levine for a Jewish intro to the topic or Meier for a Catholic one..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is historical evidence that Jesus kept shabbat?  My understanding was that historical evidence that Jesus was a historical figure is tenuous and highly contested; a lot hangs on a little reference to Jesus in Josephus, which everyone agrees was at least partly redacted-- if not completely interpolated-- by the Church.  What makes you so confident of this, Prof Brill-- esp with regard to his keeping the shabbos?  (Hmm.. there is a certain irony in my questioning you on the historicity of Jesus given our previous discussion regarding the historicity of the Torah.  And more generally, I have always found it fascinating that in academic/liberal circles, it is gauche to question the historicity of Jesus [who lived in historical times and should presumably have left clearer traces had he lived and influenced people] on the one hand; but on the other hand, it is gauche to suggest that the Torah&#039;s account of the Exodus might be true.  Seems like a more even-handed approach is warranted...)]]></description>

First, have you read the book?
Second, since he historically remained a shomer shabbat, there are new readings that explain the passage differently. The passage is as far from as clear as you make it.
See the work of Vermes, Saunders, Meier, Dunn and many others of the last few decades. ]]></description>
