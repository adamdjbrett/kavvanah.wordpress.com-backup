					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/synthesis-vs-irreconcilable-modern-orthodox-vs-modern-and-orthodox/#comment-3245&quot;&gt;Yossi&lt;/a&gt;.

One the one hand, struggle, search, while remaining conscious that we may not find an answer that soon. On the other hand, the strength of an ancient system of thought expresses itself also in that area, that there is no need to respond to every latest argument or philosophical trend, for our system provides something of great intrinsic value: stability and continuity.

Over time, the challenges that have shown a measure of staying power need to be addressed, but not every branch thereof. For instance, Biblical Criticism has been around long enough that some more responses are overdue. However, we don need to answer every biblical critic, nor every question raised by the consensus of scholars. What we need is to produce a cogent approach that deals with the issues, and that can be trusted, over time, to respond to enough questions. As a matter of fact, I think that slowly, Mikhlelet Herzog (R&#039;Yoel Bin Nun et al) are doing exactly that, through their literary approach. (It also happens to be very convincing.)

The same can be said for other questions that have been around for a while. But I do not think that we need to respond to works that were produced recently, or that have fallen by the wayside. Forever running after the critics (be they biblical, philosophical of other) is to essentially concede your own insecurity and leave no time over for the beef of your own tradition, of the great gift we should herald to the world through the integer Jewish life.]]></description>

Isaac,
I will reply in greater detail next week, 
But in  he meantime, have you ever read Norman Lamm&#039;s essay Faith and Doubt?  It was a classic and may be the best thing he ever wrote.
Here it is:
http://www.lookstein.org/articles/faithanddoubt.htm
And how do you relate to Izbitzer Rebbe doubt?

					<description><![CDATA[Dr Brill, thanks for engaging me in this conversation! I&#039;m not as well-read as many who post here, but I will do my best to keep up. My opinions have been formed by a brief ten years of work as a Jewish educator and communal professional, and I may say some foolish things, but I appreciate the chance to share ideas.

I think asking what the uncertainty is about misses the point. A great appeal of Orthodox Judaism is freedom from doubt, at least on the big issues. God exists, there&#039;s only one of Him, and the rules for living a good and true life have been revealed by God in both written and oral Torah, and their integrity is maintained by an unassailable transmission process. Whatever religious doubts or uncertainty a person might experience are a personal test. The community does not wrestle with religious doubt - no, its role is to provide chizuk, whether through apologetics, appeal to emotion, embracing victimhood, insularity, ethnic pride, etc. There is no public, communal, non-individual grappling with the key doubts raised by modernity: that the Torah does not appear to have been written by God and given at Sinai 3,300 years ago; that the Mesorah is deeply riven, flawed and unreliable in a plain sense; that science, democracy and freedom - values largely foreign to Jewish tradition - have propelled human well-being and even human morality so far, so fast.

The uncertainty that I think the Orthodox community fails to acknowledge is that we don&#039;t know whether our opinions and beliefs about God&#039;s will correspond with God&#039;s will. Every time we make a choice to permit or forbid, to embrace a modern value or shun it, we&#039;re making an uncertain decision. A rabbi at YCT once told me that people don&#039;t like to fly without wires, without a net. But the reality is that there is no net, and Orthodoxy does its very best to obscure that, to conjure up a net in the minds of its people.

As for what I&#039;m looking for, narrative theology sounds about right, but narrative theology probably needs to be paired with a much more fluid halachic system, or else the story&#039;s meaning may only be constructed to support a foregone halachic conclusion.

I don&#039;t truly hope for complete synthesis. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible. I appreciate the effort though and believe that it can be incredibly fruitful (eg the Rambam). I think we go in cycles of synthesis and antithesis, or redemption and exile, of ideology and confusion. I&#039;m not trying to end the cycle, I&#039;m trying to honor it and contribute to it. I find Wolfson&#039;s exploration and interpretation of the Rebbe&#039;s theology and eschatology fascinating... and I&#039;m equally enraptured by Kearney&#039;s anatheism. Both reflect Jewish reactions to the dominance of the culture of the individual, and if I were to fund a think tank, I would direct it to consider the evolution of Jewish thought, practice and community in response to the skyrocketing stature of the individual.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: apologetic responses being dated, pulpit rabbis needing 20 years to catch up, etc. Isn&#039;t it a feature (a feature, not a bug) of a conservative system such as Orthodoxy, that it waits for the dust to settle, so as to evaluate what needs to be responded to? Many philosophical trends take decades to settle, until we can filter that which has staying power from the ephemeral, all the more so the various social studies. But what are 20-30 years on the scale of the history of Judaism?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Turning this discussion on its head, it seems to me the 1960’s existential angst of the Lonely Man of Faith doesn’t resonate in the least with 21st century Jews.  As Rabbi David Hartman comments in his new book: “I question the importance assigned to the single individual by traditional Judaism.  Fundamentally, Judaism is the way of life of a community and provides someone who seeks to build a spiritual life within the language and structures of community”.

In that context, perhaps the question being debated is as irrelevant as Rav Soloveitchik’s 1960’s struggling existentialism to thinking 21st century Modern Orthodox (and Halachic Independent) post-university Jews?

Perhaps, we are finally recognizing what we always knew before we were told what to think by the Rav -- social man is not superficial; lonely man is solipsistic and requires self-imagined fault lines because he would never join any club that would have him as a member?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isaac-
On social issues, I can see the need to take action. Equality and Diversity are separate topics.  

But on theoretical issues is it also a retreat? If someone in philosophy for example reads Plotinus, Hegel, Habermas, Vattimo, Rorty, and Quine on the graduate level, and does it as someone trained, then they are not waiting for a pulpit rabbi to offer a few mid-brow ideas from something he read. Or if someone is reading anthropology- Boon, Clifford and Appaduri- she is not waiting 2 decades for a rabbi to catch up with the field.  What does “certainty” mean when one is engaged in contemporary fields and is also Orthodox? Are you looking for someone to pasken secular knowledge? 

On Sacred History- Orthodoxy has not risen to historicism even when there are very relevant works by conservative Catholics offering models. 

What is this uncertainty? Uncertain of what? We know what the secular fields say and we know what Torah says.  Above RabbiChaplain says he like the comfort of Orthodox Forum type articles, he like the lectures even if dated and he likes the feel of grappling. Are you looking for Apologetics in the best sense? Or are you looking for a unified theory? Unified theories are harder to come by in our age.

Are you looking for a solid Foundationalist theology?  The  mid-twentieth century ones were existential and did not seek of certainty.Wold you be happy with a narrative theology of story and virtue?

RabbiChaplain like the comfort and aspiration of the attempts and EJ has no need. 
As you mention Hadar and Haredi in the last line as moving forward in opposite directions, but all intellectual synthesis by its nature is static and retrograde because knowledge keeps changing. 

If your had the money and could commission a think tank or articles to confront issues- what would you confront? What would be expected results?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If Hareidi, ahistorical positions are seen as triumphalist, I think some see EJ&#039;s non-synthetic stance as defeatist. Holding two opposite conclusions about when the world was created has few practical implications, and is relatively easy to deal with. But when things get practical, like in the arena of women&#039;s roles, bifurcation turns out to be subjugation of one world-view for the other. I don&#039;t mean to say that Orthodoxy always wins, either. But living in that inconsistent state while having an expectation of certainty and consistency, creates dissonance for some. The idea that this is the best we can hope for is not appealing. And it&#039;s particularly disappointing in the face of values like Truth, or sacred histories of Divine revelation and ongoing explicit guidance (eg the angel and the mechaber).

All I can offer is to suggest that Modern Orthodoxy is challenged by uncertainty. To deal with that uncertainty you can ignore it (the Hareidi approach), or retreat from it (and i see Ej&#039;s compartmentalization as fundamentally a retreat from a battle that cannot be won), or you find the courage to face it and take action. Taking action will necessarily mean producing a society religious culture that is not what MO was yesterday. It means making halachic decisions that upend prior practice. It means embracing the idea of Yiftach B&#039;doro and daring to change - much as Hareidi and Hadar-style Judaism have done, if in opposite directions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking as another &#039;man in the street&#039;, I&#039;m not sure that there is such a strict demarcation between the two camps Prof. Brill mentions. A lot of people (myself included) go for a bit of both. We&#039;re kind of caught between this notion that halacha somehow &#039;binds&#039; us in an objective sense, and the realisation that &#039;God has a history&#039;. So we come up with ad-hoc resolutions when we are challenged on a specific point, but don&#039;t even have a &#039;mishna sedura&#039; in our own minds.

There&#039;s very few human beings who can live a satisfying life whilst believing that the entire structure which governs it lies in a black box which cannot be opened for fear of it disappearing. In the end of the day, there&#039;s either some metaphysical reality behind or it there isn&#039;t. I&#039;m not saying we should give it all up if we decide that the latter is the case, but playing this word game whereby none of these questions matter isn&#039;t going to work outside of the confines of this blog or other rarefied intellectual fora.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you are right about that.  Except that I&#039;m not certain I understand everything they are saying.

I remember reading Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s book on prayer.  When I read the parts about the &quot;depth crisis&quot; that we all have when we confront the fact of our mortality, I thought to myself that I don&#039;t really have such a crisis and I don&#039;t know what the Rav was talking about.  

I think is was AS who wrote that we should just put up an iron divide between our orthodoxy and modernity, get on with life and let our grandkids worry about it.  I like that so I guess I do agree with EJ and AS and we can let it rest at that.]]></description>
