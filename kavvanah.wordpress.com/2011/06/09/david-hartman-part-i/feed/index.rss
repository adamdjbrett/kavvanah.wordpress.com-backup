					<description><![CDATA[The section of the new book I was struck by when I saw it in the bookstore was Chapter 5: Where did Modern Orthodoxy Go Wrong: The Mistaken Halachic Presumptions of Rabbi Soloveitchik.

And picked up in the Jewish Journal review: &quot;Hartman became the Rav’s protégée and, until now, his fierce defender.  [...] Now fourscore years of age, Hartman has written a powerful and painful book. It marks an important break with his great teacher and mentor on a point central to both student and disciple—the history and Halakha. Soloveitchik could encounter history because his philosophy of Halakha insulated him from history and Hartman wants Halakha, especially in Israel, to engage every aspect of history from welfare to warfare, from economics to ecology.&quot;

Amazon delivered my copy of the book today and it is next in my stack.  The only other book of his I have read cover to cover is Living Covenant around the time it was published in hardback.]]></description>
