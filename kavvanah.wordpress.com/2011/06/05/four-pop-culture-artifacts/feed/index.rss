					<description><![CDATA[In terms of weight loss programs, I saw an article in Ami magazine about a group of men in Lakewood who got together and competed with each other in a Biggest Loser style weight loss program.  The founder of this group is now marketing it throughout the community.  Interestingly enough, they even got rabbinic approval to bet on themselves to win.  Pop culture is influencing the lakewood community as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a former NCSYer, most of the content of the new NCSY magazine could have fit in the national NCSY newletter of 1981 -- though we had more people at our Upstate New York shabbatonim than they have today. Skimming through,&lt;em&gt; Ignite&lt;/em&gt; seems to be mixing chapter activities that are fun -- rafting -- and spiritual -- Rosh Hashanah minyanim.

This is not to say that the theology has not shifted. If I get you a vintage shmuez from Raphael Butler or Yitz Rosenbaum, will you analyze it?]]></description>
