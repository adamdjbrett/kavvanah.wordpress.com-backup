I agree with Gil&#039;s maskana. While contemporary usage is going away from hyphens, it hasn&#039;t removed them completely, and it often removes them only after first having them for a while. 

And &quot;half-Shabbos&quot; differs from &quot;shomer negiah&quot; in that: a) the word &quot;half&quot; is often hyphenated (see &quot;half-life&quot;); and b) it&#039;s followed by a proper noun.]]></description>

to be trendy, it would be halfShabbos, which would be a good name for a web site that forwarded text messages with a randomized delay, to make it actually a grama... though my experience with SMS is that there may be a grama delay built in to the network.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i wonder if the teens that are texting are also doing other things as well: eating in non kosher restaurants, computer and tv use on shabbat....
according to my teenage daughter over 70% of her class text on shabbat but most(those that text) also do the other things above as well. is it a general laxity or something else?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to disagree with the comparison of texting to addiction. One of the key components of addiction is that it is controlled by context. It is actually a well documented phenomenon that orthodox smokers are generally able to abstain from smoking on shabbat with little difficulty (Dar et al. 2005; Shiffman, 1991). Which means that when the context contradicts an addictive behavior the addictive behavior is significantly easier to deny. Which leads to one of two conclusions:
1) the context of shabbat (to these teens) does not contradict texting (they don&#039;t see it as a violation)
2) It is not that they are addicted to texting and acting in an out of control way but that they would simply rather txt than keep shabbat. 
My bet is with the second point, I see no reason to call this an addiction and take the responsibility out of their hands.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yitz, I think it&#039;s MO currently growing through a less judgmental period. Another aspect of what I wrote earlier... No one is making them choose between the MO sociological label and their e-communication addiction. Earlier I emphasized this in contrast to chareidim, where they would be forced to choose between communal affiliation and addiction, and quite often addiction will win.

The flaw in my theory is the implication in the story that there are a measurable number of half-Shabbos observant yeshivish kids who also are holding on to communal identity. If I were convinced it was true rather than thrown in as a sop to MO partisans, I would be forced to rethink.]]></description>

two words unless a compound adjective (&quot;half-shabbos observing&quot;). no reason to hyphenate or run together halfshabbos any more than shomernegia.  unless people start to pronounce it as one word, by for example stressing the first syllable over the others. i think most of the one-wordification is with things that otherwise would properly have a hyphen, which half shabbos should not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the spelling, contemporary usage is moving toward removal of hyphens and combining words into one. Therefore, a new term should probably be &quot;Halfshabbos&quot;. However, it seems awkward to me. I would go with hyphenated &quot;Half-Shabbos&quot;. &quot;Half Shabbos&quot; seems to me to imply that they only observe half the time of Shabbos, e.g. Saturday morning and some of Friday night but go to a party or the like after the meals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see half-Shabbos in the terms Mr Shalev is asking about. We are not in the same place we were when mechitzah was an issue.

This is more about kids who want to water down Shabbos and yet aren&#039;t in full rebellion.  I think the contrast is to Kids at Risk, who chafe at the bit and therefore reject the whole thing (at least temporarily) and try to disaffiliate from the community (at least on the overt level). These kids are more loyal to the general message than that. So, I would say it actually has a positive side.

The cause? IMHO, it&#039;s that High Schools don&#039;t try to inspire anymore. &quot;They&#039;ll get fired up in Israel.&quot; &quot;They have NCSY.&quot; I actually have heard a principal slip and say this, but I think as a subconscious thought influencing educational priorities, it&#039;s ubiquitous.Never mind that NCSY, like every charity, is tightening it&#039;s budget and at least in New Jersey are keeping their focus more tightly on their kiruv mission, not less. (And I have that directly from NJ and national NCSY staff.) Israel will fix all.

We created a pendulum adolescence: from the time they get their first cell phone until Israel, they are less religious and less observant than we would like. Then the parents complain about how far they &quot;flip out&quot; in Israel. And eventually the pendulum comes to equilibrium, and they aren&#039;t that far from where they started.

(And that&#039;s assuming your kid isn&#039;t one of those living in the Ben Yehudah Triangle passing around the hookah even at the end of the year...)]]></description>
