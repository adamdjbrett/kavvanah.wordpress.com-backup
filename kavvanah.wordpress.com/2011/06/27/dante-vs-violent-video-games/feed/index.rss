To test your point, what is the explicit or implicit value judgement Tanakh imparts from יהושוע פרק ו:

כא וַיַּחֲרִימוּ, אֶת-כָּל-אֲשֶׁר בָּעִיר, מֵאִישׁ וְעַד-אִשָּׁה, מִנַּעַר וְעַד-זָקֵן; וְעַד שׁוֹר וָשֶׂה וַחֲמוֹר, לְפִי-חָרֶב

While there are other examples, this one translates into threats of violence (if not actual violence) in modern times, by Jews.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kind of agree with him, except ... First of all, the video games are not just violent, but often incorporate a large dose of sexual violence and sexually explicit scenes, that go far beyond anything found in the myths, fairy tales and historical works. That is arguably the worst kind of violence, because if being exposed to violent video games makes people more aggressive, violence in relationships are most likely and therefore most unsettling. Secondly, many of the myths, fairy tales and historical works incorporate explicit or implicit value judgements about the gore, while the video games glorify it.

That said, point one is a bit moot, since the law was apparently only about violence, not sexuality. But the second point is very relevant to teaching the gory parts of Tanakh.]]></description>
