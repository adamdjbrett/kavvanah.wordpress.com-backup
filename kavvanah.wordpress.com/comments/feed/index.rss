					<description><![CDATA[Aryeh was a friend of mind. I worked with him on the area of missionaries and cults and later meditation. I remember being with him as many of his books were published. I stood beside him when he translated Me&#039;am Loez.  I remember reading early versions of Derach Hashem. I remember the shift to meditation in his later years. 
I&#039;ll share one thing Aryeh told me. &quot;You are spending so much of your time on missionaries and cults. You need to study Eastern religions because there are far more Jews there than anywhere else.&quot;
I can&#039;t share all the stories but he had a great sense of humor and a brilliant way of seeing things outside the box.]]></description>
