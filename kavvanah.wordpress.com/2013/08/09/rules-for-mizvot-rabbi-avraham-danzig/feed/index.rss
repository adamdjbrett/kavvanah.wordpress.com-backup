					<description><![CDATA[Jon, 
Thank you for doing the leg work. 
Because of his importance there is literature about him. From Rashi Fuenn&#039;s overview to R. Hayyim Lieberman&#039;s (Rh&quot;l) article on changes between editions, especially the introduction.He did indeed keep changing his works.
Here are two recent articles:
 מאיר, מרדכי 
הרב אברהם דאנציג : מפעלו הספרותי שלא ראה אור. ‬	‫ סידרא יח (תשסג) 41-52 ‬ 
‫ גולדרט, א.י. ‬	‫ על הספר &quot;חיי אדם&quot; ומחברו. ‬	‫ סיני עא (תשלב) 270-293 ‬
He deserves a full dissertation-book. In the meantime, the 1972 article is the best place to start.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking at the first (1809 - online), second (1819 - online), and 9th (1844 - at home) editions, the list was originally a bit shorter.  It started with 23 items, in the 2nd edition he added the 24th (branches of mitzvot), and in the more modern editions (the first two were published before his death in 1820), he added the 25th item, the reward for keeping mitzvot properly. Are there notes as to why he changed things between editions? Do his own copies of his books exist, with annotations?]]></description>
