				<p>Two weeks ago I posted about the <a href="../../../07/28/the-new-haredi-hasidism-zilberstein-erlanger-morgenstern-kluger-and-schwartz/index.html">new Haredi Hasidism – Zilberstein, Erlanger, Morgenstern, Kluger, and Schwartz.</a> For those who want a taste of this new movement there is a new pamphlet put out for Elul 2013 by <a href="http://breslov.org/free-booklet-elul-returning-to-hashem/">Rabbi Chaim Kramer&#8217;s Breslov Research Institute.</a> They are edited to be readable and edit out the original oral style. Here are some selections, read them and let me know what you think. Educators, why do you think people are turning to this?</p>
<p><strong>Elul: Returning to  HaShem</strong> <a href="http://breslov.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TESHUVA-ELUL-KUNTRES.pdf">Here is the pdf.</a><br />
Rabbi Morgenstern works with the Breslov emphasis on prayer and overcoming hindrances. Rabbi Kluger works with the Breslov idea of confession amplifying it into a form of self-therapy in conversation with God.</p>
<p><strong>ENTERING INTO THE AVODAH OF TESHUVA -Yitzchok Myer Morgenstern</strong></p>
<p>Every Jew wants to repent and achieve every good and holy thing, but the moment he looks toward others  around him he falls into doubt.  When we pay too much attention to those around us, we lose our inspiration because living inspired is considered unusual. </p>
<p>a person must instead focus on the holiness of the tzaddikim of his generation, not just his normal acquaintances, and not even just the tzaddikim of his generation but the greatest tzaddikim of all the generations. </p>
<p>Even when a person feels inspired to serve Hashem, nevertheless the sitra achra interrupts him and tries to tempt him away from his purpose with all sorts of nonsense. The person strays blindly after these temptations …</p>
<p>Yet if a person is not sufficiently the master of his own appetites, the sitra achra quickly overwhelms him when he descends to do the avodah that draws him, like a predator rising from the depths. </p>
<p>The main purpose of our existence is to understand and know Hashem wherever we find ourselves. When we do this, we uplift and reveal Hashem’s presence from within the lower worlds<br />
The first step in the process of genuine repentance is simplicity, as Rebbe Nachman said many times. One  must be wary of stoking the heart into a state of burnout, because an overabundance of oil will quench the flame altogether</p>
<p>The most elementary level of approaching dveikus is through the letters of Torah study and prayer themselves, since Hashem enclothes Himself in countless garments until He is actually enclothed by the holy letters that we  can read black on white. Even though this garment is relatively coarse, nevertheless we must begin by seeking  dveikus at this level. We must contemplate them in the manner of accepting upon ourselves the yoke of  heaven—this is the avodah of bearing the yoke of Torah and prayer expressed through the letters.</p>
<p>one can then rise to the next level of feeling love and awe of Hashem. </p>
<p>When one stands to pray, he must forget about everything, and only think of Hashem alone and bind himself to the letters of Hashem’s Torah and prayers. He must forget himself and all that he lacks.<br />
Even so, one must be sure not to jump levels or abandon the path of simplicity, because this provokes the sitra  achra. The Komarna Rebbe taught that true dveikus completely destroys all of the klippos and rectifies one’s  soul through all of its former incarnations going all the way back to Adam HaRishon. </p>
<p>During this month of Elul we must learn to be “experts at running”—to rise to the level of the greatest of  tzaddikim through full repentance—and at the same time we must be “experts at returning”—to move slowly and gradually in accordance with our level, so that the sitra achra does not cause us to fall.</p>
<p><strong>ASERES YEMEI TESHUVAH – A TIME TO REPENT – Avraham Tzvi Kluger</strong><br />
<strong>TESHUVAH FROM WITHIN</strong><br />
Every year during Elul and the Aseres Yemei Teshuvah, we try our best to do teshuvah, to improve in areas in which we are deficient and undertake to do better the next year. Yet often, after the year has passed, we find  ourselves in the same place, trying to correct the same issues we&#8217;d dealt with the previous year.We wonder, &#8220;Where did all my resolutions go? What happened with my sincere teshuvah?&#8221; </p>
<p>True repentance is the rectification of the root of sin. It is tackling the underlying problem, the thoughts and emotions that caused the sin, as it it written, &#8220;The evil one shall abandon his way and the wicked one his thoughts, and he shall return to Hashem, and He shall have mercy on him.&#8221; We must correct the faulty mindset that led us to sin, </p>
<p>sin, is also a result, an external symptom indicating something faulty inside a person. Undertaking to improve one&#8217;s behavior without addressing the underlying  cause of that behavior is like a sick person taking a painkiller instead of healing the illness itself. What we need to change is our general attitude and perspective in life<br />
To repent means to change one&#8217;s inner essence. </p>
<p><strong>RETURNING TO OUR TRUE GOAL</strong><br />
The general root cause of all sin is that a person  forgets his true purpose in life and makes his own desires his purpose.<br />
The cause of sin is that a person forgets the purpose of his creation and becomes caught up in the trivialities of  this world, </p>
<p><strong>CONFESSION </strong><br />
As part of the teshuvah process, we are required to confess and express our repentance in words so that it emanates from the soul into our practical lives; the internal change should become something distinct and tangible that we could indeed put into practice. As we said, there is also a deeper kind of confession, the inner implication of this mitzvah. We can use the power of speech to reveal hidden roots in our soul. </p>
<p>Our holy sefarim extol the importance of intimate and natural conversation with Hashem, in the manner one talks to a  friend. With time, a Jew learns to discern Hashem&#8217;s messages and answers in the form of thoughts that surface in his mind, thus enabling him to conduct a &#8220;conversation&#8221; with the Ribono shel Olam. We need to become accustomed to expressing ourselves naturally and openly to Hashem, even for a few short moments, on a regular, everyday basis and gradually develop a natural, open relationship with the Ribono shel  Olam. </p>
<p>Through this intimate conversation and close connection with Hashem, we will be able to discover deficiencies that we couldn&#8217;t have identified on our own. Unwittingly, people tend to fool themselves, as they are afraid to  face their shortcomings. Acknowledgement of one&#8217;s true situation could lead a person to despair, for he would  think he is undesirable to Hashem in this way, chas veshalom. That&#8217;s why he will try to evade it. But when we maintain a close, regular relationship with Hashem, His closeness and love becomes so clear and tangible to us that even when we become aware of our most severe weaknesses, it is still evident to us that Hashem is with us, </p>
<p>Let us take the example of a woman who is habitually late for candlelighting on erev Shabbos. Somehow, she  always finds herself rushing to complete last-minute chores after the siren signifying the imminent approach of Shabbos has sounded. Even If she resolves firmly to begin ushering in Shabbos on time, she will, in fact, remain with the same mindset and with the same challenge, and it is doubtful that she will be able to keep to her commitment.</p>
<p>The first basic step of her repentance would be to acknowledge and clarify for herself that her true foremost goal in life is to do Hashem&#8217;s will and reveal His honor. This clarity and true desire will help her withstand her challenges. Her priorities have changed; her inner desire has been revealed and her external desires have become less significant. On Erev Shabbos, she will repeatedly remind herself, &#8220;Ribono shel Olam, all I want is to do Your will.&#8221; This will give her the strength she needs to drop some of her expectations and greet Shabbos on time and in a relaxed frame of mind.</p>
<p>If she is accustomed to talking to Hashem, she can try to pinpoint the specific cause of the problem so she can solve the root of the issue. She might find a quiet moment and open up to Hashem: &#8220;Ribono shel Olam, what is  really going on? Why am I always so pressured on Friday and cramming in more and more things to do?&#8221; She  would pause for a moment to allow her thoughts to flow freely, and then express her thoughts: &#8220;What is really pressuring me on Friday?&#8221; After another moment of calm, she will realize, &#8220;I&#8217;m pressured because I want to  make sure I am measuring up as a good and efficient balabusta. I do not like to admit it, but I&#8217;m not really so concerned about kevod Shabbos; it&#8217;s more my perfectionism that drives me. I want the Shabbos meals and the  house to be just so.&#8221; But then she will become aware of inner thoughts that have been concealed even from  herself, and she will express them in words: &#8220;Actually, I can&#8217;t really say that I don&#8217;t care about kevod Shabbos. I do care.</p>
<p>it is a relief to finally have the problem in front of her in plain view. It&#8217;s like having a load taken off her chest. She can now reframe the thoughts that were the root of the problem. She now realizes  that she has to prepare for Shabbos the way Hashem wants. The following Friday, she will easily detect her pressure for perfection and be able to find within herself the true desire to do Hashem&#8217;s will. Now, with Hashem&#8217;s help, she is able to live with the correct mind-set and embracing the right goals. </p>
<p>As a second example, let us take a woman who often feels slighted by a neighbor&#8217;s or sister-in-law&#8217;s attempts to correct her or give her advice about her children&#8217;s chinuch or home-related issues, and finds herself talking lashon hara about them. Resolving not to speak lashon hara will achieve little.<br />
But if she regularly talks to the Ribono shel Olam in a  natural fashion, she will be able to solve the root of the problem together with Him. </p>
<p>She will then &#8220;listen&#8221; to her thoughts and discover deeper levels inside herself: &#8221; I feel she looks down on me, underestimates my skill and understanding &#8211; and I can&#8217;t take that!&#8221; Then, with help of Hashem, she will try to pinpoint the source of the problem: &#8220;I really shouldn&#8217;t care so much what others think about me. You, Ribono shel Olam, know me best, and You know the  truth. What do I care what my neighbor thinks about me?&#8221; With this new awareness, she will be able to change her inner reaction to her neighbor&#8217;s criticism, and thus reach true repentance.</p>
<p>This is an English translation of the chapter Aseres Yemei Teshuvah from the sefer Oscha Avakeish &#8211; taken from the shiurim of Harav Avraham Tzvi Kluger, shlit&#8221;a. The Hebrew sefer was published by Mechon Pe&#8217;eir Yisrael, Beis Hamidrash Nezer Yisrael, Beis Shemesh.</p>
<p><strong>Other Topics</strong><br />
The pamphlet has discussions of Rav Nachman&#8217;s teachings on repentance and a nice write up of the Breslov customs for Elul from Dovid Sears. The essay by Nisson Dovid Kivak, and important Breslov teacher of the aforementioned new Hardi Hasidim was not appropriate for an excerpt. But the pamphlet has a great piece by Rabbi Elazar Mordechai Kenig from Breslov of Tzfat, an important voice of 21st century Breslov. </p>

<p><strong> TESHUVA AND DESIRE –Elazar Mordechai Kenig</strong><br />
The foundation of our Divine service is ratzon/desire. Our ratzon/desire to come close to G-d and to please Him should always be strong. It may be the case that in general we desire to do what G-d asks of us and yet one should know that not all desires are equal. In a matter of a few minutes, we may experience tremendous  differences and distinctions in our ratzon/desire. Nonetheless, the guiding principle is constantly to desire and  yearn for G-d.</p>
<p>Reb Noson says that it is impossible to describe in writing the greatness of our ratzon and yearning to do the  Will of G-d. He explains that the entire reason the soul is compelled to descend from the upper worlds into this physical world is only for the sake of ratzon. Only here can we merit to attain complete and perfect desire for  HaShem and His Torah.</p>
<p>MATERIAL DESIRES<br />
Moreover, without material desires, we would be overwhelmed by our innate desire for G-d &#8211; we wouldn&#8217;t want to be here at all. The desire of the soul to return to her source is so all-consuming that existence within a  body would be impossible even for a short time. Therefore, G-d created us with a need to sustain ourselves  through eating and drinking. This allows the soul to exist in the body, despite its innate and intense desire for  G-d. </p>
<p>THE MITZVOS AND DESIRE<br />
Reb Noson explains that it was out of G-d&#8217;s loving-kindness, that He gave us the 613 mitzvos of the Torah. The mitzvos purposefully involve material things. The essence of every mitzvah is that it is an articulation of the  Creator&#8217;s Will. </p>
<p>Since the 613 mitzvos are an expression of G-d&#8217;s chesed, loving kindness, through their observance we can experience G-d&#8217;s love and desire for us, His people. In this light, we can understand that the Torah and mitzvos were not given in order to make our lives burdensome. Rather, the  opposite is true. We should rejoice in them, since G-d gave them to the Jewish people in order to benefit us. </p>
<p>Therefore, a person needs to be very careful not to fall into selfishness and physical desire. If<br />
he does, he creates a blemish in the Ratzon D&#8217;Kedushah, Holy Desire. This is why it is important to make do with a minimum of material things in this world, in order to prevent blemishing Holy Desire. Through simplicity and wholeheartedness, a person can fulfill G-d&#8217;s Will even through physical things, by using them according to  the laws of the Torah.</p>
<p>Anger, too, flows from one&#8217;s blemished desires. When we are worthy to elevate all our desires to G-d&#8217;s ratzon,  then we live in tranquillity, without anger or jealousy. We know that if G-d wants to give us something, He will  give it; if He gives it to someone else, this, too, is His Desire. With this awareness, we can experience all of the  other person&#8217;s pleasure and happiness without jealousy. Hate, anger, and jealousy all come from blemished  desire.</p>
<p>Even when one stumbles by not acting according to G-d&#8217;s Desire, there is a spiritual remedy: teshuva -repentance, or return. The first step of teshuva is regret. One realizes that he would have been better off if he had not acted a certain way. He acknowledges that he really has no desire for what he did. Through teshuva, a  person can repair anything.</p>
<p>Rebbe Nachman, tells us that it is forbidden to despair. Our misdeeds originated with blemished desire and  now through teshuva and increasing our desire we can actually come to an even stronger desire for G-d. </p>
<p>When a person realizes that this world amounts to nothing, he will not be drawn after  worldly materialism and cravings. Then even whilst feeling very distant from HaShem, it is in this distance, a  person can begin to long and yearn for G-d. Through regret and teshuva, a person has the power to repair all blemishes. </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Once upon a time, Eastern European Jews spoke of Torah and Mizvot, not halakhah. One studies Torah and performs mizvot. The halakhah was in the codes and the mizvah was the performance in the moment. This performance had to have a balance, follow rules, and involve the whole individual. For R. Hayyim of Volozhin, mizvot affected the higher worlds, sustained the cosmos, and were for the sake of God. For Chabad, mizvot were to connect oneself to God.  </p>
<p>In time for Elul, here is a performance list of mizvot written by Rabbi Avraham Danzig (1748-1820), author of the <a href="http://mobile.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Rabbinics/Halakhah/Modern/Orthodox/Hayei_Adam.shtml">Hayyei Adam (Chai Adom)(1804),</a> which was the Lithuanian halakhah work for 150 years. I found a translation <a href="http://www.613etc.com/inside.php?book=rules25&amp;page=1">earlier this year by Reuven Brauner</a> and decided it would be a good post. The translation below was checked against the <a href="http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/hayeiadam/hayeiadam07.pdf">original in siman 68 here,</a> it is based on his but modified when needed.</p>
<p><strong>25 Rules For Performing Mitzvot</strong></p>
<p>1.    ONE MUST NOT PASS OVER A MITZVAH THATCOMES TO YOUR HAND FIRST  TO PERFORM ANOTHER  MITZVAH<br />
One must perform whichever Mitzvoh he comes across first.  One must not leave one Mitzvoh aside to perform another Mitzvoh, even if he intends to perform the first one at a later time.  Certainly, one must not set one Mitzvoh aside to perform another one and not return and do the first. Example:  Although one should put his Tallis on before putting on his Tefillin, if he pulls his Tefillin out of his bag first, he should put them on before his Tallis.</p>
<p>2.    A MITZVAH MUST NOT BE TREATED IN A DISGRACEFL MANNER<br />
This means that:<br />
a)              One should not perform a Mitzvah in a light-headed manner and in a dishonorable way.<br />
b)              One should not be ashamed of or embarrassed about performing a Mitzvah.  Nor should one be concerned about getting his hands dirty.<br />
c)              One should not derive ancillary benefit from the object used performing a Mitzvah while he is performing the Mitzvah.  Thus, one cannot use his Tzitzit while they are attached to the Tallit to tie something.</p>
<p>3.    MITZVOT MUST NOT BE GROUPED TOGETHER<br />
Two Mitzvot must not be performed together as one since he will be unable to perform each one with the same level of attentiveness.<br />
Example:         The same cup of wine should not be used for both Birkas Hamozon and Sheva Brochos.</p>
<p>4.  WHEN IN THE MIDST OF PERFORMING ONE MITZVOH, ONE IS EXEMPT FROM PERFORMING ANOTHER ONE</p>
<p>This is true if any effort must be invested in order to perform the second mitzvah.  But, if no special effort is involved in performing the second mitzvah then, it too, must be done.  The Rambam and the Geonim disagree and say that one is exempt from the second mitzvah even if there is no effort involved in order to perform it.</p>
<p>Example #1:     “Agents of Mitzvoh” (Shilichei Mitzvoh) are exempt from sitting in a Succah,. This applies even at night when they are not traveling, </p>
<p>5.   ONE SHOULD PERFORM MITZVOT IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WAY HE CAN<br />
One should be invested in  every mitzvah with all his strength to perform it in the most pleasant way possible.<br />
 One should always pick the best and choicest object available to perform the mitzvot.</p>
<p>6.   ONE SHOULD PERFORM THE MITZVAH AT THE EARLIEST TIME POSSIBLE</p>
<p>7.   IT IS BETTER TO PERFORM A MITZVAH YOURSELF THAN BY MEANS OF AN AGENT</p>
<p>8.   ONE SHOULD ALWAYS PERFORM THE ENTIRE MITZVOH AND NOT JUST A PORTION OF IT<br />
If one begins a mitzvah, it is he who should complete it.  Chazal have said that a mitzvah is “called by the name” of the one who completes it.</p>
<p> 9.   ONE SHOULD INTENT TO FULFILL ONE’S OBLIGATION AS WE ESTABLISHED “MIZVOT REQUIRE INTENTION (KAVVANAH)”This refers to a Torah Commandment.  However, a Rabbinical Commandment does not require intention to fulfill it.<br />
Someone who performs a mitzvah expressly not to fulfill it, does not fulfill it.<br />
Examples:        One does not fulfill his requirement if he merely read Krias Shma or Remembered Amalek without intent of performing a Mitzvoh.  But, if he blew Shofar (for music), or ate Matzoh (not knowing that it is Pesach), or waved a Lulav and Esrog in the Halochically-correct manner, even without the intent of fulfilling a Mitzvoh, he fulfills the Mitzvoh.<br />
EVEN ACCORDING TO THE ONE WHO SAYS THAT MITZVOT DO NOT REQUIRE INTENTION, THAT IS ONLY FOR AN ACTION BUT FOR A MIZVAH THAT IS ONLY WORDS, EVERYONE AGREES THAT IT NEEDS INTENTION.</p>
<p> 10.  A MITZVAH MUST NOT COME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF A TRANSGRESSION</p>
<p>11.  ANY MITZVAH WHICH CAN BE PERFORMED AS A GROUP WITH OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE DONE WITH OTHERS AND NOT ALONE AS IT SAYS “THE KING’S GLORY IS WITH MULTITUDES “(Proverbs 14:28)</p>
<p>12.  ONE SHOULD PERFORM A MITZVOH METICULOUSLY WITH ALL ITS DETAILS AND PARTICULARS</p>
<p>13.  ONE SHOULD HAVE NO GREATER JOY THAN IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A MITZVAH</p>
<p>14.  ONE SHOULD RUN AFTER AND PURSUE MITZVOT</p>
<p>15.  ONE SHOULD BE EAGER AND ANTICIPATE FOR THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM A MITZVAH</p>
<p>16.  ONE SHOULD PREFERABLY NOT DO A MITZVAH WITHOUT PAYING</p>
<p>17.  ONE SHOULD PERFORM MITZVOHS BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE OF GOD-NOT FOR AN ULTERIER MOTIVE FOR THIS WORLDLY BENEFIT.<br />
He should not perform a mitzvah because he feels obligated to do so and wishes to absolve himself of it, and it is a burden for him.  Rather he should perform the mitzvah out of love.and feel that even if he would not have been commanded to perform it, he would have yearned to do it in order to give pleasure to God.</p>
<p>18.  ONE SHOULD ALSO PERFORM MITZVOT OUT OF AWE<br />
 Even rational Mitzvot, such as Positive Commandments like Charity and Honoring Parents, and Negative Precepts such as Theft and Illicit Relations should not be performed or avoided because one believes they are rational.  Rather, he should perform them because of his fear of the God Who commanded him to observe these matters.</p>
<p>19.  ONE MUST PERFORM A MITZVOT EVEN IF HE HAS TO SPEND A TENTH OF HIS WEALTH </p>
<p>20.  ONE SHOULD PARTICULARLY DO THOSE MITZVOT OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING<br />
If we neglect them, these Mitzvot cry out, “How terrible we must be that we have been forsaken!” and become Accusers against us.</p>
<p>21.  THINGS MAY ASCEND IN HOLINESS, BUT MAY NOT DESCEND FROM HOLINESS<br />
For this reason worn-out “Objects of Holiness” are archived, such as old Mezuzahs, Tefillin and their straps and bags, and certainly Sifrei Torah.  However, “Objects Used for a Mitzvah” must not be used for something ignominious such as using a worn Tallit for some secular purpose.   </p>
<p>22.  A POSITIVE COMMANDMENT DEFERS A NEGATIVE COMMANDMENT, BUT ONE POSITIVE COMMANDMENT DOES NOT DEFER A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMMANDMENT </p>
<p>23.  IT IS FORBIDDEN TO ADD A NEW MITZVAH TO THE EXISTING MITZVOHS<br />
This is only true if one intentionally wishes to “add” a Mitzvah, such as saying that it is a Mitzvah to sit in the Succah on Shemini Atzeres or or if one wears both Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin simultaneously and says that both are Kosher.  However, if one merely sits in the Succah on Shemini Atzeres or eats because of the doubt that this might actually be the Seventh Day or wears both pairs of Tefillin because he is in doubt and says that if one is Kosher then the other is not, it is permitted.</p>
<p>One may not add to a mitzvah, such as adding a fifth string to his Tzitzis or a fifth section to his Tefillin.  Just as it is forbidden to add to the Mitzvot, it is forbidden to subtract from the Mitzvohs, such as making Tzitzis out of three strings or taking only three species on Succos.</p>
<p>24.  LAW OF THE BRANCH<br />
A mitzvah may have a “Branch”, defined as a second mitzvah which should be performed before he performs the first one.  Now, if the Branch does not, post factum, hinder the performance of the first mitzvah, then he should do the Branch mitzvah first, if he can.  But, if he has no possibility of doing the Branch mitzvah first, and since it is not a hindrance to the performance of the first mitzvah, he may perform the first mitzvah straight-away.<br />
 Example:         When bringing a Sacrifice, Semichoh (laying of the hands) must antecede slaughtering, but if it was not done, it will not disqualify the validity of the Sacrifice.</p>
<p>25.  THE ONE WHO PERFORMS MITZVOT PROPERLY WILL KNOW NO EVIL DUE TO THE MITZVAH<br />
One should not do mitzvot hastily and abruptly.  Rather, he should perform them cautiously and with forethought.  One should prepare himself in advance for their performance and not do them hurriedly and in a sudden rush, for one who does so will be unable to perform the mitzvah properly.<br />
That is why we say “Behold I am ready and prepared to do the mizvah”(<em>hineni muchan umezuman</em>). And that why we call the God of Israel not to enter into the mizvah suddenly.</p>
<p>(The capital and lower case usage in this list does not correspond to the block and Rashi script of the original text, unless it made a difference in meaning I left Reuven Brauner&#8217;s eclectic use of large and small cases.- <a href="http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/hayeiadam/hayeiadam07.pdf">see the original here siman 68.</a>)</p>

				<p>I was learning on Shavuot night with a small group in my house and we discussed Rabbi Yosef Karo&#8217;s magid (his angelic or divine visitor)vision in Salonika in 1534. One of the participants who was a former head of psychiatry at a major hospital -think Oliver Sacks type of doctor- said that he has seen this text lead to what he called Shavuot night syndrome. Haredi adolescents who study the &#8220;Holy books (<em>seforim hakedoshim</em>)&#8221; and expect a revelation or a magid or other angelic visitor for their efforts in piety and ascetic theology. Instead, they get anxiety and breakdown, which requires them to come to him as patients. I said we should apply for an NIH to study Shavuot Night syndrome.</p>
<p>A similar phenomena called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_syndrome">Jerusalem Syndrome </a>is found among people who go to Jerusalem and think they are the messiah,a  prophet, or a Biblical figure. There are criteria to use to determine real from pathological, but this makes a case worth looking into. <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_jerusalemsyndrome/all/1">Here is a nice article</a> on the topic. Below is the text responsible for the syndrome, it is also the source for the traditional tikkun to be recited on Shavuot night. Many important rabbinic figures during the period 1500- 1830 including the Vilna Gaon had magidim and heavenly voices.</p>
<p><strong>Shavuot Night in Salonika 1534</strong><br />
Rabbi Shlomo HaLevi Alkabetz- author of Lekha Dodi</p>
<p>The pious one [Rabbi Yosef Karo] and I resolved to make a mighty effort to keep sleep from our eyes on Shavuot night, and not to stop learning for even one second. Thank God we were successful. When you hear what transpired, it will enliven your souls.<br />
For the night of Shavuot, this is the order of study I prepared…. [Verses from Scripture *] All this we did in a spirit of great fear and awe, with melody and trepidation. But what will be told next won&#8217;t be believed.<br />
After all the verses, we recited aloud all the Mishnah&#8217;s of Zera&#8217;im (the first of the Six Orders), and then we started again, learning it in the way of true learning, and we completed two tractates. At that moment, the Creator graced us and we heard a great voice coming from Rabbi Karo, the words unintelligible. The people nearby heard but could not understand. The voice was very pleasing but at the same time was growing continually stronger, and we fell on our faces from the great awe. No one dared to lift his eyes and face to see.</p>
<p>The voice spoke:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunate are you&#8230;because you took it upon yourselves to crown Me… &#8220;Listen my beloved, those who most glorify the Creator, my loved ones, peace to you. Fortunate are you and fortunate are those that bore you. Fortunate are you in This World and fortunate you will be in the World to Come, because you took it upon yourselves to crown Me on this night. It has been many years since my crown has fallen, and there has been no one to comfort Me. I had been cast to the dust embracing the filth, but now you have restored the crown.</p>
<p>Strengthen yourselves my dear ones; forge ahead my beloved; be happy and joyous, and know that you are among the exalted. You merited to be in the King&#8217;s palace. The voice of your Torah and breath of your mouths arose before God and pierced through the surroundings and many firmaments, until the messenger-angels on high were quieted, and the fire-angels hushed and all God&#8217;s lofty army listened to your voices.</p>
<p>I am the Mishna that admonishes mankind. I have come to speak to you. If only there were ten of you, you would have ascended higher. Even so, you have elevated yourselves and those who bore you. You are fortunate, my dear ones, for because of you, sleep passed from the eyes of those who bore you. I have been summoned this night through those gathered in this great and prestigious city. You are not like those lying on their beds, sleeping a sleep that is one-sixtieth of death, besmirching their beds. You bound to the One and have pleased Him. </p>
<p>If you could imagine even one thousandth myriad of my pain, no joy could enter your hearts, no laughter could escape your mouths, considering that on your account I have been cast to the dust. Therefore, strengthen and fortify yourselves my children, my dear ones who glorify Me. Do not halt your efforts, for the thread of kindness is drawn to you, and your Torah is sweet before Him. </p>
<p>Therefore, stand my sons, my dear ones, on your feet and elevate me. With a loud voice, as on Yom Kippur, declare, &#8216;Blessed is the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever.'&#8221; Move to the Land of Israel…Do not value your belongings, for you will partake of the best of the supernal levels&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Standing on our feet, we recited aloud, as bidden. The voice then resumed:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunate are you, my children. Return to your learning and do not stop one minute. Move to the Land of Israel, because not all times are equal, and there is no preventing salvation, whether by much or by a little. Do not value your belongings, for you will partake of the best of the supernal levels.<br />
And if you desire and will obey, the choicest of that land you will consume. Therefore, hurry and travel there for I am the cause that sustains you, and will continue to sustain you. Peace to you in your houses, and peace in all there is to you. Eternal God gives strength to His people and blesses them with peace&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lack of a quorum had imposed a severe limitation, as we were told. They answered that they would afford us this opportunity on the second night (of Shavuot): we would join and be ten. We consented even though we had slept not a wink the first night. </p>
<p>On this occasion, however, the voice did not wait until we started to recite the Mishna. Nor did it wait until midnight (as it had the night before, when it began exactly at midnight), but it made itself heard immediately. As we were reading the verses of Shema, the voice of our cherished one knocked and began, &#8220;Listen my dear ones, those most glorifying God. Arise! And raise those who are lying in dust, through the mystical secret &#8220;of the dust from Above&#8221;. Many matters of wisdom He taught, </p>
<p>After another half an hour, we returned to studying the secrets of Torah. Exactly at midnight, the Voice returned a second time, teaching for over an hour and a half. These matters continued at great length. All who were present, resolved to turn to God with all their might.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>One of the local synagogues posted an announcement recently about Yoga classes in the memory of the deceased, as if Yoga has replaced Torah as a way to raise his soul (<em>le&#8217;ilui nismat</em>). Here again we have popular culture entering unseen and modifying our basic assumptions. It also shows openness to a foreign culture/ another religion that passes under the radar. That yoga is now a practice that one can dedicate the way one dedicates mishnayot is fascinating, syncretism found in the oddest places. </p>
<blockquote><p>Shalom Yoga with BNOT &#8211; Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM sharp in the Bnai Yeshurun Social Hall (Rabbi Steven Pruzansky]. Classes are dedicated to the memory of &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-.</p></blockquote>
<p>American Yoga of the 1950’s was a form of calisthenics desiccated of its Indian origins, the new age brought some of the religion back into it  and now the training of Yoga teachers in ashrams in India-or even MA programs in India- restore yoga to its original context. Any given yoga class can fall anywhere on the spectrum<br />
Recently, the San Diego County Superior Court said, on July, 1, 2013, that kids taught yoga in school would not be aware of the religious elements, so it does not violate religion in a Public School- see <a href="http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/us-judge-rules-against-christians-on-yoga-in-school-22326">here </a>and <a href="http://blog.oup.com/2013/08/is-yoga-religious-encitas-public-school-trial/">here.</a> I assume the synagogue accepts the court’s reasoning.  On the other hand, the Hindu American Foundation <a href="http://www.hafsite.org/Ruling_Encinitas_Affirms_Take_Back_Yoga">while applauding the decision</a> for distinguishing between two types of yoga, as a physical exercise and as a holistic spiritual path. Nevertheless advocates for Hindus in America <a href="http://www.hafsite.org/media/pr/yoga-hindu-origins">to “Take Back Yoga”</a> and generally find these kitschy titles like “Shalom Yoga” to be offensive. As a side point, we are now watching how Hinduism, like Judaism, which declares itself an entire way of life fit itself into the American Protestant concepts of religion. </p>
<p>This topic has come up on this blog several times, <a href="../../../../2010/11/03/yoga-hinduism-and-judaism-again/index.html">One,</a> <a href="../../../../2009/11/18/more-on-spirituality-and-secularization-yoga/index.html">Two,</a> <a href="../../../../2010/11/17/judaism-and-yoga-part-iii/index.html">Three,</a> <a href="../../../../2010/03/11/shlomo-pines-and-yoga/index.html">Medieval </a></p>
<p>And here is the article by Tzvi Freidman that went missing from Chabad.org when the BT&#8217;s went after him.</p>
<p><strong>Is Yoga kosher? By Tzvi Freeman</strong></p>
<p>Question:<br />
Is yoga considered an idolatrous practice because it started out as a Hindu practice? What if one meditates on words of Torah or Psalms while practicing yoga?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
We&#8217;ve been getting this question quite a bit lately, most likely due to all the &#8220;Kosher Yoga&#8221; classes sprouting up.<br />
The short answer is, no it is not prohibited. If it would be, the marathon, too, would be prohibited. So would wine and meat. In fact, so would any benefit from the sun, the moon, the ocean, the wind, fire and air, water and earth&#8211;all would have to be outlawed, since all of these have been either the object or device of pagan worship.</p>
<p>But they are all still kosher. Why? Because, as the Talmud rhetorically asks, &#8220;Because of fools, should we destroy G‑d&#8217;s world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meaning that G‑d put all these things here with a function and a purpose. Unlike the idols and temples erected by idolaters, they were here before Adam was created. It was the mistake of Adam&#8217;s offspring to consider them autonomous beings—but that in no way changes the purpose for which G‑d made them.<br />
The same with Yoga: When G‑d created the human being, He made innate to this creature&#8217;s nature that he would be able to stretch and relax in ways that would provide him greater resilience and mastery over his own body. While the Hellenists were running marathons and the Chinese were developing martial arts, the people in India developed this art of Yoga&#8211;each people according to their particular climate and social structure. It was inevitable that each culture associated these discoveries to their beliefs&#8211;just as they had associated wine and feasting. But because of this, should we outlaw a benefit G‑d placed purposely in His world for us?</p>
<p>Solomon the Wise wrote, &#8220;He made everything fit for its time.&#8221; Everything G‑d put in this world is necessary, nothing is extra. If the benefits of Yoga exist, it means that at some point in time people will need them—for good purposes, for the purposes for which we were created, to bring us and our world closer to our Creator and to an active connection with Him.</p>
<p>The same applies to those forms of meditation that can be useful in developing the mind and in relaxation. All of these must be used, stripped of their association with Hindu deities and the like, for the purpose for which they were originally placed in the world&#8211;to better serve its Creator and know Him in all our ways.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s worthwhile to note that the true Hindu masters recognized that there is truly only a single oneness behind all of reality. Their mistake was principally in their presentation to the common people, allowing them to be misled into worship of literally hundreds of deities. Maimonides discusses this at length in the first chapter of his Laws of Idolatry.)</p>
<p>In Yoga, there are a few postures and sequences that are difficult to strip of their Hindu context. I&#8217;m thinking in particular of a sequence called the &#8220;sun salute.&#8221; None of these are indispensable.<br />
In Transcendental Meditation, a commercialized hodge-podge of Hindu techniques and ideas, the initiated are assigned &#8220;secret&#8221; mantras. These are actually names of Hindu deities and are assigned according to age and gender. A Jew is prohibited from any mention of such names. But again, these can be replaced with kosher chants.</p>
<p>In general, any of these practices to the extreme will be detrimental. They have a place in healing, attuning and empowering the human being. But they must not be made an end in themselves. The Torah teaches us that a soul is sent into this world to act, to create change, to transform the physical reality&#8211;not to escape it. If any of these practices assists you to do so, good. But when they become a means of escape, disassociation or &#8220;transcendence&#8221; of this reality in which we have been placed, they become counter-productive&#8211;and often psychologically hazardous.</p>
<p>You suggested meditating on words of Torah while practicing Yoga. However, much of Yoga practice demands releasing the mind from attachment and focus, while at other times, the focus is directed toward the activity at hand. My suggestion is that you immerse your mind in Torah study before practicing Yoga, so that thoughts of Torah will be ringing around in your mind spontaneously as you practice. The Rebbe gave this advice to someone whose doctor advised him to exercise each day.<br />
Since, as I wrote, many people are asking this question, I hope you don&#8217;t mind if we post this answer for all to read. Undoubtedly, we&#8217;ll get some more suggestions on kosherizing Yoga.</p>
