					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Educators, why do you think people are turning to this?&#039;

Why would people NOT turn to this?  Is it the least bit surprising that people  want some heart and soul into their Judaism?  That people desire meaning and a sense of self?  

I don&#039;t mean that all religious Jews want this, or that chasidic sources have a monopoly on these  desirable qualities.  But it does not take rocket science to realize that mainstream Judaism with its focus on externalities is found wanting in the eyes of many.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Rb Elya Lopian and Rb Yaakov Kaminetsky one should not talk lashon hara about a gentile because you only have one set of middos.

&quot;The most elementary level of approaching dveikus is through the letters ... since Hashem enclothes Himself in countless garments until He is actually enclothed by the holy letters...&quot; - I do not think you will get very far medidating on letters - most people would not find that very meaningful.

&quot;Our holy sefarim extol the importance of intimate and natural conversation with Hashem, in the manner one talks to a friend&quot; - ein hachi nami - we seem to have lost the ability to be angry with Hashem and to argue with Him.

&quot;Let us take the example of a woman who is habitually late for candlelighting on erev Shabbos. Somehow, she always finds herself rushing to complete last-minute chores after the siren signifying the imminent approach of Shabbos has sounded.&quot; - sounds like the same sort of lady who would invite too many people to a party.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Walter,
I still wished you had said something like this is too third hand, too removed, like kissing not through a veil but through an iron mask.
So, I Walter invite everyone to come with me to the Rebbe or to contact me. Or at least to write a 1000 word blog post explaining the position of one of the mashbias. The world is more receptive than you give them credit. Spending light is good for your inner essence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your statement reminds me of something I have thought about many times.
One is not allowed to speak לשון הרע on a Jew but on a non-Jew it is generally allowed. The allegory of לשון הרע given is that of a snake which bites but has no pleasure from biting. The allegory being that even though you can speak לשון הרע on a non-Jew what about the &#039;inner action&#039; that you are still activating in yourself when you do this even though it is permitted?
A &#039;pharisaic weltanschauung&#039;?
Sometimes the &#039;intimacy&#039; one has had with something forces  the sense of justice to override the situation and IMO would go over into the category of הוראת השעה and that is why one sometimes must extract the ארס.
I hear your point clearly and as I stated chose the &#039;letter of the law&#039; point of view.
In addition to this it is a piece of advice for those who wish to thoroughly investigate things and not drink from a כלי שני או שלישי.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My impression is that a great number of comments on this blog are from Americans. I may be wrong and on the other hand a good number maybe  from Israel however not intrinsically involved with any of the communities and with the  שיטות discussed in various posts by the blog owner.
In as much as I have personal and maybe even &#039;intimate&#039; knowledge and experience with a portion of the of the personages mentioned I can attest that things are not what they seem to be and it seems to me like academics 
looking thru a glass darkly into a world foreign to them.
Beyond this anything else would be לשון הרע even though personally I would consider it to be for a constructive purpose.]]></description>
