					<description><![CDATA[This short piece from The New Yorker is good kaparah for some of the self-congratulatory reactions to the anniversary of the march. Money quotes:

Fifty years later, that gulf hasn’t changed much. By some measures it has widened. In 2011, the median income for black households was about fifty-nine per cent of the median income for white households, up slightly from fifty-five per cent in 1967, according to Census data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. But when you consider wealth—that is, everything a family owns, including a home and retirement savings—the difference seems to have grown. Pew found that the median black household had about seven per cent of the wealth of its white counterpart in 2011, down from nine per cent in 1984, when a Census survey first began tracking this sort of data.

&quot;The marchers had ten demands for Congress, at least four of which were aimed at improving black people’s financial circumstances and narrowing the gulf between black and white Americans’ economic opportunities. Fifty years later, that gulf hasn’t changed much. By some measures it has widened.&quot;

&quot;The United States does have policies aimed at building wealth—but those policies happen to disproportionately help people who are already pretty rich. For instance, homeowners claim the mortgage-interest tax deduction only if they itemize their deductions, which higher-income taxpayers are likelier to do, and the deduction gets bigger when you have a larger mortgage or are in a higher tax bracket.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[My wife is from Birmingham, Alabama.  Her grandfather on her father&#039;s side I believe was the first to see the bomb planted in Temple Beth El which was defused before it could go off.  Her mother&#039;s father was in New York buying clothes for his families’ department store when it was announced that 19 Conservative Rabbi&#039;s were heading for Birmingham.  In Birmingham itself there was very little news coverage of the civil rights activists.  The Jews in Birmingham were very against these Rabbis’ coming.  

It turns out that the most racist political leaders in Birmingham, Bull Connor and a couple of his cronies, were voted out of office in April 1963, when the city reorganized its government from a city commission to mayor-council form of government, which resulted in a victory by more conciliatory leadership that didn’t want Birmingham to be a byword for racism.  In some ways, the black leadership needed Bull Connor, they needed these media events to move their political goals forward; Bull Connor needed the black protesters because his goal at the time was to become a candidate for Governor and so he could make a name for himself as a hater, which he did.  

Here is a very good article:  http://www.sjlmag.com/2013/05/bearing-witness-controversial-1963-trip.html.  Sylvan Laufman, mentioned at the beginning of the article, was my wife’s grandfather]]></description>
