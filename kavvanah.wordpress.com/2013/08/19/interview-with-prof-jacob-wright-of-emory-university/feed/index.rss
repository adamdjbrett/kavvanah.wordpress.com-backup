Sorry Prof Brill, but either I&#039;m not up to the task or we are just talking past each other.  (Too bad because, while I really don’t have the time for this, it has been a pleasure and an honor to engage with you, and I’m learning a tremendous amount; thank you).

I don&#039;t see how the Rishonim are out of synch with Potter Stewart.  The issue seems to be ontological, not epistemological.  How do we define/bound/describe an historical event?  I would think that like Stewart, most people operate with some kind of pragmatic approach to this question, and this includes the Rishonim.  I also don&#039;t see how that excerpt from the Kuzari supports your point.  

(It also happens not to be the most strongly argued sugya.  After all, Pharaoh didn&#039;t exactly show signs of recognizing or “revering” the G-d of the Hebrews.   It took ten makot to get him to heel!  And in the next pasuk, he disses Him by increasing Israel’s workload!   [Moreover, the previous two psukim [this is Shmot 5:1-2] have Pharaoh saying he doesn’t recognize Y-K-V-K the G-d of Israel.  I guess maybe HaLevi is saying that since Pharaoh doesn’t challenge Moshe and Aharon when they switch to “G-d of the Hebrews,” this implies that he recognizes *that* name (from Yosef’s days? Though this king’s predecessor didn’t know Yosef!!).  Interesting pshat maybe, but I don’t see the relevance.]]></description>

I guess I am still stuck on your Potter Stewart methodology as not being the Rishonim. They either defined axioms based on a-priori necessity, correspondence to Hazal, a-posteriori inference, polemics, or exegesis.  I dont see the Potter Stewart method in the Rishonim. They certainly did not take the lay person or representational immediacy as their criteria. And i dont see that method used in similar legal cases such as medical ethics. 

Even Rihal does not use Potter Stewart&#039;s  method- see his discussion here. He does not saw that we need to affirm the events as able to return in a time machine. If you formulate Rihal as Potter Stewart then it would be a novel formulation.

19. The Rabbi: If thou wert told that the king of India was an excellent man, commanding admiration, and deserving his high reputation, one whose actions were reflected in the justice which rules his country and the virtuous ways of his subjects, would this bind thee to revere him?

20. Al Khazari: How could this bind me, whilst I am not sure if the justice of the Indian people is natural, and not dependent on their king, or due to the king or both?

21. The Rabbi: But if his messenger came to thee bringing presents which thou knowest to be only procurable in India, and in the royal palace, accompanied by a letter in which it is distinctly stated from whom it comes, and to which are added drugs to cure thy diseases, to preserve thy health, poisons for thy enemies, and other means to fight and kill them without battle, would this make thee beholden to him?

22. Al Khazari: Certainly. For this would remove my former doubt that the Indians have a king. I should also acknowledge that a proof of his power and dominion has reached me.

23. The Rabbi: How wouldst thou, then, if asked, describe him?

24. Al Khazari: In terms about which I am quite clear, and to these I could add others which were at first rather doubtful, but are no longer so.

25. The Rabbi: In this way I answered thy first question. In the same strain spoke Moses to Pharaoh, when he told him:&#039;The God of the Hebrews sent me to thee,&#039; viz. the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For Abraham was well known to the nations, who also knew that the divine spirit was in contact with the patriarchs, cared for them, and performed miracles for them. He did not say: &#039;The God of heaven and earth,&#039; nor &#039;my Creator and thine sent me.&#039; In the same way God commenced His speech to the assembled people of Israel:&#039;I am the God whom you worship, who has led you out of the land of Egypt,&#039; but He did not say:&#039;I am the Creator of the world and your Creator. Now in the same style I spoke to thee, a Prince of the Khazars, when thou didst ask me about my creed. I answered thee as was fitting, and is fitting for the whole of Israel who knew these, things. first from personal experience, and afterwards through uninterrupted tradition, which is equal to the former.]]></description>

Interesting.  But I think you are confusing the two issues I distinguished above and which you agreed were distinct: (a) whether a belief is rooted in history [such that if we could be transported to a particular time and place, it could be verified whether the event took place or not]; and (b) whether we have a warrant for holding a particular belief about history.  What you write about our warrant for believing in (the very fuzzy concept of “the Holocaust”) is separate from whether it is a belief in a historical event.  Clearly, it’s the latter even if it’s bedeviled by the challenge of providing sufficient warrant, esp when we want to uphold “the Holocaust” rather than more concrete events such as whether there was a death camp called Treblinka.

As for how much of 19:16-18 is requisite belief, I can’t say.  I think then we’re back to Potter Stewart’s problem (and may G-d forgive me for the analogy).  There is a description of some kind of mass revelation occurred and a mesorah that it was experienced as such.  The claim is that if we were transported to that time and place, we would experience the same thing and interpret it the same way.  Beyond that, I do not know.

As for drush and the Zohar (is it part of mesorah?  yikes), I think that is debatable.  I would think that we generally maintain the distinction, but hard to say how much consensus there would be on it.  For instance, I think that if we were transported back to Sinai and found that lo and behold, G-d really only said Zachor and not Shamor (and then we found that forty years later, Moshe was really giving a gloss that was geared towards the next generation), this would not be a problem for traditional belief.  Of if we found out that the manna really did not taste like whatever you wanted it to taste like. Or if we found that the Avot did not keep the mitvot.  None of these would be real problems for traditional belief, I shouldn’t think. Etc. Etc.  Put differently, pshat is at the core, drush on the periphery of what is believed to have occurred.]]></description>

The fact that you bring up the Holocaust is a valuable point. In court room trials only the testimony of historians has any value. Survivor memory is seen as tainted, incorrect or a false memory reconstructed later. In trials of  Deborah Lipstadt vs David Irving, it was the historians who were seen as credible, Even in the Eichmann trial, the survivors and Salo Barron were for the drama and show, but the prosecution rested only on the historians. 
The trauma and confused memory of survivors tends to make every prison guard Mengele and to confuse their personal experience with the stories of their friends and from TV. You may want to look at  the Cornell historian Dominick LaCapra&#039;s &quot;Representing the Holocaust&quot; who presents the best articulation of why first hand holocaust stories are trauma narrative and not history. Wiesel and his followers have this theological line that if you were there it was unmistakable, immediate, and inexpressible. Most philosophers, historians, and theologians disagree. Wiesel stresses memory- the need to always remember. But memory is not history- there is a long list of works on this distinction. 

Concerning Sinai, most theological positions emphasize the content of prophecy, not the event. If we are adding to the medieval philosophers, what are the new ikkarim of Sinai?
You dismiss shedim as not peshat, but how much of 19:16-18 is requisite belief? It was not part of their ikkarim but all the rishonim discussed the need for a kavod and for a kol nivra, a created Divine voice. 
On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. 17 Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 18 Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain[b] trembled violently.

How much of the visceral historic claims made by commentors on Wright are peshat? how much traditional drush? how much modern drush? Those who quoted Zohar on this thread, may be more traditional and may need to be part of our definition.]]></description>

Hmm... interesting reply, and again getting out of my range (I haven&#039;t read Crescas, Fisher, or the Zafenet Paanaech) so I apologize that I can&#039;t respond intelligently on them.  However, I will say three things: (a) A rough distinction can be made between pshat and drash.  Last time I checked, shedim and gilgulim are not pshat.  They are out.  (b) That said, it seems to me where we&#039;re getting to a point here where Potter Stewart&#039;s famous line about pornography applies. It is impossible to precisely define an event such that everyone would agree what elements are necessary and what are contingent for us to agree that the event occurred (we can apply a parallel set of questions to yours regarding any event, whose historicity is important to us-- e.g., the Holocaust).  The idea is that if we were there, it would have been unmistakeable.  And the mesorah passes on this experience of unmistakeable experience of God&#039;s intervention. (c) With regard to your last question on legends, I think what matters is, if we could transport the recipient of the transmission to the time and place of the supposed event (were we to know it...), would they experience the event as it has been transmitted to him?   Core Jewish belief is such that it is open to such falsification, however impossible to effect.  (Obviously, this kind of falsification does not provide a strong warrant for belief!  But it does not make the belief less historically-rooted). If that&#039;s what how you&#039;re defining legend  then I guess it&#039;s kosher.  If it&#039;s like King Arthur, then no.]]></description>

<p>Hmm&#8230; interesting reply, and again getting out of my range (I haven&#8217;t read Crescas, Fisher, or the Zafenet Paanaech) so I apologize that I can&#8217;t respond intelligently on them.  However, I will say three things: (a) A rough distinction can be made between pshat and drash.  Last time I checked, shedim and gilgulim are not pshat.  They are out.

Thank you. Now let David Z give a similar statement of his views and we can begin to see what really counts. I believe his version pivoted more on access to God than your answer.

Your distinction between belief in a certain event and the warrant to hold such beliefs is quite useful. We should also however distinguish between a theory of history and the philological/contextual study of history. History for Halevi is providential relationship with the activities of a certain people, not the study of the past. His warrant is indeed the reliable tradition using the Islamic science of  judging the reliability of a text by its tradition (AR. silsila), not philological work. 
Since you were kind enough to respond fully, how about continuing the discussion? R. Hasdai Crescas distinguishes between principles of faith that are a-priori and those that are a-posteriori from Rabbinic literature. An example of the former is prophecy and of the latter the power of teshuvah.  Which statements in this discussion are a-priori and which are a-posteriori? And which are optional beliefs like shedim or gilgul?
What is required for each of the 3 categories? The fire and smoke of Sinai? a transforming event? &quot;let me see wonders from your Torah&quot;? A hidden soul of Torah? black fire on white fire?
In the same Crescas line of thought, notice that he lists the special prophecy of Moshe and not many of the elements that have come up in this discussion. I mention this because Rav Shlomo Fisher of Itri put out an edition of Or Hashem and at the same time does not consider historicity is the a principle, therefore  not having a reaction against historical criticism. 
Finally, in your third paragraph you denigrate legend but what if I ask the question as: how about a distinction between the event and the recording of the event. You can call the remembrance of the event as legend or you can think of it as transmission or &quot;mesorah.&quot; This is why the citation from R. Yosef Tov Elem is playing a role in the discussions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/interview-with-prof-jacob-wright-of-emory-university/#comment-8443&quot;&gt;Alan Brill&lt;/a&gt;.

Interesting reply, Prof. Brill.  If it was bait to hook a fish, I’m happy to be that fish.

Yes, I am assuming something like the Ramban&#039;s position, or that of R. Yehuda Halevi. And many others.  

I don’t see this traditional belief, which sees Judaism as rooted in historical events, as compatible with either a reinterpretation in terms of legends or the attempt to rationalize away supernatural events as natural.   These are simply not the traditional interpretations, they are not pshat*, and amcha rightly regards them as dilutions of what makes our core beliefs compelling. 

(* I find rationalists’ attempts to naturalize miracles to be interesting in that they reflect a recognition that the Torah’s account otherwise rings true.  But it is clearly not pshat that these were natural events.  Benno Jacob has a good discussion of various attempts to rationalize the manna that speak to this.  It is interesting to try and relate the manna to plants growing in the Sinai, but it is definitely not pshat that the manna was natural.  Interestingly, Jacob suggests that the manna was given an ironic name- greeting the initial discovery with “man hu” was meant to record how the Israelites *erroneously* associated the manna with desert plants.  And then they institutionalized the misnomer.  I’m not saying that this interpretation is right, but it’s as good as anyone else’s attempt at exegesis here)

I should note that the question of whether Judaism’s core beliefs are rooted in a belief that certain events actually happened in history is distinct from whether we have a warrant to hold such beliefs. Traditionally, the warrant came from mesorah.  And HaLevi went so far as to argue that the very continuity of this mesorah was self-verifying (Let’s not get into whether this is a good proof or not; my experience is that such debates are all heat and no light because it is very hard to get people to focus on the most compelling formulations of the proof and assess its strengths and weaknesses).  As for those who look to science, I think it’s clear that there is an absence of evidence, but little evidence of absence.  (I’ll note here that Prof Wright’s statements about the lack of widespread writing prior to the early mid first millenium BCE certainly are about absence of evidence, and they rub uneasily with Prof Berman’s demonstration of similarity between the Torah’s covenantal genre and that of Hittite treaties from a much closer time period to the traditional dating of the Exodus.  So let’s just say צריך עיון).  

Another note is that the idea that Judaism does not rest on historical claims also rubs uneasily with the recognition that the Torah can be argued to be a revolutionary document in its linear conception of history rather than the cyclical conception that dominated the ancient near east (and arguably dominated western civilization till the modern period).  (See Sarna, Exploring Exodus, p. 85; http://tinyurl.com/ofjs2gg)  So it&#039;s pretty weird to say that the Judaism does not involve beliefs about history when the Torah is revolutionary in how its emphasis on history!

Finally, I will defer to you with regard to the Rambam.  I would think the yud-gimel ikarim imply a particular belief in history, but of course there are the debates as to whether Rambam actually held by these ikarim or they were just for the masses.  And from my limited knowledge (largely from Micha Goodman&#039;s excellent gloss of the Moreh) accords with your statement that the Rambam does not emphasize history as much as others.

EWZS-
That is exactly what I wanted to put on the table. In order to focus David Z&#039;s question, I wanted to shift the discussion away from the discussion of historical and scholarship and to ask: So David What are you looking for? We have had lots of comments pro/con scholarship. But you now provided what you are looking for: A position like Ramban, that God took us out from Egypt in a way that violated nature and gave self-evident and observable miraculous events that show there is a power over creation. 
But now we are having a different discussion because there are other opinions out there about the Exodus and its miracles, including opinions by Rationalists that would not share your formulation.
Second, what does it mean to be true when you accept it on faith? A Ramban &quot;you shall tell your children of the miracles&quot;? 
That is very different from a Maimonidean halakhah that affirms &quot;that God give prophecy to humans&quot; as a meta-consciousness available even today.
And finally when Prof. Wright says the story was based on &quot;sacred legends&quot; as shown by Gunkel and Noth- where is the problem with a theory of legends? Do you just return to faith?
Prof. Berman is attempting to argue history knowing that there is no way to prove the Exodus, based on philology and historical context. I was asking David Z- what is his argument about since it is not history. Without doing the historical work like Prof. Berman, it is theology-not history. You have answered and shifted to the Ramban.]]></description>

With all due respect, Prof Brill, your comment to David Z is shocking in its not grasping the core issue.  The core issue is whether the generation of the desert had an experience that was *unmistakably* God&#039;s intervening in history (to sanctify Israel as his instrument for bringing His name into the world).  To believe that the Torah&#039;s account is true is emphatically to reject your characterization-- of &quot;a leader of a bunch of slaves taught a set of laws from the mountain.&quot;  Those who were there would not have &quot;need(ed) the requisite faith.&quot;  Their experience (not just Sinai but other miracles like the crossing of the sea and the manna) would have *instilled* it in them (even if they then behaved like bratty children.  Believing that one&#039;s parent can punish them does not make children behave well!).  That these God-helps-man experiences happened in historical time is core to Judaism.  To deny that they happened is to depart from traditional Jewish faith.  (Though to be clear: struggle with one&#039;s belief in these events is only human!)]]></description>
