					<description><![CDATA[Hello! Thanks to all for this thought provoking post!

Can anyone please inform me if David ha-Nagid&#039;s commentary on the Yad contains a full commentary on Hilkhot Teshuvah and if this commentary has been translated partially or entirely into Hebrew or any European languages? Many thanks.]]></description>

The Responsa that Dr. Reif was quoting was addressed to David ben Joshua Maimonides.It was first published 60 years ago by Goitein in this link. 
http://www.htf.cuni.cz/HTF-86-version1-Judaism_a_sufismus.pdf
There has been much more research on Nagid David since then. We know his library, his handwriting, his positions.
For example, earlier this season an new article was published on the Arabic logic he used: &quot;Two commentaries on Najm al-Dīn al-Kātibī’s al-Shamsiyya, copied in the hand of David b. Joshua Maimonides’ (fl. ca. 1335-1410 CE)”by Sabine Schmidtke

Nagid David rebuked him for neglecting his wife and duties but not for the virtues of Sufism. It seems the Rabbinic approach was to moderate the Sufi lifestyle within Rabbinic boundaries. But on the ground, many went off and lived the ascetic life from a young age.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for these. I read &quot;Treatise of the Pool&quot; once, and have used an oriental pool as an image. 
I know Jews who went to Sufi dhikrs here and in Israel in recent generations. I like the creative derivations of zehirut and zerizut.  
&quot;Darwish&quot; as a last name for Mizrahi Jews is something I&#039;d encountered before, and always figured there were Jewish members of such orders up through recent times. Of course, the fact that they became patriarchs of important families underscores the fact that they did have progeny and lived at least a good part of their lives as baale batim, as Judaism as well as Hinduism (and presumably many schools of Islam) demanded. 

Which brings me to my biggest question about this phenomenon: How involved were these types of Sufis in worldly affairs, or how much perishut did Jewish communities tolerate, especially perishut from their wives and communities? I once heard Dr. Stefan Reif, formerly the head of Cambridge U&#039;s Cairo genizah collection, read a geniza fragment in which a Jewish wife complained, presumably to Beit Din, about how her husband abandoned his responsibilities to her to spend time with the Sufis.

So my question is, how ascetic or how hermit-like were these Sufis? Were they wanderers, or did they settle down and meet in a kind of &quot;kloyz&quot; in town? The pictures have a weapon used to defend against highwaymen and dangers of the road, and a bowl, presumably deriving from a time when Sufis, like Hindu and Buddhist ascetics, especially once they had raised their families, wandered and begged for food. But it&#039;s also likely that there were orders which settled down in towns for whom such implements became merely ceremonial. Did the orders attract young idealistic men, the middle-aged who were trusted after age 40, or the elderly empty-nesters who were freed of responsibilities? Was leaving a wife looked upon favorably after fulfilling the householder-stage duties and provided that the wife was provided for? 

Also thanks for the reference elsewhere on your site to Shlomo Pines&#039; translation of AlBiruni&#039;s Arabic version of the Yoga Sutras. I must say that Patanjali filtered through the commentators they used then and through philosophic/mystic Arabic tradition sounds very Sufi-like and very different than the way the Yoga Sutras are translated and understood today.]]></description>
