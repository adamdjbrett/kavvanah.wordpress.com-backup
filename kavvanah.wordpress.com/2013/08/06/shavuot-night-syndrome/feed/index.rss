					<description><![CDATA[PC wrote: &quot;...Rabbi Caro achieved this level of cognisance which therefore reverberated through him and was made accessable to the others present.&quot;

So it seems. But there are a number if issues. One is that the &quot;level of cognisance&quot; of any human (including R. Karo) is certain to very on different occasions, or even minute to minute on the same occasion. If the level of cognisance varies, it is it not likely that the quality of the messages will vary also? But no one, not even the person transmitting the messages, has any way to to evaluate that. In fact the impression given is that all the message is from a unified source.

If, on the other hand, we understand that the building of the vessel to hold the light is entirely our own work, it is also understood that the downflow from  Chochma to Bina is will not exceed what the vessel can hold. That is our own responsibility because it is our own work.

In the R. Karo communications there seems to be an implication that the vessel is not his, but the vessel of the communicator. Perhaps. But you will understand, I hope, if I remain doubtful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would imagine the communication occurs backwards. 

i.e. the &#039;voice being directed at Rabbi Caro&#039; means that Rabbi Caro achieved this level of cognisance which therefore reverberated through him and was made accessable to the others present.

I do not think you would have been able to electronically record the voice. Similar to Avraham&#039;s comment &#039;shevu lachem poh im hachamor&#039; - as the rest of the company could see neither a mountain or the cloud. Hence had you video&#039;d the akeidah it would not have come out.

So it is more indicative of Rabbi Caro&#039;s internal state that being &#039;channeled communication&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[re: “veatem tiheyu li mamleches cohanim ve’goy kadosh”

There is a significant difference between: 1. an apparent challenge, and 2. apparent flattery.

I understand that criticism of such an outstanding rabbi as Yosef Karo should be approached with considerable caution, but I feel very uncomfortable with literature of a type that would be these days be classified as channeled.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[re: &quot;My own reaction would be very suspicious of statements coming from any source, human or magid, that included so much flattery&quot;

I can&#039;t see the difference between this and &quot;veatem tiheyu li mamleches cohanim ve&#039;goy kadosh&quot;

There you go, it&#039;s a proof for Slabodka]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a shame that this man of science can&#039;t have true and simple belief in the metaphysical and supernatural and felt compelled to throw in an underhanded snipe. It&#039;s precisely this attitude that fuels Haredi objections to a normative secular education. This man is spiritually handicapped and no quote from Rav soloveitick can whitewash this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From a very simplistic point of view there is no obligation to remain awake on Shavuot night. It was instituted with the advent of the Zohar which appeared at the end of the 13th century and the expectation of &#039;revelations&#039; seems to be the fruit of the imagination of some which spread to the masses.
As far a &#039;maggidim&#039; go, Maran&#039;s magid may have been his own conciousness/mind? speaking to him as the &#039;revelations&#039; contained therein are of no stupendous importance-&#039;don&#039;t eat beans, etc&#039; באידך גיסא the magid of Nathan of Gaza and the Ramchal revealed some identical secrets to both of them and seeing the consequences IMHO the maggid probably went into retirement or at least occultation.
n.b. yes, I am assuming the the Ramchal and Nathan had the same magid.]]></description>

The Gra just pushed off receiving Torah from the magid, not the rest of the instructions. The Seforim take it literally not as just an inspiration, and it was directly to R. Yosef Karo. Go learn the Sefer Magid Meisharim, which is Karo&#039;s diary of his experiences and what he learned from the visitor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[- I think Rb Wolbe z&quot;l quotes the voice as having come from the Aron Hakodesh, not Maran Beis Yosef

- I was under the impression that the Gr&quot;a rejected angelic intermediaries on the basis that since lo huchshar hador therefore the shvilim were niskalkel and the torah would be krum (Reb Chaim Volozhin).

- Rb Wolbe z&quot;l actually does quote the above maaseh with the aim of inspiring people to greater heights in learning, I don&#039;t think he means that you will hear anything though, just that it is humanly possible]]></description>
