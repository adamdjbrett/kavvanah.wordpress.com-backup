					<description><![CDATA[I seem To recall a graph in the Jewish Week sometime in the 1990s, based on the 1990 NJPS, showing about 22% attrition from Orthodoxy to the other movements or nothing.  That seems to jibe with the figure above of 25% Datlash in Israel]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a nice medrash which says that the reason that Hashem created Avaraham in the middle of the generations is so that he could bear the previous generations and the later generations. This is intruiging, he can bear the later generations by nurturing them and by providing an example, but how can he bear the previous generations?

It seems that every generation transmits an ideal and also a reality of what they were / are. The child bears the previous generation by bearing the gap between the reality that is handed to them and the ideal that is transmitted to them. They resolve the contradiction within their own  lives and thereby make the previous generation feel that they handed down something worthwhile.

In this way the child is the parent of the previous generation. As long as we give our kids the room to be able to do that we will probably be OK most of the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t seen R. Shagar&#039;s book, but I am always a little worried about an analysis of religious Zionism which does not take into account broader - including global - factors.  Does it make a difference that it&#039;s been more than 40 years since the Six Day War and the Messianic process seems to have stalled? What about dramatic technological developments?  Neoliberalism? The rise of fundamentalism? etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is an estimate that about 25% of Religious Zionist kids are Datlash. The numbers are higher in certain settlements and certain anglo-saxon enclaves.

Sorry to bother you with this, but I seem to recall that R. Shagar&#039;s own daughter is something of a Datlashit herself, doing academic work on the topic as well... Is there any truth to this (I might be misremembering from the recent Ma&#039;aleh short film about R. Shagar&#039;s personal legacy)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for mentioning my work Alan. My work relating to datlashim is based on a postdoctoral research that indeed has not been published yet.
My PhD. is actually about Religious Zionist singles and I have published some papers on that subject, here is one in English 
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0048721X.2011.583997#.Uhd6D4bfpjo
and here is a related paper on Orthodox guidebooks to marriage that I wrote with Nurit Novis-Deutsch.
http://www.religjournal.com/articles/article_view.php?id=64
There is actually a connection between the two issues, since often remaining single leads to a move towards dati light. 
I do think that there is an important difference between dati light and datlashim, at least socially, datlashim may have many friends who are datlashim, but they don&#039;t form a social enclave the way Orthodox people do. But I agree that it is interesting how today the Religious Zionist community is embracing datlashim. To some extent this is testimony to the strength of that society, as is the choice made by many datlashim not to completely disengage. 
By the way, a popular work on datlashim was published in Hebrew around a year ago by Poriah Gal-Getz herself a datlashit and incidentally the daughter of the late Rabbi Getz, the rav of the kotel. The name of the book is hadatlashim. I think that her book mainly demonstrates that a new middle space is opening up in Israeli society, that enables Jewish identity that is not Orthodox, I see this as a positive process.

					<description><![CDATA[Dr, Brill it would be advisable to accompany this summary with some longer quotes from the essay.  In particular when you state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For Rav Shagar, the traditionalism was in many ways much better than the Hardal approach. Traditionalism has the soul of a lived religion, a lived chain of tradition. For Rav Shagar, “even though I think we need to keep every detail in the Shulkhan Arukh- it is the traditionalism that is the soul of the Shulkhan Arukh.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

this text begs for more context.   I haven&#039;t read this particular essay (as it wasn&#039;t included in the 2005 edition of the book), but I don&#039;t recall R. Shagar ever writing or speaking in favor of baal habatish.  I&#039;m trying to imagine what was the word for &quot;traditionalism&quot;? &quot;masoret&quot;??  As in &quot;datlashim are seeking masoret&quot;??

Re; Maaleh films.  They used to show them each year during Hol Hamoed.  Mostly they were entertaining, but they were always about adolescent-ish self discovery.  A bunch are here: http://www.youtube.com/user/MaaleVid?feature=watch

Also:   this sentence seems to have a typo: &quot;The datlash has no sense of victory or a new era or triumph; Shagar knows the grass is not completely greener on the secular side. &quot;
