					<description><![CDATA[Jeff,
We now have Maimonides descendents until the end of the 1500&#039;s.
http://tomblock.com/shalom_maimonides

MOSES MAIMONIDES
Abraham (Nagid)
David (Nagid), Obadia (The Treatise of the Pool - Al-Mawala Al Hawdiyya)
Abraham
Moshe (Nagid),Joshua (Nagid)
David (Nagid) 14th-15th century)


ABRAHAM BEN DAVID MAIMUNI (c. 1246–c. 1316), nagid of Egyptian Jewry.
Abraham was the eldest son of R. David, the grandson of Maimonides. During
his father&#039;s old age he shared the position of nagid with him for 10
years. After his father&#039;s death he remained nagid and was successful in
1313 in convincing a large group of Karaites, among whom were some wealthy
men and intellectuals, to return to Rabbanite Judaism.


JOSHUA BEN ABRAHAM MAIMUNI (1310–1355), nagid of Egyptian Jewry who lived
in Cairo. Joshua was the third son of Abraham b. David Maimuni. His
brother Moses was probably nagid of Egyptian Jewry before him. He was a
respected scholar and his responsa on religious and halakhic questions are
quoted by such prominent halakhic authorities of the 16th century as David
b. Solomon ibn Abi Zimra and Joseph Caro. The majority of his extant
responsa were answers to questions asked by the Jews of Yemen. Most of
them deal with the subjects of prayer and ritual. Joshua&#039;s answers are
generally based on the Mishneh Torah of his ancestor Maimonides.


DAVID BEN JOSHUA MAIMUNI (14th–15th century), nagid of Egyptian Jewry.
David was the last of Maimonides&#039; descendants to occupy the position of
nagid. He was a bibliophile who acquired a large library, and he
encouraged the literary activity of others. It was under R. David&#039;s
inspiration that R. Joseph Bonfils wrote his supercommentary Zafenat
Pa&#039;ne&#039;ah (&quot;Revealer of Secrets&quot;) to the commentary of R. Abraham ibn Ezra
on the Torah. R. David wrote an essay in Arabic on the weights and
measures of the Bible. For reasons so far unknown R. David was compelled
to leave for Syria in the 1370s, writing a farewell letter to the Egyptian
communities which is still extant. He lived in Aleppo, Syria, in 1375 and
1379, and also probably for some time in Damascus. During his absence from
Egypt, the position of nagid was occupied by R. Amram, who is mentioned in
1377 and 1380. At the beginning of the 15th century, R. David returned to
Egypt and resumed office as nagid, as is learnt from a document of 1409.]]></description>

Jeff, and IH,
We now have seven generations of the Maimonidian Family and their Sufi, biblical and halakhic writings.
If you never read the Sufi work by Maimonides&#039; son Avraham- you should. Paul Fenton ascribes Treatise of the Pool to Ovadiah, son of Avraham son of Maimonides- definitely go read that.  Fenton translated several other works into French.
We have several other Jewish Sufi tracts from the era.
Jumping ahead, we Jewish -Sufi poetry from Iran and even in mid-twentieth century we have Mekuballim visiting the Sufis.
Go see the chapter on the topic in my book, Judaism and World Religions.
There is lots more in manuscript.]]></description>
