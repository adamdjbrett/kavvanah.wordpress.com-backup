					<description><![CDATA[There is an idea in early Chassidus that the Avos embodied the sefirot while at the same that they were aware of both that fact and of the larger concept of the sefirot and could see the sefirot playing out in their own actions. 

If one wanted to push this idea, there is room to do so.


Unrelated, Embodiment involves an extreme range of possibilities from relatively theologically benign (such as someone acting in a way that is a reflection of a Divine attribute) to extreme concepts of incarnation and embodiment. 

We need a larger Jewish vocabulary of embodiment, including a discussion of gradations and manifestations that could be mapped out over historic and literary examples including Kabbalists, Chassidim, Midrashim, etc. in order to have this conversation in a sophisticated manner..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you saw and liked my Hakirah article.  In researching it, I was surprised to find that the parallels between R. Ishmael and Jaimini had been so little explored.  You may have also noticed that I dropped a footnote referring to the statement by the Israel Chief Rabbinate affirming that Hinduism is not idolatry -- I thought it might be an eye-opener to those who might have felt uncomfortable with my comparison of Jewish and Hindu legal traditions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to my am haaratzus, a thing can only be defined as avodah zarah if yesh bekocho lehara uleheitiv, not if it has supernatural powers of perception alone.

The idea described seems to be more similar to kavod hatorah (e.g. the kavod we give to a sefer torah) than anything else - as we have here a crystallization of Godliness.

In Western terms it seems to be a bit like idolatry of a &#039;script&#039; (as in Transactional Analysis), which is fundamental to script transmission, and does not seem to attract any reprehensibility in Orthodox circles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amit, regarding why jews might look at others, if there exist this phenomenon of human being looking at others, isn&#039;t it part of all of us? (How could it be a human thing but not part of everybody?) Like everything else it has a good sides and bad sides, but it&#039;s nothing to disassociate one&#039;s-self-from and just project out on others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Walter,
You raised a very important pertinent question First ,What is Femenine presence of Divine(Shekhina) mean? Do you understand it?What is Shekhina..and what is the nature of that divinity..why do you call her Queen..if she is non entity..why femenine ? If you understand..Do you know Shekhina is considered bride of Hashem(King).? Now Can you please tell me what is Shakti? 

Shakti : Shakti (Sanskrit pronunciation: [ˈʃʌktɪ]) (Devanagari: शक्ति; from Sanskrit shak, &quot;to be able&quot;), meaning &quot;Power&quot; or &quot;empowerment,&quot; is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe in Hinduism.[1] Shakti is the concept, or personification, of divine feminine creative power, sometimes referred to as &#039;The Great Divine Mother&#039; in Hinduism. On the earthly plane, shakti most actively manifests through female embodiment and creativity/fertility, though it is also present in males in its potential, unmanifest form.[2]
Shakti and Brahman are related to each other like Husband and Wife(Shiva Shakti) symbolically.So can you tell me where is the confusion? 

Now your second question coming to Caste,,,first of all there is no word like Caste in Hinduism.Remember that,
The word we use is &quot;Varna&quot;.Varna was based on mental aptitude.A son of Brahman can be unfit for Brahman work and could be a warrior or could do service for others(Shudra).Sage Valmiki who wrote Ramayana was a Hunter and was born of shudra but he is considered a Brahmin.It was not inherited thing but was corrupted to become a inherited .
So Do not use the word &quot;Caste&quot; ,Use Varna.The people were free to move across varna from Brrahmins to shudra and to shudras to Brahmins but they got caste in stone due to corruption.As for your Brahmin begging for charity,I can see a crooked Jew like Madoff cheating others and yet following Judaism? Do you think it is all right for a Jew to behave like that when the 10 commandments says : Not to steal?
They are social reform movements who try to change it.


Now my most interesting question to you : is why jews are not able to concentrate on their spiritual practices but look to Hinduism/Buddhism - Yoga and meditation./Gurus for their own spiritual growth? Is it due to lack in your system though you claim to have a contract with God at SInai?Follow your own path and do not mix the traditions by being a rolling stone.Why do Jews want to indulge in Hindu practise whether it is Yoga or Meditation ? Can you clarify this deep mystery to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For Jews some aspects of Hinduism are considered &#039;foreign worship&#039; but this is particular to whether Jews can engage in the practice as Jews. 
As far as the Vedanta is concerned it seems quite removed from any &quot;foreign worship&quot; however Shankara himself wrote a least one hymn to a goddess. 
A Brahman can see someone begging for charity in order to eat but will say &#039;that is his karma&#039; and not give. Do you think that the classification of humans, one better than the other is worse than eating meat? I don&#039;t think most Jews would not give charity unless they knew that the person was dubious and even so it would still be considered charity according to Jewish law.
I also read once on Shankara {who was a Brahman} when he came across an untouchable and begin to avoid him realized the absurdity of the systematic classification of Hindus and laughed at himself for even considering that he was better. A good example of &#039;adhyasa&#039;{superimposition}.]]></description>
