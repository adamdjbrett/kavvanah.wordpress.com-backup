To add to the author, and I can&#039;t wait to read his book, some of what i have already read in this field also highlights the differences (e.g. in how we treat menstruant women, which of course is also expressly dealt with in the Pentateuch).  So there&#039;s plenty of room for &quot;eternity.&quot;

To the limited extent that there was direct influence, and its cool to see where it was, there&#039;s nothing wrong with khaza&quot;l taking to heart ezehu khakham or yesh khokhma b&#039;yavan (i.e. goyim).  We are bound to rabbinic law because we lost s&#039;mikha but it is ridiculous to think that if we had s&#039;mikha things wouldn&#039;t change (or that every posek since then absorbs ideas from all the earlier poskim as well as surrounding legal norms when making p&#039;sak).  ]]></description>

Ruvie, I relate directly to these specific questions (and expectations) in the book. I would say it&#039;s a little of both. The Bavli itself (and its Middle Persian equivalent) makes it difficult to point to direct Persian influence. But also more generally, as I responded above, there is rarely anything that you can point to in the world that is entirely a result of direct influence, and direct influence alone. These things are &quot;negotiated&quot; and the process of negotiation can drag on longer than even the negotiation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.]]></description>

Hi Yisrael.  First, I perhaps did not express it so well in the interview, but the book makes it clear that the project of the Iranian Talmud cannot be one that just looks for obvious &quot;Persian looking&quot; things and then gets all excited when these are discovered. The last chapter of the book shows how the Bavli just doesn&#039;t work that way. First of all, it is a second-order text in the sense that it is built on the Mishna and, to a certain extent, Palestinian material. As a result, the method of reading I ultimately suggest is one that tries to appreciate the way older rabbinic texts and statements (&quot;Eternity&quot; in your question) resonated differently (and sometimes changed along the way) in the Bavli, given its context.

I of course don&#039;t deal with theology in the book, and that too brief comment in the interview was originally directed mainly at the yeshiva world. But some of what I discuss in that same final chapter can be formulated into a theological response. Basically, if the twentieth century taught us anything about how language works, it is that meaning is not inherent in language (Benjamin&#039;s &quot;language as such&quot;), rather it is achieved through a complex process in which one particular option is articulated as opposed to infinite others. Put crudely, if the other options didn&#039;t exist then the particular utterance that was made would be meaningless. I think the same is true about Judaism. I guess you could say that I believe, at least from the human perspective, that there is not pure &quot;eternity&quot; to be found. But the eternity of halakha and Judaism, if you subscribe to it, -is-achieved in the course of its transmission, articulation, and being lived in the world. This is hard to put down clearly in a blog post, but when you read the final chapter of the book, my thoughts on the matter should be clearer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alan - thank you for your great intro into the subject matter (as usual on these subjects). its helpful for lay folks like myself who may not know all the background research in the area (on that note can you expand on the difference of approaches/methodologies (if there is any) between geoffry herman and shai?)
Shai - does whatever you see in the bavli tied to persian influences have to be contrasted to how different it is from the yerushalmi (or mishnah) for contrasting what maybe general worldwide influences as oppose to particular ones? have you conclusively shown cause and effect of influences - or casting of middle persian - that shed new light on rabbinic law (more than it &quot;feels like&quot; or &quot;looks like&quot;)? if so, how many instances? if one can show it via greek or roman influences (or its opposite reaction) why shouldn&#039;t persian direct influence not be easily shown?
btw, nice work on du-partzufim.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to sound so provincal, but will there be any scrap of &quot;Eternity&quot; left after every word, phrase, story, concept and law is reduced to borrowings, influence, cultural context etc.? I am afraid Shai glosses too easily over the theological challenges (and yes, i am aware others have tackled them before) around which such academic reductionism inevitably devolves. I am a fan of detail, and historical discovery, but can a paragraph be added about the effects of his research on practical halakhah and/or Rabbinic devotion? Question 3 glosses over too much]]></description>
