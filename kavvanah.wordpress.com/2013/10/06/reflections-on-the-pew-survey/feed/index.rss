					<description><![CDATA[Hi  Alan, 

Great post which raised important issues for further reflection.

 Just a minor correction to your response to Reml. The main essay where  Rav Soloveitchik  discusses the two covenants is  Kol Dodi Dofek. He also touches on this idea  in &quot;Brit Avot&quot;  (in Hamaesh  Derashot) and in &quot;&#039;Iyyunim be-Malkhuyot, Zikhronot, ve-Shofrot&quot; (in Yemei Zikkaron). There are English  translations available of the first two articles. He does not discuss this theme in Al Ahavat ha-Torah.   I discuss Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s view at some length  in my essay &quot;Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Rabbi Joseph  B. Soloveitchik, and Dr. Isaac Breuer on Jewish Identity and the Jewish National Revival&quot; On Jewish Identity in the Post -Modern Age, edited by  Charles Selengut.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Mah ha&#039;avodah hazos lachem&quot; - it would seem that the problem is that the rasha wants to quantify the amount of avodah - &quot;mah&quot; - so he has been kofer be&#039;ikar because he is of the opinion that life is not intrinsically meaningful and open-ended (which does not lend itself to a quantification of the amount of work required).

In other words he has not included his &quot;kol&quot; in the klal (although he is prepared to put in some degree of effort) and therefore &quot;u&#039;lephi shehotzi es atzmo min haklal kaphar beikar&quot;.

The defintion of &quot;kopher&quot; does not depend on the words that come out of their mouth, and conversely the definition of a maamin does not depend on their sworn belief. Hence possibly the odd swirls that appear in the continuity (or lack thereof) of adherence to Judaism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is different in this generation, however, is the intermarriage rate which now approaches 60%, and which has increased with each successive ten year period.  Many of the offspring from these marriages will not be halachic Jews, no matter how they self-identify, and with each succeeding generation of offspring, the chance of them even knowing that they are truly Jewish becomes less and less.  For many of them, their only way back will be a rigorous conversion process if they choose to undertake it.  What a tangled mess we are leaving for the Rabbis just a few generations hence!  I don&#039;t see any way to be optimistic about the Pew study.  The sheer numerical loss of potential Jewish families in America is frightening.  It may be irreversible (certainly the numbers look that way), but these statistics are something that we as a Jewish community, regardless of religious affiliation need to address together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;In Bergen County, as the third lowest intermarriage rate in the country, a non-affiliated Jew is more likely to marry a Jew that an affiliated Jew in a zip code with few Jews&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; In the 1950s, bastions of secular anti-religious Jewish thought such as Commentary Magazine, made the hallmarks of being a Jew to be alienation, outsider pariah status, and to have universal social justice values.&lt;/i&gt;

Frankly, I preferred that state. The last thirty years have seen the rise of a class of Jewish Neoconservatives, whose values, political positions and ideological orientation are at odds with everything I was brought up to perceive Judaism as representing. I find them odious. I have far more in common with a liberal Christian than I do with a Jewish Republican (&quot;religious&quot; or secular).

I liked it better when we didn&#039;t have the keys to the kingdom and, as a group, actually gave a crap about the poor and disenfranchised.

&lt;i&gt;As noted, even Orthodoxy has 22% that claims to have no affiliation.&lt;/i&gt; 

I would imagine those are the ones who deplore the Haredization of Modern Orthodoxy.

&lt;i&gt;Their commitment to the identity politics of their Orthodoxy is a denial of the mission of Israel. Their narrow sense of the Jewish community as limited to their provincial approach is closer to the approach of a Jehovah Witness, who thinks only their small group will be saved in the end of days. These Jews may have assimilated more due to the culture wars by denying a fundamental tenet of Judaism than those with Christmas Trees.&lt;/i&gt;

Thanks for saying this, Alan, Unfortunately, it will fall upon deaf ears.]]></description>

It&#039;s worse than that.  How do we interpret the rise of the Nones?  Chabad is encouraging &quot;just Jewish&quot; identity.  If a large proportion of the Nones actually have a loose relationship to Chabad, Pew is completely missing the boat on where that big growth is going.]]></description>
