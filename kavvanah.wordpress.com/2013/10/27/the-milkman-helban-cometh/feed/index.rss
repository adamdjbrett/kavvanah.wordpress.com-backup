					<description><![CDATA[I think that R Weineberger was brought to RIETS for a wonderful reason-to help talmidim who view Chasidus as a wondererful Hashkafic tool explore the same. Yet, the notion that either Chasidus or Musar can displace Lomdus and breeaking one&#039;s head over a Gemara or Rishon as a means of becoming a Talmid Chacham has always been viewed with skepticism by anyone who  has that aim.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have just started reading the Helban on Bereshit. Based on a few days of reading, I do not think its fair to say that its &quot;rather thin gruel.&quot; To me, it seems like he unpacks cryptic statements of modern Kabbalists like R Kook or the Besht using mostly classical (Zoharic, Ramak, Arizal) sources. It is basic in the sense that it helps you work backwards and see where some of these statements of the &quot;Achronim&quot; are coming from. He also begins with questions that, to me, are more redolent of Modern Orthodox or Dati Leumi parshanut (eg &quot;How can Yaakov love Eisav so much?&quot;) which are more relatable or psychologizing questions on the parsha. The footnotes have helpful excurses for someone beginning to learn kabbalah, eg contrasting the Ramak vs. the Arizal or discussing divergent Kabbalistic shitot to the ones he is explaining. If I were to judge on what I&#039;ve read so far, I&#039;d say that his goal is to get people to engage with the sources more than it is to put forward a single idea or ideology. Its not fair to compare this to R Hutner, who generally writes more in the style of the texts the Helban unpacks and explicates. If anything he wants you to see the seams in a Beshtian statement you might have otherwise just mindlessly repeated. Its a really congenial book and I&#039;d recommend it as a way to ease into Kabbalistic learning and see how Kabbalistic disputes are reprecussive to later authors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Isaacson. I listened to several of his shiurim, and they seem rather mediocre and pedestrian to me. As drush they are so so. And it is this that Rabbi Weinberger will be teaching to Semichah students??? I known I an out-of-date baby boomer,  but  when one compares this  OK  but rather thin gruel  to the rich and meaty  shiurim of the Rav or the Maamarim of Rav Hutner, I just don&#039;t get it.  Let me make it clear, I am not referring to his   segulot and the berakhot, but to the content of his Mahshavah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After listening to some of the material it does not seem very radical or exceedingly creative. I&#039;m wondering what the allure is. 

Whatever the case I&#039;m more perplexed by the fear of Rabbi Weinberger&#039;s influence. Is there really an apprehensiveness that some shiurim from Rav Weinberger will change the nature of how YU&#039;s students view yiddishkeit? I think I heard similar concerns voiced elsewhere a year or two ago when some articles were posted about the presence of chabad at YU events and in the beis medrash. (examples: http://crownheights.info/chabad-news/40352/a-closer-look-at-chabad-life-in-yeshiva-university/ and http://haemtza.blogspot.com/2010/12/modern-orthodox-jews-and-lubavitch.html) 

Is this concern really substantiated?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I miss the milkman we used to have drive down our street in his milk-float every morning, too bad these things are not economical anymore so we will just have to do with our higher standard of living.

I don&#039;t think this is correct:
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B19ZfhqBwHBtblRHM0Q4clh1ckk/edit
The rav writes that the chesed prior to Adam&#039;s creation is greater than that after his creation.

It does not seem that Adam would have got much out of this without the chesed of his own creation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently came across a haskamah written by &#039;the Halban&#039; for a sefer. The book is a new edition of the Leshem&#039;s &quot;She&#039;arim ve-Hakdamot&quot; with comments, punctuation, and summary captions:
http://www.kabbalah-sefer.co.il/-----/249-------.html
(see, in the sample pages, the 3rd page, for his haskamah).
What you say mention in your post regarding a teaching that emphasizes the mishkan seems relevant, as the editor of the book receiving the haskamah, Menahem Makover, seems to have focused mainly on the beit hamikdash in his other work.]]></description>
