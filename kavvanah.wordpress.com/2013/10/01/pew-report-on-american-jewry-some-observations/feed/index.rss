A reference would be helpful, Steve.  The report I read articulated the opposite (pp. 127-128).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have seen many comment on the study and then another person write back that you can&#039;t dismiss Pew.  And I don&#039;t have the kheshek or time to delve into Pew&#039;s methodology for this study (with Sarna&#039;s help), but I agree with those whe say the study shows deep flaws.  The 25% of Ultra-Orthodox  who handle money on shabat that has been mentioned repeatedly should be enough to show that they had major problems in people lying to them about affiliation, not understanding questions, or something else.  Same thing with 15% who attend nonJewish services.  I don&#039;t know anybody who calls themselves Ultra-Orthodox.  No matter how super duper ultra they are.  So how did they get someone to say yes to that?  And where did they find these khasidim?  Did they speak Yiddish?  Where did they find any of these other Jews?  How do you find someone who was born Jewish and has no affiliation, not to mention where they make up a high percentage of respondents.

I even find the 65% of MO going to college bizarre--I&#039;ve not seen anything like that among MO where it seems much higher (closer to 80 or 90), but maybe it&#039;s an older generation.

Look at the end of the day, this information doesn&#039;t impact how I live my life (except to make me even more anxiety-ridden about my parenting), so I&#039;;m not going to be passionate about it.  I&#039;m not triumphalist so i on&#039;t need to be knocked down a peg.  But I find enough things really strange in this study that I am pretty damn skeptical of any of it.  If somebody has any quick links that can show me methodology or why I should trust this study, I&#039;d be appreciate.  Thanks.]]></description>

Sarah wrote &quot;I believe that the surprising results about Orthodox Jews (e.g., 23% do not refrain from handling money on Shabbat, 16% attended non-Jewish religious services at least a few times last year) can be explained by a discrepancy between what we understand Orthodox Jews to be and who identifies themselves as Orthodox Jews. &quot;

 No It can&#039;t be explained that way, it&#039;s off by orders of magnitude. The results have UO handling money on the sabbath 5 percentage points more than MO. MO is a cohort that has a 17 percent non-kosher home,the corresponding percentage for UO is 2 percent. The same goes for attending non-jewish religious services,it&#039;s not a remotely plausible result]]></description>

Alan, you wrote &quot;The survey tolls the end of the triumphalist sense of an Orthodox return.&quot;  I continue to think that if the survey counted as Orthodox only those who are truly observant or who grew up in a home with partents who were truly observant, then the results would show a community that is not experiencing a huge dropout problem.  
My father would be one of those coutned as having grown up in an Orthodox home and then became a Conservative Jew, but in fact his home was not truly Orthodox and he is not really Conservative in his practice.]]></description>

Good point.  I suspect that inherent in the study are multiple self-definitions, based on: belief (in the binding nature of the Torah definition as conferring membership to the nation of Israel), ethnicity--either one or both parents are Jewish, perhaps some non-Jews who believe in Judaism but did not halachically convert, Jews who reject their citizenship in the nation of Israel (as defined by Torah) because they reject the Torah.  Like an American who withdraws his citizenship.]]></description>

I think the UJA data retains some usefulness for those of us outside of the NYC area: the dayschool effect on Jewish engagement is strong, and is likely generalizable for those of us who utilize the system.  One can of course argue that somehow the saturation of Jews in NY makes a difference, and somehow the dayschool effect is not portable, but I think the dayschool effect retains significant independence, since Jewish ethnic saturation does little to retain engagement of the Reform in the NYC area.  

It is possible more orthodox Jews in smaller communities make use of the public school system, which may account for differences in attrition rates/commitment of the children.  Many of the MO in my small community do just that--heterodox dayschool, sometimes not even going to the upper grades, public HS, and secular sleep away college.  Attrition rates appear to be higher with this approach, when I compare with those who do dayschool/yeshivah/seminary all the way through.]]></description>

No, Joe sorry. A demographic study is not ethnography or causality. It is not a study of ideology but of a demographic unit. It is like polling for democrat or republican even though there is wide variance in what those terms mean. They may then ask Which party do you self-identify? are you registered for that party? Did you vote that way? ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sarah Benor -

 when they say Orthodox, they mean they affiliate to an Orthodox synagogue, rather than a definition based on practice or outlook or cultural grouping. .A key responsibility of an researcher doing ethnography (which this really is) is to understand the terms, and establish the dimensions, especially how these terms are understood by both the repondent and their community. If it fails in that, it fails altogether. ]]></description>
