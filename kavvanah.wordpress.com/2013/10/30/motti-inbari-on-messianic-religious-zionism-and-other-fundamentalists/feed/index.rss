					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;They draw more followers from the young generation of religious Zionism that is more moderate. I don’t think their impact on the secular community is very strong. Their growth comes from outreach inside moderate religious circles.&lt;/i&gt;

Interesting, because the blatant kiruv organizations, both in Israel and the US, draw from both populations (more&#039;s the pity).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/motti-inbari-on-messianic-religious-zionism-and-other-fundamentalists/#comment-8943&quot;&gt;Larry Yudelson (@yudel)&lt;/a&gt;.

Dear Larry,
I am sorry for responding late, I saw the post only now. 
There are several differences between the messianic movement of Mrs. Keeth and Gush Emunim. One is the size another is the end expectations. The response to failure is different because in the case of Gush Emunim they can always argue that prophecy didn&#039;t fail yet. 

The increase proselytization in the case of the Gush is directed toward outreach for the secular. There is a big wave of outreach conducted in Israel by several movements, and the settlers is only one of these. In terms of impact, there are about 30,000 people that are consider hard liners. Their numbers grow, due to high population increase. They draw more followers from the young generation of religious Zionism that is more moderate. I don&#039;t think their impact on the secular community is very strong. Their growth comes from outreach inside moderate religious circles. 
I divide Zeal into four categories:  the demand for divine dominion over mundane dominion, the question of violence; radicalization of the religious law; the relationship with eschatology and the pangs of the messiah and the connection with enclave.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The discussion around whether God or politicians are responsible for the perceived negative outcome reminds me a little bit of the discussion at the end of Chassidic Tales of the Holocaust (I think it was that book) concerning whether God or people are responsible for the Holocaust.

Ultimately unless you perceive your status in life (geopolitically or whatever) as part of a greater system it will never make sense and bogy-monsters will continue appearing out of the blue.

Pointing to a book and saying, this is what it says in here so that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about so let&#039;s go and do it - normally does not work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some questions for Dr. Inbari:

1) The messianic group in When Prophecy Fails was a small prophetic cult. The messianism of Gush Emunim grew within the established religious structures of Religious Zionism (e.g.. yeshivas, state-funding, a school system, etc.) Did that difference lead to different responses?

2) Do you have any sense as to the impact of the failure of the prophecy on the numbers of Gush Emunim? Is increased proselytization effective? Does failure lead to a loss of faith among some adherents?

3) Why the switch from nomenclature of fundamentalism to that of zeal? Would you now apply the zeal nomenclature to Gush Emunim?]]></description>
