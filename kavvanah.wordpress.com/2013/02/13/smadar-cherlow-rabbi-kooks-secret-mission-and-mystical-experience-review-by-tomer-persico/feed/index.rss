					<description><![CDATA[I read somewhere, not too clear where, that Rav Kook thought of himself as  the gilgul of Reb Moshe Chaim Luzatto. I don’t know why the Vilna Gaon was so enthusiastic about the Ramchal’s kabbalah seforim, and how exactly some synthesis of the Gaon’s and Ramchal’s ideas  influenced Rabbi Kook’s mystical visions?  I’ve noticed that a fair number of rabbis who were involved in  hastening the coming of mashiach, ended up thinking they were an essential part of the process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The flip side to Yossi&#039;s question is at what point does mystical experience move beyond mystical experience to something that needs to be problematicized as prophecy? That Rav Kook had strong mystical experience is obvious from reading the old English translations. How that fits into the broader picture of 19th and 20th orthodox Judaisms is an interesting question -- I wonder whether either the book under review, or Mirsky&#039;s forthcoming biography, address that question.]]></description>
