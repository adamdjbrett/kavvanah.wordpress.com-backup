Interesting, but the three people I think of who spoke that way (if only sometimes) would not likely have had much contact with R&#039; Lookstein or his students in their childhood:

Julia Child (who used a good deal of butt&#039;her)
My former boss and now co-worker (non-religious Israeli, raised &#038; lives in Queens)
Dad (shed his Brooklyn accent when he went to Juilliard in the 1930s, totally non-religious until, well, most of his life). 

Dad only used that aspirated-T in formal speaking.  We have a tape from the late 1980s, an oral-history interview for the Chicago Symphony, in which he uses the aspirat&#039;hed T, but I don&#039;t remember him using it in normal conversation.  Which validates the authority-figure supposition.  I think my old supervisor would say supp&#039;hose as well.  He, like I, went to Princeton, but I don&#039;t remember people speaking that way there.]]></description>

Excellent analysis. I&#039;d love to see more research on those areas - both historical and contemporary. If you know of anyone who&#039;s interested in this and is considering grad school in linguistics, let me know...

As for #3: yes, there are many similarities between the teshuva process and &quot;flipping out.&quot; Of course people in that situation have much less to learn than people coming from secular or even religious non-Orthodox backgrounds. There&#039;s some mention of this in the song &quot;Flipping Out&#039; by Blue Fringe. I don&#039;t know the answer about rashei yeshiva at YU, but I&#039;d love to hear others&#039; responses to that.]]></description>

Great questions. I see Jewish English as both a connector and a divider. The fact that many Jews share a few dozen Hebrew and Yiddish words that their non-Jewish neighbors do not know serves to unite Jews of diverse backgrounds (including Reform and Orthodox), like bris, bar mitzvah, hamantashen, yortsayt candle, haftorah, etc. But the fact that there are many more words that some use and others don&#039;t - along with major differences in pronunciation - serves to highlight communal boundaries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating work. I have a wish list for some additional and parallel studies and a few musings:

1) A study of the varying linguistic patterns of kollel wives at work vs at home, and those of kollel/yeshiva students entering the workforce.

As an earlier point of comparison you could look at how expats from Orthodox Jewish Brooklyn of the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s by way of professional and grad schools to professional communities outside of NY dropped their Brooklyn accents like hot potatoes (I grew up among this demographic). Even when &quot;talking in learning&quot; there was seldom any Brooklyneese or yeshivishisms.

My armchair research indicates that yeshivish talk (and with it a yeshivish pronunciation of Hebrew based on the polish inflection) arose a generation later. The yeshivas of the 50s and 60s were staffed by Europeans, their students saw themselves as distinctly American. The yeshivish culture only arose later when the yeshivas became staffed with American-raised rabbis who wanted to retreat from the cultural mainstream. 

2) A study of BT communities where BTs make up a large portion of the orthodox population. I particularly wonder about Dallas, where there is already a pronounced difference between locals and newcomers who often integrate southwestern speech to fit in (G.W. Bush being the most famous example). Then you have an influx of NY/NJ rabbis. You end up with this incredible mix of Jews from outside sounding more Texan, Jews from Texas trying to sound more NY Jewish, but the fact that so much of the community is BT means that passing is not as important. I think you might find a very different dynamic at work there. At least those are my speculations from visiting a few times.

3) As I&#039;m sure you know, the same phenomena seen among BTs is found among centrist orthodox who enter the yeshiva world, or attempt to straddle both. Depending on the background they need to drop their day school havara, incorporate yeshvishisms, and learn various forms of shukling and thumb dipping.(By the way, how many rashei yeshiva at YU give shiur with an Israeli-ish havara?) How do they resemble and differ from BTs?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question: What is the role of Jewish English in holding together conflicting Jewish communities divided by space, halachic observance, and ideologies?
