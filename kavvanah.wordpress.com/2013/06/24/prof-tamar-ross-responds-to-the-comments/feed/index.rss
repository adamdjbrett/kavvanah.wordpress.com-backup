Thank you.  According to this theory, how could we differentiate our spiritual legacy fundamentally from other spiritual legacies which have also been highly successful e.g. Islam and Christianity?  If we assume the leaders of these religions achieved divine inspiration, what makes Judaism more compelling?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please can we stop trying to psycho-analyse the social behaviors of those Jews that decide to become more observant?  It is presumptuous and inaccurate.  Bottom line is everyone does it for a different reason.

Prof Ross: As a philosopher, you should at least be this discussing the challenges of the BT on an existential or phenomenological level, and not on the level of dinner-table conversation.
For the record, I am a BT and a post-graduate in philosophy - sorry.
I would be interested to know if Professor Tamar Ross believes the medieval Jewish philosophers, would deem her theory of Sinai as a foundational myth, as heresy?]]></description>

Michael, they don&#039;t let me reply to you (too many digressions, I suppose), so I hope you get this.  I did not mean to suggest it isn&#039;t complex or that the thinking traditional Jew doesn&#039;t need to answer your questions for him or herself (I&#039;ll give a bit on my take in a moment), but just that have-to-do for traditional Jews obviously has to do with G-d&#039;s will and reward and punishment.  And I wasn&#039;t sure why Meir was questioning that.

As to my take.  The khumash just says the leaders of the generation.  khaza&quot;l seem to have understood that takana and even p&#039;sak power to have been limited to rabbis with s&#039;mikha from moshe/y&#039;hoshua.  (I am calling them rabbis because that&#039;s the modern word--obviously that wasn&#039;t always in use.)  So there&#039;s a huge gap between s&#039;mikha and what we&#039;ve got since it ended.  Rabbis nowadays are just working off of what was done before.  There is no power to legislate, although there appears to be a communal power to make new prohibitions binding (perhaps see back to what Meir was saying).  Frustratingly so, in the case of things like kitniyot; less frustratingly for some, in the case of electricity on shabat or monogamy.  But these newer minhagim are necessarily of a lower order than legislation from the rabbis that had that authority.  And sometimes it goes the other way and the community can permit things (business with Trinitarian Christians on their holidays, American turkey).

As for p&#039;sak, once you have identified a makhloket in the biblical and rabbinic law, well you basically use a mix of your own reason, the reason of those you respect and deem wiser than you in the area of tora, and how the community you are a part of acts (see Meir again).  

But there&#039;s no need to get into the nitty-gritty of these things to see a possible answer to your questions.  We believe in a G-d who is merciful and loving when you try to do what&#039;s Right.  This isn&#039;t the Christian god who condemns all nonbelievers to Hell even if they live in the rainforest and have never heard of his only begotten son.

That is, you do your best to figure out what G-d wants and only he can judge you.  If you are sincerely wrong, you will still be judged by that standard.  This isn&#039;t as wishy-washy as it seems.  If you grow up exposed to tora, you have a pretty good idea of what He wants.  If you reject it on the basis of your firm beliefs, it&#039;s going to be up to Him to judge whether you should have known better, whether you knew you were following you yetser hara rather than yetser tov, etc.  I could use less religious terms, but hopefully I&#039;m getting my thoughts across.

Anyway, I&#039;m sure other people have other ideas, but what you can&#039;t break away from is my second sentence above.]]></description>

Right.

There are some pretty well-known philosophical discussions about how the will of God turns into an obligation, but even leaving those aside, I wonder how historically tenable it is to say that God wills the will of the rabbis. (Which rabbis? Just any rabbis? &lt;i&gt;Not any rabbis. You have the follow the rules of tradition.&lt;/i&gt; OK, but where are those rules put forth? What exactly do you have to believe to support this view?)

That&#039;s why I&#039;m not sure how this all works out for traditional Jews. But maybe I&#039;ll all out of whack here, as I&#039;m definitely an amateur in these discussions.]]></description>

It gets grounded for traditional Jews in believing that this is what G-d wants (and what he wants is somewhat mutable, as He tells us to follow the rabbis) and that this i what reward and punishment are predicated on (assuming that you have constructive knowledge of the requirements of halakha).  Did I miss something in your paranthetical?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yossi: The Talmud is for rabbis, NOT for the &quot;Jew-in-the-street.&quot;  That&#039;s essentially the parallel to what you&#039;re saying.  

Yes, Dr Ross writes in an academic idiom, but she presumes she&#039;s writing for equals, who have a similar background, and if they don&#039;t understand a concept, they can go *look it up*.  E.g. &quot;Wittgensteinan language games&quot;.  Or &quot;immanence vs transcendence.&quot;  

So too the Talmud requires a lot of background to understand.  Rashi supplies a lot of that background, but not all of it.  Have you ever tried to read the maamorim of the Lubavitcher rebbes?  They presume a substantial background in kabbalah and chasidus, but were delivered in public lectures, which some understood and some did not.  The goal should be to learn enough to understand.]]></description>

You cite as proof the increased interest in mysticism and spirituality &quot;unmediated by reason...&quot;.   I, for one, can&#039;t make sense of that and I suggest that if you can, then your ideas are not for the common man/woman.   Judaism is not a religion for academics.

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Ross:  
In response to your comment #11 re: baalei teshuva. 
I have also observed that baalei teshuva are attracted primarily to the lifestyle itself rather than to the quality of argument in support of the lifestyle.  But once they’ve arrived, they discover that the Orthodox lifestyle has annoyances and difficulties, like any other; they need some foundation that helps them to sustain the lifestyle despite those warts.  
People born into the practice can depend on childhood memories of the tradition to help provide meaning.  Those who adopt it later in life, can’t.  
Perhaps for this reason baalei teshuva may feel more driven, in comparison with their FFB colleagues, to adopt “objective” arguments.    If so, they may be more likely to find fault in the fluidity of the constructs you describe.]]></description>
