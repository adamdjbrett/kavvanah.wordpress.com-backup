I think you will find the parties falling on the same sides of the fault lines in all these issues.  The issues aren&#039;t so distinct, as they are part of a continuum of concerns to be religiously and culturally addressed.  I also think that the pietistic vs. more &#039;common&#039; inclinations drive much of the schism.  This is only my on sense of things from being part of a community.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: that usage of pop culture &quot;may lead to division in the future.&quot;

There are many factors driving division between segments of Orthodox Jewish society.   I suspect that the lines along which leisure time would divide the Orthodox, are also being drawn by other factors.  

So even if this difference could somehow be resolved, I doubt it would much lessen the divisiveness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding your rhetorical question, &quot;did anyone in Bnei Akiva ask...&quot; - the answer is yes.  Of course they did.  That was a large part of what prompted Shmuel Katz to write K&#039;doshim Tehiyu.  Back then (late 70s, early 80s) there was much discussion about mixed youth groups, activities, etc. in the yeshivah and the community.  Rosh Hayeshivah, Rav Tzvi Yehudah, opposed but tolerated mixed activity, be it in the classroom or youth group.  That was a factor in founding the Noam school.  It was a factor in discussing the propriety of mixed Bnei Akiva branches vs. separate Ezra activities.

Rav Tau has a strong pietistic inclination, and that is in following with Rav Tzvi Yehudah&#039;s personal pietism, and Rav A. Y. Kook&#039;s, too.

I think part of the schism is false.  Traditionally, Mizrahi Zionism was a people&#039;s movement.  It was oriented to the man and woman in the street, the marketplace, the kibbutz and moshav.  The emphasis on piety and scholarship in the yeshivah (very much so in Mercaz Harav) sometimes leads one to forget that for all the preference of piety and scholarship; the Torah was given to create a society.  Sovereign societies are not made up of only, or even primarily, hachamim.  They are made up of people with different abilities, talents, and spiritual achievements.  I am afraid that some, not all, of Rav Kook&#039;s continued following have lost sight of that key notion.  One can argue that masechet damai is a b&#039;diavad; but it is also Hazal&#039;s recognition of the real society that Torah is meant to function in.  The same is true for many other areas of halacha and how Hazal dealt with such dilemnas.  Any rav outside the beit midrash must lead the community that really is out there.

And then of course there simply are honest differences of opinion.  No one can really mistake Rav Hirsch&#039;s path for Rav Kook&#039;s and vice versa.  There is much room for mutual admiration, but Rav Soloveitchik blazed a somewhat different trail than Rav Kook did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are three different strategies here: Rav Tau (as was already pointed out a number of years ago by Rav Benny Lau) has a sectarian understanding of &quot;the chosen&quot; who have to protect pristine Emuni beliefs and practice - regardless of consequences. Rav Ovadyah (as Shlomo Fischer described in an essay) has a &quot;broad church&quot; conception and Shas can attract different levels of religious observance. However, there is absolutely no dialogue between the levels: a Shas supported may go to a soccer game after shul on shabbat, but this will be ignored by his rabbi. Rav Stav is trying valiantly (despite the critique from the left) to build a bridge between the torani concept of halacha and the practices of the broad modern orthodox (dati-leumi) community. If there is alrealy a school for filmaking under dati-leumi auspices - can one ignore the fact that movies are a major part of culture for many observant Jews? Rav Stav refuses to ignore  - and this is what may cost hims becoming Chief Rabbi]]></description>
