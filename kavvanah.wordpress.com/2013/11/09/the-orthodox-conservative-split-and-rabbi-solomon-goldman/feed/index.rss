					<description><![CDATA[Thinking about gehinnom makes me feel warm and cosy on cold winter days.

The Maggid of Kelm would wax lyrical with descriptions thereof. Once some people started laughing at him during one his derashas because of his dramatic descriptions, he reponse was to open the aron hakodesh and say lo lichvodi asisi etc.

I don&#039;t think that Judaism beleives in the absoluteness of I+Y+ (which is what the repudiation of hell seems to be getting at).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Whereas the reward of a mizvah was considered to be the performance of another mizvah now it guaranteed salvation-personal salvation in the world to come…Many a maggid emulated revivalist and evangelist and he cracking fires of hell lent force to many a sterile derasha.(81)&lt;/i&gt;

I don&#039;t understand this statement. &quot;Hell&quot;, in one form or another, has been part of Judaism for centuries. Jews have been brought up with threats of dire postmortem consequences for faithlessness or disobedience; there are lurid descriptions in the Talmud. It&#039;s a theme common to all religions. It was liberal Judaism that put a stop to it.

As far as the phenomenon of the itinerant preacher is concerned, they already had them in the old country generations earlier. It had become such an accepted part of their lives that Singer inserted it into his stories. I suspect a lot of it was due to the influence of Hasidism, but you would know more about that than I.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/the-orthodox-conservative-split-and-rabbi-solomon-goldman/#comment-9006&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;.

Rakefet cites one case from 1933 where Revel asked someone to leave in a specific situation and they did not. He does not give many details except that it also had a mixed choir. It was also a few years after the Goldman case. Revel had no problem having Goldman as featured speaker. From the recent scholarship on the early Conservative rabbis, we see that Revel still tried to keep them on his team. It should not be globalized without going through the class roster, several of who had mixed pulpits or were no longer following the Shulkhan Arukh. In addition, if they already had ordination from Rav Moshe Soloveitchik or JTS, it did not matter. And Rabbi Belkin certainly did not have that policy.]]></description>
