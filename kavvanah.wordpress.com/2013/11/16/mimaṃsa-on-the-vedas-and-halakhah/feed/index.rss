Do you mean the idea of God hiding His face? The idea of God&#039;s absence? (Have you read Francis X Clooney&#039;s &quot;His Hiding Place is Darkness&quot;? It is excellent. I am curious what you might think of it). Or do you mean the concept of Eyn Sof in Jewish Mysticism? Or the idea of the upper most of the ten sefirot being removed and detached in comparison with the tenth sefira, that which kisses the earthly realm? And when you refer to God&#039;s personal side--as opposed to Brahman--are you referring to the facets of God that are expressed in names of supposed gods, which are really manifestations of various attributes of Brahman in his proximate mode?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a follower of Sri Vaishnavam, a Vedic/Mimamsa based religion dating back to the 10th through 12th centuries.  Its preeminent teacher, Sri Ramanuja taught of a God Who is both Personal and Impersonal.   His Personal side is expressed in historic texts, myths, and poems as appearing in Avatara, but His Non-Qualitative Side serves as the Brahman, the solution to the Universe and its existence.

I think this as close as we can find to the &quot;God Far, God Near&quot; approach which is spoken of in popular Jewish thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I heartily agree, Alan, when you write that it &quot;is important to recognize especially from where we sit, that there is a Hindu Orthodoxy who biggest concern is that the rules are followed and not to saddle them with ancient beliefs even if a practice continues.&quot; 
I have been fascinated by my studies with Francis Clooney for over two years now. Our very first semester together was an in depth study of Mimamsa, and as a Halakhist, my mind began to explode with religio-legal comparative ponderings. I have been studying Dharmasastra from an intense religio-legal focus ever since. Thank you for posting and sorry for being AWOL due to a particularly grueling doctoral semester! Excited to be part of the conversation!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2 questions: [1] it seems to me that the Vedas are more consistent than &quot;the rabbis&quot; if only because they do a more consistent job in bracketing out the referent or signified, focusing solely and purely on the sign-act itself. or is there a Vedic theology that i&#039;m not understanding. and a related question. [2] what often strikes me about the Bavli is the intense interest in material things (like stones, walls, animals, internal bodily viscera. are the Vedas like that also?]]></description>

Ira- for your first part you are correct. Davis had a pilpul in the Rambam that I did not reproduce. The second part I need to think about. But there is important to recognize especially from where we sit, that there is a Hindu Orthodoxy who biggest concern is that the rules are followed and not to saddle them with ancient beliefs even if a practice continues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could think of other Jewish thinkers who would be a better Jewish comparison for Purva Mimamsa understandings of Dharmashastra for Davis: Isaac Arama, perhaps the Vilna Gaon,Yeshayahu Leibovitz. This is more similar to mitzvot as gezerot, without any ta&#039;amim, mitva leshem mitzva. Islam probably has even better comparisons in terms of submission to the pure will of God. But none of these completely takes God out of the picture the way Mimamsa can. Rav Soloveitchik is just too Maimonidean and hence committed to taamei hamitzvot and virtue. Davis does seems right about Torah/Veda being mediated by rules/traditions/Church/Oral Law, but isn&#039;t that the Rav&#039;s adapatation of Karl Barth&#039;s Church Dogmatics and isn&#039;t that likely to be claimed by any orthodoxy?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Where do the Seers receive this eternal truth from according to the Mimasa? OK there is no god, but it seems there is an assumption of a non material reality. It would be interesting to hear how they see these interprenetrating..it seems perhaps similar to a Platonic approach..or even if they dont see it quite like Schopenhauer, is his idea of will something close to how they see it...would be interesting to know more]]></description>
