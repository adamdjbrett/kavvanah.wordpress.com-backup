That is not the fair or correct song to pick.
The question should be about Harrison&#039;s Within you and Without you
or compare Harrison&#039;s &lt;em&gt;All Things Must Pass&lt;/em&gt; to chabad influenced Peter Himmelman&#039;s &lt;em&gt;All these Inpermanent Things&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A significant aspect of Judaism seems to be the idea of pesak. I.e. it is possible to come to a conclusion at a point in time that a person is either chayav or zakai. Once this pesak is reached, future treatment of that person will revolve around the decision reached at that point in time.

This seems to be the total opposite of the Beetles style mentality where no action of a person can ever determine categorically the way that they will be treated in the future.

Not to say that Judaism treats people in a legalistic manner, but that life is broken down into discrete elements of mini-life, each of which leads to different outcomes in the sequential next.

I.e. Moshe Rabbeinu did not believe in strawberry fields forever.]]></description>
