					<description><![CDATA[A few observations on a very interesting post:
1. Sai Baba did not author this piece. Let&#039;s not imagine for a moment that he read through these intros to Judaism and synthesized them. Someone did it. This is what a reasonable outsider&#039;s view of Judaism would be, based on reading introductory works. I see little ideology or misunderstanding. It&#039;s a kind of cut and paste job that is meaningless in and of itself. Its real meaning lies in the question of who is behind it. I did not succeed in getting deeper into this website. My question is not whether Sai authored this. Rather, was it done under his instruction at all. This is taken from a US site of his organization. It is likely that once Sai makes a pronouncement on the unity of  religions, his disciples will go out and produce this kind of document, especially as there is criticism that Judaism has been left out. And it may well have been composed by a Jewish person. So, I would love to know more about this document and specifically if there is any meaningful link to Sai himself.
2. What this post shows us is how little contact with real Judaism there is and how Judaism is known only from books. So there are two tracks for leaning about Judaism - Christian refractions of it and various intro works that reflect it in one way or the other through the tools of comparative religion. So I would ask if we could classify these approaches in light of this distinction. 
Clearly Radhakrishnan is beholden to a Christian view.
It is hard to know whether Dasgupta is just giving us an intelligent man&#039;s impression of the bible or if it has protestant overtones. His reference to Durkheim does suggest influence of seconeary reading. With Vivekananda also hard to know. Also seems like a mixture of both. But whatever it is, reading is always limited to the Hebrew bible. there is no trace of any other text that informs the 3 earlier authors. Only the recent (American) depiction of Judaism has better information, but has no direction or substance. Its meaning is provided only by being part of a series of unity of religions, not by the actual substance of the survey.]]></description>

No, you may not deduce. They give a number of about 90%  or higher as already monotheists. And some of that exception is specifically those those are elite but hold other views.Those holding an elite non-monotheist position tend to push the numbers lower. Shall I open the Hamodia and find passages of superstition and imply that most Orthodox Jews are still un-ready for monotheism? You are falling back into the trap of the golden calf as proving contemporary statistics of Jewish worshipers of the golden calf. 
Here read the standard introductory work

					<description><![CDATA[Your account of Sai Baba shows that it is well worth it to clarify and teach what our beliefs are. Over time, he begins to have a more well developed understanding of what we really are about. He still only bases himself on very general, very brief texts, but then again, most of us don&#039;t know more about most other major religions, either.

I find the following blurb particularly fascinating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hindu thinkers, while they themselves practiced a very high ideal, understood the un-readiness of the people for it and so took to careful tending instead of wild forcing. They admitted the lower gods, whom the masses ignorantly worshipped and urged that they were all subordinate to the One Supreme”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

May we deduce that those Hindus who see themselves as ultimately monotheists really are just the elite, while the popular understanding of Hinduism, perhaps even with parts of the elite, are still on that level of &quot;un-readiness&quot; for the &quot;high ideal&quot; of monotheism?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“The similarities between the names Abraham and Brahma have not gone unnoticed. Abraham is said to be the father of the Jews, and Brahma, as the first created being, is often seen as the father of mankind. Abraham’s name is derived from the two Semitic words ab meaning ‘father’ and raam/raham meaning ‘of the exalted…’ We might also note that the name of Brahma’s consort Sarasvati seems to resonate with that of Abraham’s wife, Sarah [also note the confusion surrounding each one&#039;s identity as a wife and/or sister]. Also, in India, the Sarasvati River includes a tributary known as the Ghaggar. Another tributary of the same river is called Hakra. According to Jewish tradition, Hagar was Sarah’s maidservant. There are other connections. Both Brahmins (a word that is connected with ‘Brahma’) and the Jews see themselves as the ‘chosen people of God.’ The Hebrews began their sojourn through history as a ‘kingdom of priests’ (Exodus 19:6). Likewise, Brahmins are also a community of priests” (Steven Rosen, Essential Hinduism, p.12).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/some-modern-hindu-approaches-to-judaism/#comment-9055&quot;&gt;tillerofthesoil&lt;/a&gt;.

Hindus do not derive their heritage from Abraham but from earlier than that.They are called Sapta rishis...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saptarishi

The Saptarishi (from saptarṣi, a Sanskrit dvigu meaning &quot;seven sages&quot;) are the seven rishis who are extolled at many places in the Vedas and Hindu literature. The Vedic Samhitas never actually enumerate these rishis by name, though later Vedic texts such as the Brahmanas and Upanisads do so. They are regarded in the Vedas as the patriarchs of the Vedic religion. The Big Dipper asterism is also called Saptarshi.
The earliest list of the Seven Rishis is given by Jaiminiya Brahmana 2.218-221: Vashista, Bharadvaja, Jamadagni, Gautama, Atri, Visvamitra, and Agastya, followed by Brihadaranyaka Upanisad 2.2.6 with a slightly different list: Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashiṣṭa and Kaśyapa, and Atri. The late Gopatha Brāhmana 1.2.8 has Vashiṣṭa, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Gautama, Bharadvāja, Gungu, Agastya, and Kaśyapa.
In post-Vedic texts, different lists appear; some of these rishis were recognized as the &#039;mind born sons&#039; (Sanskrit: manasa putra) of Brahma, the representation of the Supreme Being as Creator. Other representations are Mahesha or Shiva as the Destroyer and Vishnu as the Preserver. Since these seven rishis were also among the primary eight rishis, who were considered to be the ancestors of the Gotras of Brahmins, the birth of these rishis was mythicized.]]></description>
