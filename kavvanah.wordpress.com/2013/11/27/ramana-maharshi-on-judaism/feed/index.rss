					<description><![CDATA[In this entire discussion of I am that i am, i think we are missing one important component of the Hindu read of Ex. 3,14. it is highlighting the word THAT.. The typical, and almost universal vedantic (not at all exclusive to Ramana) reading is I am THAT,, suggesting union of the person with the ultimate. Therefore, there are two issues at stake - am vs. will be and their overread of the THAT of the translation]]></description>

Ira,
I think you have it correct. They can say they have primitive elements only because of lack of education but once the primitive get educated then they will be elevated.Judaism on the other hand, enjoys its bronze age and early primitive so that they will never fade.
On comparative relegation, this January they are having their first conference of the newly formed Indian academy of Religion. The historic and comparative have generally not been their approach.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Where to begin? Well, in teaching Torah or Judaism, I always try to preface that I am always giving my interpretation, what I see as central. That having been said, what I find central is Judaism&#039;s particular combination of &quot;refined&quot; thought, legal, philosophical, or mystical, with its &quot;organic&quot; connection to the more primitive religious notions of the past. 

I cannot help but see your Hindu students of today as following what is a very &quot;refined&quot; religion. Our Judaism by contrast cannot but appear to them as rather &quot;primitive,&quot; closer to many aspects of ancient &quot;tribal&quot; religion. But they may be able to appreciate that there is a positive side to our less-refined  &quot;primitive&quot; holdovers, in that Judaism may be more holistic and organic. What do I mean by this, what would I emphasize? Well, there&#039;s always Max Kadushin, z&quot;l and his &quot;Organic Thinking, but there is a more basic approach. 

Our conception of salvation is salvation of the nation as a whole, and the individual finds his salvation as a part of the Jewish People as a whole. Their salvation is individual release. Our God is the God of the Abrahamic and the Israelite family/tribe/nation/kingdom. God is king/general , as well as head of the family. He can demand a degree of  exclusive loyalty and worship because of that. God himself is not purely the En-Sof; his having a personality and being a personal God is due to His being a Living Organism Himself. The covenant with Adam and with Noah failed, and God began again by having an organic connection with a family. Hayyim Vital wrote that emanation/creation which proceeded by logical speculative means lead to shevirat ha-kelim, and the emanation/creation begins again with Abba and Imma. Our Shehitat Hullin tradition is intimately connected to the old sacrificial tradition; Masekhet Hullin is part of the Order of Qodashim. Hindus have elements of tribal religion in their past, as well, but they have evolved differently. 

They may be able to appreciate the way the two religions have kept a continuity with the &quot;primitive&quot; past of &quot;tribal religion&quot; in different ways, and appreciate the different paths taken in what was preserved and kept as well as what ended up being lost. 

I appreciate Hinduism&#039;s emphasis on the spiritual development of the individual Soul/Self. But I also appreciate more Judaism&#039;s emphasis that the religious life means much more than the spiritual development of the individual; that the Self, even the Greater Self, must often be sacrificed to the welfare of the society at large. That emphasis upon society over the individual also explains why we emphasize objective truth over subjective truth. 

But are historical and comparative approaches to religion completely anathema to orthodox Hindus? You mentioned Mircea Eliade. Do Hindus today read him? Have they any general education in Western comparative religion?
Sorry to write so much, but you asked some big questions

Moshe understood the chok of Parah Adumah so he knew the secret of life that King Shlomo was unable to conceive of (amarti echkemah vehi rechokah mimeni). This seems to be along the same lines as Rabbi Chaim Volozhin&#039;s comment in Ruach haChaim on the mishna in Avot of moshe kibbel torah misinai where he says that the reason there is no pesik between the two names of Moshe when he was called &#039;Moshe Moshe&#039; at the burning bush is because he knew of no hephsek between the element of his neshama that came to olam hazeh and the element of ones neshama that remains in olam habah (as opposed to Avraham where there is a pessik between &#039;Avraham Avraham&#039; at the akeidah).

So he knew Hashem mitzad olam habah as well (asher yodao yud-keh-vav-keh, olam habah beyud and olam hazeh with the heh), but this still only relates to a  level of knowledge that corresponds to Moshe&#039;s completeness, not to ein sof.]]></description>
