Also, plenty in the domain of higher criticism is not hypothetical. Are parallel ANE texts, differences between parallel accounts within the Torah, differences in sentence structure, word usage, appearance of cognates, and the like hypothetical? (is archaeology hypothetical?) Ok, so what you make of them relies on theory, but then again, lower criticism is also theory-laden. If the hyperliteralist view of the Rambam’s eighth iqqar has epistemic priority for you then you will offer all sorts of alternative theories to account for these variations. If Torah mi-Sinai has epistemic priority for you then you can offer alternatives as well. If I trot out a Rashi or Ramban that deals with a textual discrepancy addressed in higher criticism does this kasher higher crit?

It is easy enough to draw a line at the point where it is theologically comfortable for you. But that&#039;s all it is, a reflection of where you feel comfortable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could we please learn to separate the issues of so-called higher criticism from lower criticism in these discussions? The hyperliteralist view of the Rambam&#039;s eighth iqqar is simply not defensible (and see R. Yaakov Weinberg&#039;s Fundamentals and faith: insights into the Rambam&#039;s 13 principles for a concession on that score if you need one). This is one of the errors that Halivni made in his treatment of Torah shebikhtav; he doesn&#039;t distinguish between lower criticism, which at times is grounded in fact, and higher criticism which remains &quot;hypothetical.&quot; Discussions of &quot;lower criticism&quot; are found in Rashi, Tosafot, R. Hai Gaon, R. Akiva Eiger, Rashba etc., with a variety of opinions being put forth on how to relate to apparently variant citations from the Bible in Hazal. &quot;Higher criticism&quot; contradicts the notion of Torah mi-Sinai; &quot;lower criticism&quot; does not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nothing &quot;biblical&quot; in the Bible?  Well, let&#039;s see.  In the Mesopotamian flood account, when the hero disembarks from the ark, the gods work double-overtime to find ways to limit human re-production, so that mankind won&#039;t disturb the gods by making too much noise.  And when Noah dismebarks the ark in the (uninspiring simple reading of) Bible, God says &quot;be fruitful and multiply.&quot;  That&#039;s pretty &quot;biblical&quot; to me, and it&#039;s long before the Hellenistic era. In fact, it makes me &quot;feel good.&quot;]]></description>

I guess I may have misremembered. Prof. Kugel does write (p.687): &quot;...it seems to me that the whole matter of Scripture&#039;s inspiration can only be understood in connection with the overall change in Israel&#039;s apprehension of God...Rather, as some rabbinic texts themselves intimate, it [Divine inspiration] all has to do with the great, single revelation that inaugurated (and on which was predicated) Israel&#039;s changed apprehension of God.&quot; And as he also writes on his website, in answer to a reader, &quot;What really underlies everything -- and what was the ongoing substance of the Sinai revelation -- was the revelation of a new way of being connected to God.&quot;
He also suggests that this changed apprehension occurred in the closing centuries BCE. (&quot;..one is left with the conclusion that most of what makes the Bible biblical is not inherent in its texts, but emerges only when one reads them in a certain way, a way that came into full flower in the closing centuries BCE.&quot; p. 668. &quot;It is really the wisdom mind-set that made so many ancient texts into Scripture.&quot; p.671)
In any event, in light of Prof. Kugel&#039;s acknowledgement of the human initiative involved in this &quot;changed apprehension&quot; (&quot;at a certain point in this history...Israel began to conceive of a different sort of &quot;standing up close&quot;, p.683), it&#039;s curious that he is so hostile to the &quot;human response to the ineffable Divine&quot; formulation. Even if we are talking about reinterpretation, and not revelation, here, Prof. Kugel does nevertheless maintain that &quot;frankly, we don&#039;t really seem to (sic) all that aware of, or even care much about, where the dividing-line falls.&quot; (answer to a reader on his website). And also that the (re)interpretation is more important than the words themselves (p. 685).
Anyhow, my original question was just that I&#039;m curious to know to what extent this change was influenced by cosmopolitan cultural influences.
One last suggestive quote from the Professor: &quot;All of these texts underwent a radical change in meaning...The original meaning of these texts disappeared. In a sense, ancient intepreters rewrote every one of them, even though they did not change a word.&quot; p.518]]></description>

Anon - i don&#039;t think Kugel equates reinterpretation with revelation. He has stated many times that he believes in a &quot;handoff&quot; between God and the jewish people. what and when is always sketchy - my opinion. while the reinterpretation takes place around the time of wisdom literature he also states that coincides with viewing the entire pentateuch as solely a work authored by God( first seen in jubilees chap. 11)- also ascribed to the text hidden prophetic meanings. again, it has nothing to do with revelation but the ancient interpretators creating the &quot;biblical&quot;.
&quot;...wisdom mentality seems to have exercised a profound influence on how the bible was perceived in late biblical times.&quot; p.671 also reread the last 2 paragraphs of the book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If Midrash is how Jews understand Scripture -- then doesn&#039;t Kugel&#039;s enterprise of providing historicist literary origins to Midrash undercut that reading? Isn&#039;t there a profound difference between understanding the Torah through Midrashic lens, and understanding Midrash through Kugel&#039;s lens?

In other words, having declared that Midrash is the true Jewish meaning of scriptures, doesn&#039;t Kugel replicate all the problems of the Documentary Hypothesis by doing scholarship on Midrash?]]></description>
