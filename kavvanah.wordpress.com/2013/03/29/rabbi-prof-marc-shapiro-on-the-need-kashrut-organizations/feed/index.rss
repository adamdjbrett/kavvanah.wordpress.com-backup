					<description><![CDATA[For &#039;natural&#039; or &#039;artificial&#039; flavors the most that you would be concerned about is a meat or shellfish derivative. 
Grape products are batel b&#039;shesh, as per the Shulchan Aruch.
For the vast majority of flavors for most industries it is extremely unlikely (mi&#039;ut sheaino matzuy) that they use a meat or shellfish derivative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another point worth noting is that R. Henkin, in his collected writings, states (contrary to R. Abadi) that if you have a product under hashgachah and one not under hashgachah, that you must buy the one under hashgachah so you can also fulfill the viewpoint of Rashba. In other words, according to R. Henkin in the U.S. where you can basically find equivalent products with hashgachot for every item, one must buy the one with hashgachah. But if you are in a country without hashgachot on products, then one isn&#039;t bound by the Rashba&#039;s view (and with the exception of Israel, there is no supervision like we have in the U.S. anywhere else in the world) .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eric,
     Anything that improves the taste is listed on the label (and it could fall into the nebulous &quot;natural flavors&quot;). Trace ingredients add nothing to the taste and therefore do not need to be mentioned. They are incidental as they are part of other ingredients, and are not added to improve the taste. R. Abadi holds that you don&#039;t have to be concerned with natural flavors. Pretty much everyone disagrees with him in this matter.]]></description>
