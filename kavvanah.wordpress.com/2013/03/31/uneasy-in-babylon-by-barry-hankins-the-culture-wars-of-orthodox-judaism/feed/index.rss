					<description><![CDATA[After the Six Day War it was clear that secularism and   Zionism was successful in filling the needs of the Jewish people for security and economic development. What was religion’s role? You wanted a livelihood, go to college. You wanted safety, learn how to fight. Each group in Orthodoxy was pushed to justify its existence. From one end the militant Gush Emunim offered their  particular grandiose  religious- nationalist solutions for bringing  the Messiah &#038; redeeming the world. They were a huge success, leaving the rest of MO with their limited ideals of  TuM and Torah im Derech Eretz as smaller, less noble people aiming for a decent job and a life in the suburbs.  

From the other end the charedim were expanding quickly, each group offering the certainty of being authentically Jewish, and with it a total identity. MO without charismatic rebbes or a network of advanced yeshivot, bais yaakov’s &#038; neighborhoods was hard pressed to meet the challenge. MO in recent decades is a result of this pincer movement. It has  become part of the right wing support for the occupation, a me-too enthusiasm for pan-halachacism, a yearning for gedolim they can call their own. The residual liberal rump has been reduced to obsessive criticism of charedim, feminist issues in synagogue ritual, and crusades for the protection of minors from abuse. No group in MO has been  willing to identify openly and courageously with contemporary versions of modernism and secular culture because the rules of engagement reward frumkeit, moralism and intense Jewishness. 
 
In the case of the conservative churches, the situation as I imagine it was quite different. There was no internal competition who can  be the frumest of them all. There was the trauma of the 60’s sexual revolution, the rise of non-white communities with their own values, and a general feeling that secular humanism was destroying the moral fabric of America. Jewish neo-conservatives like Kristol, Podhoretz and Krauthammer took up these anti liberal crusades, but the effect on the religious community was minor in comparison to the effects of the charedim and settlers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/uneasy-in-babylon-by-barry-hankins-the-culture-wars-of-orthodox-judaism/#comment-7665&quot;&gt;Yonatan K.&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;I don’t think that Modern Orthodoxy was more engaged by American Culture during the 1990′s than previously.&lt;/em&gt;

During the earlier period of MO, the ideal for some was rabbi dr. speaking to HS graduates. (Boston and Maimo were exceptions). The self-perception of Jewish Action magazine was of non-college educated. Most baby-boomers were first generation college, shop keeper family.  By the 1990&#039;s it was  a broad engagement with culture. 

I think both books offer insights. MO is not identical to any Evangelical phenomenon; the books offer insights each highlighting a different aspect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have thought about the parallels to Modern Orthodoxy over the years since i read Uneasy in Babylon several years back. The author himself notes most religions move to the left so the SBC move is significant and therefore the parallel to Modern Orthodoxy is striking.
 
However, the reason why the SBC moved to the right is because of the growth and industrialization of the South throughout the post-war 20th Century, which brought about confrontations with American Culture which the Northern Baptists experienced in the earlier twentieth century leading to the Mainline/Fundamentalist breaks in the 1920&#039;s. 

The same cannot be said about the Orthodox &#039;move to the right&#039;. 

I don&#039;t think that Modern Orthodoxy was more engaged by American Culture during the 1990&#039;s than previously.

A stronger parallel is the rise of Fundamentalism and the Fundamentalist/Evangelical alliance described in &quot;The Book of Jerry Falwell&quot;, where the lines between Fundamentalist and Evangelical were blurred in the 1980&#039;s, similiar to the lines between &#039;Yeshivish/Chareidi&#039; and &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot;.]]></description>
