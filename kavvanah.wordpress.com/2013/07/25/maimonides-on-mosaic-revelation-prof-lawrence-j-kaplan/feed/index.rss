					<description><![CDATA[Just a couple of observations/comments:

Both approaches make Moses, the historic figure central for Maimonides. Moses is the prophet/legislator/philosopher/leader par excellence. Much of the current discussion denies such a proposition.

Does Professor Kaplan accept all of Maimonides metaphysical assumptions which presuppose his esoteric position? If one denies his metaphysical assumptions can one still sustain that position.

The above read of the esoteric position of Maimonides assumes that Moses&#039; excellent skills governing the people are revealed in his legislative skills in the laws of the Torah. However, one could also argue that Moses governing skills were his ability to take the Israelites from Egypt and to lead the people in the desert for 40 year, independent of the written words of the Torah. This would also be consistent with Maimonides&#039; position about the true philosopher/prophet/leader and his leadership skills.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dovid Shlomo,
That letter is not taken as authentic. So no contradiction. And I am not sure you read the intro to Yosef Bonfils commentary.
Read this article available online, it will give you the start of an approach.

					<description><![CDATA[Rambam is said to have praised peirush Ibn Ezra in a letter to his son, urging him to study it and -- I have heard -- compared Ibn Ezra to Avraham Avinu.

In his introduction to Tzafnas Poneach, Rav Yosef Tov Ellem describes the germination of the work: He wrote it at the urging of a Chacham in Damascus, who wanted that there be a work that explains Ibn  Ezra and would demonstrate that he was not an apikorus.

Tzafnas Poneach identifies this Chacham -- and he turns out to be a ben achar ben of the Rambam.

Question: How does one reconcile this with a narrow reading of Rambam&#039;s eighth principle, which would seem to classify Ibn Ezra as, someone who has no share in the world to come? Surely, the Rambam would not be championing such a person to his son, nor would there seemingly be within Rambam&#039;s family such a close affinity with Ibn Ezra&#039;s commentary.

I can think of twp possibilities, but am curious to hear what Prof Kaplan has to say.]]></description>
