I was not asked in the original questions. There are starting questions for the speakers and they are usually provincial and with begged premises. It would be fun to do.
I am doing another one for next year and when I asked about including your categories one and three, they answered that they are flying in experts for #3 so dont cover Israel and #1 is not my mandate from the organizers. So it goes...]]></description>
