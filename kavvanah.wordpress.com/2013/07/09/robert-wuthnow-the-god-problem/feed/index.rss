					<description><![CDATA[In reading this piece a few thoughts come to mind.
1.  Many of the posts on this blog have a focus on language and linguistics in relation to how culture continuously develops.  What I wonder is whether culture drives the language we use or whether the language used in society ends up defining the culture we experience?  
2.  I think Wuthnow&#039;s arguments about our audiences is highly crucial to understanding much of society today.  I know that the language I use and the arguments I present are often different depending on my audience.  And this is not because I don&#039;t believe what I am saying but rather it is how my audience would perceive my ideas.
3.  This leads me into thinking about Tisha B&#039;Av.  The language of the day in most Orthodox synagogues includes G-d punishing the people for their sins, Sinat Chinam, etc.  In a Post Holocaust world that works hard not to define tragedy as being a result of our sins, does the rhetoric of the day lose meaning and remain merely the words that seem most appropriate to say?   For many teachers who speak of tragedy, we say those things in the context of the moment but also would not say the same in the private presence of someone who suffers.  I am always struggling with this in working with the elderly Holocaust survivors.  We work hard to mask the ideologies of the past in memorializing a day that is defined for all tragedy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Does item 5 mean that sociology of religion still has some use for Douglas&#039;s application of Bernstein&#039;s theory of restricted and elaborated speech codes?
Are social theorists using Douglas at all to understand contemporary religion? She seemed to have been pushing back against the notion that a rationalized theologically explicated religion was somehow better.

2) Do you think that halakhic/religious language and prayer is so linguistically and conceptually distinct for English speakers that it makes it easier to compartmentalize the two codes? (I used to listen to a lot of evangelical talk radio -which is admittedly not representative-and was always struck by the fluidity with which religious concepts enter regular language compared with what I am used to). Are modern Orthodox Jews in America dualists in sociolinguistic terms?

3) Any sense about the lack of religious identity in mass produced popular culture. There are plenty of shows involving the supernatural, but they are not religious or are religious only in the Mitch Albom sense. Does this, more than political discourse, project the sense of what is reasonable? 

4) Regarding &quot;norms of reasonableness.&quot; Why is it reasonable to publicly oppose abortion rights on religious grounds and unreasonable to show up at work tell your colleagues that you almost got into a car accident but Jesus took the wheel and steered you to safety? It&#039;s more reasonable to use faith to justify restricting other people&#039;s personal liberty than it is to express gratitude for what you feel is a personal miracle? We tell people that faith is a personal matter but are uncomfortable with them expressing it in immanent personal terms, at the same time we publicly respect the institutionalized dogma of recognized faith communities.

Is it really as simple as claiming that religion is recognized as a reasonable evaluative but not explanatory framework? Is this partly a consequence of the dominant religion in the US being one that lacks a religious metaphysics that supervenes on the physical world? Perhaps this is just a joke, but the idea that kosher is taken to mean blessed seems to reflect this. The idea that some food has metaphysical properties causally related to its physical properties seems foreign to mainstream Protestantism. Once the physical world is disenchanted religion can only explain what I value?]]></description>

Thank you. Understood that they speak some of the language of tradition. Would you agree that according to the research if you catalogued their actual beliefs, cut through the six means etc., I don&#039;t mean in an argumentative way or by asking them about tradition, but through an independent analysis of their actual beliefs regarding how the world works and regarding religion, then you would find that they essentially do not hold the traditional religious views.]]></description>

Shaya,- the cultural approach is one of the many approaches of late modernity that you are calling &quot;post-modern.&quot; A modernist when confronted that religion is irrational would attempt to prove that it is rational or say your right it is not scientific rationality rather about a personal existential truth. A cultural approach asks is it rational? and instead of proving rationality dissolves the question into what Charles Taylor calls our &quot;immanent frame&quot; of meanings and moral orders.]]></description>

They think they are the tradition, they represent the mesorah. They speak the supernatural, the infallible, and the dogmatic but then never let you pin them down to the older meanings. They would even be insistent that unless you have a true belief you are heterodox, (wont be saved,) and dont get God&#039;s providential blessing. 
They would reject you calling it childish, they would argue one of the six means to say that we dont understand or the realms are separate. they are keeping the eternal truths of God as buddy, life coach, and purveyor of popular psychology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Going by the descriptions of the research here and without having read the book, would it be fair to summarize educated American middle class people described here as essentially thinking of religion in terms of what religious concepts and practices do for them in their lives, and rejecting as childish most traditional notions about: (1) religion (e.g. miracles, traditionally understood as supernatural interventions, prayer, traditionally understood as being effective in producing non-psychological outcomes; (2) God (e.g. traditionally understood as omnipotent, wholly good, etc.), (3) Bible (e.g. traditionally understood as the literal word of God, infallible, describing historical events, etc).

	If that is true, then would it be fair to say that, regardless of whether these middle class Americans understand it in these terms, these middle class Americans regard traditional religion as dead or as belonging to an earlier era?]]></description>
