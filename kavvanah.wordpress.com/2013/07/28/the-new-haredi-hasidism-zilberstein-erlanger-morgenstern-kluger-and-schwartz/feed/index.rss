Katz is more tied to the American self-help literature. His Hasidism/mysticism is romantic and then connected to self-fulfillment. He is more Neveh/ Aish in his tone - he is not reaching Haredi Yeshivot.
I was going to do a post on him and then never did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What do you think of R&#039; Doniel Katz, who seems to have many young women fans (he teaches in a sem, I think)?  He combines mysticism &#038; Mussar into a frothy mix.  He has a good 3-hour lecture on R&#039; Wolbe&#039;s &quot;concentration&quot; method, but I haven&#039;t listened to much else of his yet.  Does he fit your neo-hasidism mix?

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, Alan! I just wanted to add my two anecdotal cents about R. Tzvi Meyer based on spending  a Shabbat with him in Boro Park over a decade ago, because I think the experiential angle is missing from your otherwise great description of this group of mashpiim. What attracted litvishe yeshiva bochurim (which he referred to as Amerikanishe bochurim) to Tzvi Meyer then  - and I suppose the new YU devotees now was never  the depth of the Torah, his kabbalistic understanding etc. It was basically the spiritual athleticism. He operates in the mold of a kind of holy man. Davening takes many many many hours and you find him in completely ecstatic states that demand an amount of stamina that few frum leaders even can hope to emulate - especially the older generation - were they to want it. Even more interesting was watching the almost entirely physical struggle against the mundane that I saw at Sunday morning davening, after the hoopla of Shabbes died down. Tzvi Meyer was locked in a very palpable battle against &quot;shvechkeit&quot; at all times. I also think that even his discourses should be &quot;read&quot; on an experiential level. It&#039;s not the content as much as the passion when talking about passion - the way he articulates &#039;Feuer&#039; and &#039;brenn&#039; and gesticulates. As for the effect of all this spiritual athleticism on the audience, I think it&#039;s pretty much impossible to measure.  The one weekend has certainly &quot;stayed&quot; with me and it&#039;s something I think about not infrequently.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agree with Shaya&#039;s hesitancy.

The service of God is axiomatically an un-selfconcious excercise. Intense devotions based on mystical texts seem to have as much to do with closeness to Hashem as maths has to do with understanding Birchas Shmuel.

I&#039;ll resist my contrarian urge to claim that Rav Shagar was in fact flagrantly anti-modern - and instead point out that his hasidic/mystical/philosophical writings are quite difficult and idiosyncratic and can involve original (and debatable) interpretations of classic hasidic texts as well as mention Sartre and Zizek.  Can&#039;t see them developing much of a following at YU in the absence of R. Shagar&#039;s personal charisma.

On the other hand, R. Shagar&#039;s writings on gemara and halakha  probably would appeal to a certain element.  I wonder if the current bachurim have been at all interested in R. Shagar&#039;s essay on eg. giyur or his methodological writings]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve been interested in the phenomenon of Rabbi Tzvi Meyer Silberberg. In speaking to some young people  I heard of their enthusiasm, especially for the weekly tisch he conducts beginning with shalish seudas and ending hours after shabbus is over. They think he’s truly impressive. I can’t imagine that the content of his talks are so new and special. From what I have heard they are normal themes of chizuk, more davening, more learning, more kedusha. What is new is his delivery. At first when I saw the talk he gave at Pupa (see below) I thought he was deranged, over the top. Who talks like this? Where did he pick up such body language? I now see he modulates his presentation somewhat, as in his talk in English to the Yeshiva Derech Hamelech. I don’t know if it’s my age or because  I have lived in the Midwest for so many years, but I don’t think I could get used to this style. I recognize they said the same thing lehavdil about Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis. So I conclude that though I can’t appreciate this new  taste in preaching, I am happy to see this new energy and hope  it becomes 
a positive force.

If i may jump in - It is because (almost) all the texts and thinkers you just mentioned require a teacher at the very least to make them enjoyable and meaningful (let alone comprehensible). That, and the language barrier (for example, Sihot Hithazkut of R. Zilberstein is really a pattern of the same hebrew words and formulations and easy to aquire also) stand in the way. The &quot;set&quot; that is learning these works is already charting an individualistic path and wants to learn alone, away from the regular beit midrash, and &#039;experience&#039; these texts in solitude.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I fail to see why the rise in neo-Hasidut in YU circles would cause these newly minted aherents to look askance at the more Halakhicly oriented circles. If anything, the sociological reality at YU is quite the opposite: if you are learning from R. Wolfson (whom you fail to mention, but Garb does - as he is especially more relevant than an Erlanger to the American scene) or R. Schwartz in the YU beit midrash, well, you arent learning at all in the eyes of the majority. This culture will not change with the arrival of a new Mashgiach. 

Furthermore, a casual reading of Garb shows how he takes seriously the Kabbala Center, Berg family, even Michael Laitman arbiters of Kabbalah/New-age mysticism in the global spread of these doctrines (by no means does that mean that they are &quot;serious&quot; themselves, as Garb mentions often in The Chosen). I dont understand how a simple question including them in the conversation would render your questioner &quot;clueless&quot; at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Brill, 
What alarms me about what&#039;s going on in YU is not the retreat from (barren) rationalism into mysticism.This is an advance towards more sophisticated texts and spirituality. What alarms me is that they are choose flagrantly anti modern mystical directions instead of pro modern ones like Rav ashlag,Rav kook and his school, Rav Shagar, or at least basic and arguably  neutral texts like Rav Nachman, Tanya etc. Does anyone in YU acually agree with this direction or in mystical realms they are &quot;She&#039;eino Yodea Lish&#039;ol&quot;? Do they have no connection to Hesder counterparts in Israel who might be able to clue them in?!]]></description>
