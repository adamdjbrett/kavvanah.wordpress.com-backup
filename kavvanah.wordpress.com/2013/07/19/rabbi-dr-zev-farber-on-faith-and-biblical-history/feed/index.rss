That&#039;s traditional Judaism.  However, that is not what Farber said:

&quot;I believe that people over the years, through some sort of divine encounter, have been given insight into God’s plan for Israel / the Jews and that these things were put into writing by the various prophets who experienced them and their disciples. Over time these revelations are synthesized and reframed. In the beginning this was how the Torah and the other books of Tanach were compiled. Over time the process moved on to the creation of other works, including the core works of Oral Torah like the Mishna and the Talmud.

In my view, Judaism is essentially a wave that eternally sends the messages of God.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is Farber serious when he thinks that the g’dolim of each generation have been guided by prophecy or ruakh hakodesh? In other words, is this an argument for continuing prophecy of some select individuals ala the Mormon church or some kind of Lutheran-Protestant idea that we are each individually given the gift of divine inspiration in our reading of the tora? I assume it’s the former (and encompasses everyone who the community has followed until now. Because if it’s the latter, we wouldn’t have much of a community and halakha wouldn’t make much sense (why follow what someone else had as divine inspiration when I have it too and it mine says something completely different).

But then, if I understand this correctly, shouldn’t we be even more dogmatic in our approach to halakha/hashkafa? In other words, if hashem is guiding how we have interpreted the tora until now (and how it was stitched together when we go back to the written text), then we can’t really look back at anything historically and decide to interpret it differently now. Or if some of us do, they may turn out in a few hundred years to have been wrong because hashem will have the community following someone else…

My only guess is that eh believes this ruakh hakodesh period ended at some point. But when? After khumash? After y’hoshua? After ester? After ezra? After r’ y’huda hanasi? After ramba”m?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beyond the questions of texts and history, I would be interested to hear Farber&#039;s attitude towards reward and punishment (in the past, present, and future), the messianic age, and resurrection.

They both accept all of the assumptions of academic Bible study and reject the historicity of the Exodus, Sinai and the conquest of Israel.

					<description><![CDATA[It would not surprise me if R. Farber’s article becomes  &lt;i&gt;samizdat&lt;/i&gt; among bochurim in Charedi Yeshivot.   R. Farber offers a meta-theory that is accessible, credible, constructive and yet also achingly honest.  One can quibble with various details, to be sure, but that misses the forest for the trees.  

From my perspective,  one of the standout passages (that you did not quote) is:

“What does a religious person do with in the face of these developments? One reaction is to say that without grounding in historical fact, any religion is valueless and should be jettisoned. In other words, this school of thought believes that the value of Torah is based upon the belief that what it says happened, happened – literally. To me, this implies a paper-thin respect for Torah. I have seen people turn from total observance to nothing after realizing that the biblical narratives were not historical but symbolic.”

But, while R. Farber’s meta-theory may help in combating the OTD problem in the Charedi world, I think the impact within Modern Orthodoxy is more important as it provides a context in which Academic Jewish Studies can be more honestly integrated with one’s religious life.  In this regard, it seems to be a solution set to the problem set articulated by Prof. Moshe Halbertal in 2011 (see particularly, the lecture available on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrgn4k7E20 -- starting at 21:57 for the final 10 mins; now also available as an essay in http://www.bialik-publishing.co.il/product_info.php?products_id=1595).  Or to cut to the essence:

ראשית, המושג &#039;תורה מן השמים&#039; הוא בעייתי ביותר, גם בהגות ימי הביניים. יש כאן לדעתי לא יותר מאשר &#039;מחויבות פונטית&#039;, כלומר להאמין במשהו מילולי, שלא באמת מבינים, וגם לעולם לא נבין עד הסוף. כמו נוסחה מתמטית. ל&#039;תורה מן השמים&#039; היה מעמד כזה במשך דורות רבים. שנית, אדם לא מאבד את אמונתו בעקבות כך שעובדת היסוד של אמונתו התערערה. כשם שנכנסים לאמונה כך יוצאים ממנה. איש לא נכנס לחיי מצוות עקב אישור אמונת היסוד, ולכן גם היציאה אינה עקב ערעור של אמונת יסוד. צורת החיים הדתית כל כך מעורבבת באמונת היסוד, כמו גשר דו כיווני, לא כמו יסוד לבנין.

That said, there is an obstacle on the road that will either stop momentum from this new force of energy, or will be pushed aside: the literalist reading of Rambam’s 7th and, especially, 8th Ikkarim that has become de rigueur dogma in recent decades.   But, if we’re being honest, that is a problem with even Prof. Joshua Berman’s work.  For example, in the article mentioned in your last interview with him, Prof. Berman writes:

“To be sure, the author of Deuteronomy did not expect that a broad readership would be familiar with the niceties of Hittite treaty formulation. My assumption, however, is that the practice of retelling accounts in those treaties is a reflection of what was common practice: when an authority figure—a king in a treaty or a bard in a village—retold a story, his audience focused on how the message had changed, not on the strict factual nature of the claims. Nor should it surprise us that Deuteronomy calls on its readers to access accounts that we find today in the other books of the Pentateuch.”

I think it takes a split mind to reconcile that with Rambam’s Ikkarim -- as I do not think it can be answered with a  straight face why God would transmit to Moshe Torah She’b&#039;Chtav in the context of Hittite diplomacy/politics, in their literary style.   And, if it is because Dibra Torah b’Lashon Bnei Adam, why would the generation of Ma’amad Har Sinai, emerging from 400 years of slavery in Egypt, care either?  It is hardly consonant with what we know about their concerns and sociology based on the Mikra.

R. Farber’s article provides a meta-theory that now provides room for the more detailed work of Prof. Berman and others within a Modern Orthodox (as opposed to fundamentalist Orthodox) context.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;in order to understand how to apply these messages we must understand how any given halacha or ideal functioned in any given society, particularly the original society, ancient Israel. When we understand this, we can “subtract” the societal elements to see the ideas in their relative purity and reapply them to our times.&quot;

With respect to the author and his worthy project, you may be able to understand how an ideal or halacha functioned in its time, but abstracting the supposedly pure idea is itself nothing more than an act of interpretation which isn&#039;t in any non question-begging way better or distinguishable from another interpretive strategy except insofar as it reflects the preferences of the interpreter. There is no Archimedean point from which to decide which interpretive strategy is truer to the original idea or has better captured the essence of the original.

Recognizing this problem you retreat in the next sentence with &quot;Waves, however, require continuity. For this reason, it is vital to understand how the Torah functioned in every generation since Moshe in order to do this right. This requires serious study and thought.&quot;

This seems to be a point in favor of some kind of historicist-traditionalist hybrid. But then why not leave aside the historicist aspect? Perhaps the claim that a historicist search for the essence of a halakhic ideal is now the preferred method of arriving at religious truth appears to rest on the idea that every generation (person?) is supposed to use the (best?) interpretive tools at its disposal to hear God&#039;s message. By what standard are historical-critical methods the best? Perhaps each individual supposed to use the ones that she finds to be the most compelling? Soon we can have halacha according to Derrida, Cover, Bakhtin. Zizek etc. etc. 

The problem is partly alluded by your (mis)application of the term &quot;Kuhnian paradigm shift.&quot; What distinguishes Kuhn&#039;s notion of scientific change is that after a revolutionary paradigm shift scientists are very suddenly no longer speaking a language compatible with the older theoretical paradigm. To say this has happened many times in history regarding the world&#039;s &quot;understanding of its past and the foundations of its religious identity&quot; is overstating things considerably. But let&#039;s agree that something like this has happened at some point in the fairly recent past in the transition to the modern period. Kuhn realized that contemporary scientists tended not to notice that anything so radical had occurred and simply see science as a continually progressive enterprise. Kuhn&#039;s theory and most of philosophy of science is a meta-discourse that has no effect on how scientists work or think. This is probably just as well.
Science works fine with the slightly narrow and perhaps slightly naive view of the scientific consciousness. Religion may also function best with the narrow and slightly naive religious consciousness. By all means argue otherwise--but make that argument. Is the prophetic mode now self-conscious historicist contextualizing of Halacha? Please explain why.]]></description>

To say this has happened many times in history regarding the world&#8217;s &#8220;understanding of its past and the foundations of its religious identity&#8221; is overstating things considerably. But let&#8217;s agree that something like this has happened at some point in the fairly recent past in the transition to the modern period. Kuhn realized that contemporary scientists tended not to notice that anything so radical had occurred and simply see science as a continually progressive enterprise. Kuhn&#8217;s theory and most of philosophy of science is a meta-discourse that has no effect on how scientists work or think. This is probably just as well.<br />
Science works fine with the slightly narrow and perhaps slightly naive view of the scientific consciousness. Religion may also function best with the narrow and slightly naive religious consciousness. By all means argue otherwise&#8211;but make that argument. Is the prophetic mode now self-conscious historicist contextualizing of Halacha? Please explain why.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Noam.  I think you are being unfair.  He is advancing the claim of a more academically sophisticated evidence based approach to Torah.

What it does not provide is apollogetics for the old way of looking at things.

					<description><![CDATA[I have a few problems with this approach.

1. Farber is claiming a greater degree of intellectual honesty than previous approaches (such as the literary-theological or allegorical) to coming to terms with some of these issues. I fail to see how his approach is more intellectually honest. Isn&#039;t he just drawing the lines in slightly different places? He concludes that the layers of which the Torah is composed were written by prophets operating in the prophetic mode. This conclusion is also one that he would never have reached in an area of inquiry in which he did not have a preconceived religious stake. Wouldn&#039;t your standard academic scholar claim that the stylistic, content, and methodological similarities between the Torah texts and other contemporary text demonstrate scientifically that the Torah texts are no more prophetic than others?

2. I feel like his decision to accept the idea that the Torah is written in layers by different authors at different times seems somewhat arbitrarily based in his personal intellectual experiences. Almost all of the concerns he raised are really addressed by acknowledging the a-historicity of the biblical stories. That conclusion can be reached easily by resorting to some of the approaches he criticizes (again, such as the literary-theological or allegorical). The only &quot;evidence&quot; for the layered approach are the cases in which there are different accounts of the same stories/laws. Farber pays lip service to the fact that historical/literary evidence is not the same type of evidence we have in the &quot;hard sciences,&quot; even as he attempts to blur those boundaries by quoting scientific paradigm shifts to bolster his claims by association. To be sure, there is much that academics have discovered which makes a *simple* every word of the Torah was dictated by God and it is absolutely literally historically accurate approach untenable. However, the suggestion that the evidence points to Farber&#039;s particular attempt at homogenization is equally untenable. It seems all too likely that he arrives at this approach because he has been intensely exposed to source critical views.

3. I find it unhelpful when Rabbi/scholars who are claiming to advance the cause of attempting a more academically sophisticated approach to Torah do so by writing in a manner which would not pass the academic bar. If Farber is seriously trying to convince people to reconsider how they approach Torah, it should not be in the form of &quot;you must accept x,y,z academic doctrine, because trust me the evidence supports it.&quot; The goal should be to expose people to the academic approach of seriously grappling with evidence based reasoning. As such, he should have presented evidence in a more even handed, academically thorough way. For instance, he cites the lack of evidence that the Jews were in Egypt. No footnote, no discussion. Sarna has claimed that there is a period in Egyptian history which could support the basic contours of the story if not all the details. Is Sarna a totally unfair apologist? Has he been discredited by the academy in the last few decades? I have no idea. Give me some evidence. But Farber shouldn&#039;t just put out bold claims without evidence. Even if he is right, he defeats what should be the larger purpose which should be to engage MO Jews in seriously dealing with the issues in an sophisticated way, not to convince readers of any one particular set of conclusions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Farber&#039;s definition of Torah Min Ha-Shamayim and Torah mi-Sinai seem to be very different from how I understand them.   His &quot;pintele yid&quot; doesn&#039;t want to give up, but his intellect is rejecting these core concepts.  Ultimately, he trusts in his intellect more than in the tradition he has received and learned.  My approach is to accept the tradition as a fact and try to ascend the &quot;path of the just&quot;, and hope that I achieve greater understanding as the years go by, but not to be worried or feel like a hyocrite]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I consider your paradigm to be very empowering to the individual Jew who is told that he must check his own faith at the door and in essence substitute the faith of someone more learned than they.
