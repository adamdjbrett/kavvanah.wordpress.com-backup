					<description><![CDATA[I heartily and respectfully thank Professor Green and Eric for their replies, as well as the &quot;admission&quot; by R. David Hartman, z&quot;l, which I am still trying to digest. My gut, though, seems still on fire; I find it difficult to accept either the admission of David Hartman or the reply of Professor Green. If Prof. Green wants only to take up issues of contemporary relevance, David Hartman&#039;s scholarly philosophical work on Maimonides was key to his politics of religion. His Jewish political influence suffuses the major Jewish newspaper of New York and Jewish Federation politics. 
Of course, Yeshaya Leibovitz actually belonged to the religious Zionist camp, but Hartman somewhat plausibly used him as a foil to represent everyone from the most extreme camps in Mosad HaRav to the Litvish yeshivaleit, who historically inherit from the Vilna Gaon views akin to Leibovitz. (By the way, Leibovitz&#039; views are akin, also, to Al-Ghazali, with whom Maimonides must have been intimately familiar). 

However, R. Hartman attacked the Centrist Orthodoxy in which his education culminated for at its core being inauthentic. &quot;The God Who Hates Lies,&quot; he called one of his books, after all. Now it is true, a lot of Hartman&#039;s disagreement elsewhere was against his teacher, Rav Soloveichik, z&quot;l. But the Rav  would have approved and encouraged Hartman&#039;s attack upon both Strauss and Leibovitz. Showing how Maimonidean thought in the Guide was to be found &quot;integrated&quot; throughout all the exoteric ouvre, contra Strauss, would have been right up the Rav&#039;s alley and would have probably received great encouragement, from what I know of the Rav&#039;s thought. So the attack was still on Strauss. Hartman spearheaded efforts, with several other religious leaders in halakhic Judaism collaborating, and with the collusion of most of the Jewish psychology and social work establishment, to &quot;reform&quot; the halakhically-observant world in the name of &quot;authenticity.&quot;  

Przysucha Hasidism, the nearest historical precedent for such a revolution, pales by comparison, since the whole of modern life has been affected by the psychological revolution of the society at large. And the brunt of the damage wrought by this revolution has been borne by Centrist, Classical Orthodoxy, I&#039;m convinced. Hartman&#039;s extreme modernist faction of the halakhically-observant will eventually, I think, be absorbed gradually into liberal Judaism, as A.J. Heschel and his updated Kotzker thought has been. Those who think halakhic thought must be reduced to Leibovitz&#039; pure gezerot or Divine decrees/fiats, will remain and not budge noticeably; perhaps they may be joined by a remnant of refugees from Hartman&#039;s onslaught. Devastated are or will shortly be all who represent Centrist, Classical Orthodoxy, as a segment of Centrist, Classical Western culture, a devastation which Allan Bloom decried and predicted in the general Western world, and which has long been happening in our Jewish world, as well. We Classical Centrists, well, like Strauss, our positions are just much more nuanced, more dialectical. We dare not reveal all sides of the dialectic.
We cannot comply with the incessant demand our society makes for complete disclosure of everything about our innermost thoughts at every turn, or be dismissed as &quot;inauthentic&quot; We feel there is benefit in playing traditional roles at the expense of compromising our authenticity, although we aren&#039;t oblivious to authenticity&#039;s loss and its consequences, and thus we Centrists cannot glibly &quot;sell&quot; our Judaism with smooth talk the way the black-hat kiruv people can do. It&#039;s nice of R. Hartman z&quot;l to have admitted so much later, but before his death, that we esotericist &quot;dualists&quot; had  a point, after all - after he&#039;s destroyed us. 
As for Professor Green&#039;s feeling that justifying esotericism, justifying not being &quot;out there on Facebook&quot; with every consideration in your world-view would just be to hard to do and would be poorly understood at a general public gathering, well, isn&#039;t that part of the problem? Doesn&#039;t the public desperately need to understand the world of an esotericist, a world where there are several different ways truth is to be evaluated in dialectical tension, and why this position is not necessarily &quot;inauthentic&quot; and subject to the ridicule of modern social science? 

The cri de coeur of Allan Bloom&#039;s books about the modern loss of classical dialectic, classical balance in weighing words, and classical religion, resonates for me greatly in the Jewish world, including the Orthodox one, today. Hopefully, although you declined to discuss the inner dilemmas of us classical esotericists in public (a decision which, I have to admit, makes a lot of sense, since it is esoteric, although that never stopped Allan Bloom nor Gershom Scholem, for that matter, from writing a best-seller, nor did it stop many other Straussians from assuming very public personae), I will find out much more about the inner struggles and dilemmas of esotericists (as well as very public figures, in their own rights) such as Strauss and Maimonides in your books.]]></description>
