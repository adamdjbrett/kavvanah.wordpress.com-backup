<p>Below is a translation of an essay by Rabbi Menachem Froman z”l of Tekoa done by Levi Morrow. <a href="../../../../../2016/08/17/rabbi-menachem-froman-my-followers-will-laugh-from-this/index.html">We have a long prior post on this blog discussing Rav Froman’s ideas and a translation of some of his aphorisms here.</a> The essay below discusses how we can remove the social mask we wear by an act of self-acceptance, showing a noted similarity to the thought of Rav Shagar.</p>



<h3>Translator’s Introduction-Levi Morrow</h3>



<p>Rav <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Froman">Menachem Froman</a> (d. 2013) was a Religious Zionist <em>rosh yeshivah</em>, grassroots political activists, and all-around cultural figure. The narrative arc of his life moves from growing up secular and studied for a degree in Jewish philosophy at Hebrew University (though students inform me he never took the final exams that would have enabled him to graduate) to becoming religious and studying at <em>Merkaz Harav</em>. He <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HasidimTsohakimMiZeh/photos/a.2349700938389268/2507799512579409/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCHRjlprvu1M9ELPH9Qq5csmgx0D8VLGeSyRJENgNE_De2UXcpA7Z43GXh5G9inIAtL9XDeUWzMueRM9OVQU2fMIPo6KuTcmWY05ySb_FUFNYo21mxaL0nF3A8HC7TAm89-mafUrS8O4vZrv6fD86yEYwh2ofXkFdlV1znoa2cryoaNZDKd3WjpmttS5LWMDweb2va2vzCuV_GQyp8xcyemVDvhOoD3_3IQJTT2PN7oB5ryYeIvz2ja2jqetmmLfZlbZQT42AOF8fSczu0fj8gvokFkMppvIuX6-UH1vYwtBDCCXQzS-8NiWxHH9I5Qdz093tuU5xRsc_qSEKctFCeMEYYV&amp;__tn__=-R">became Rav Tsvi Yehuda Kook’s personal attendant</a>. He would later become a <a href="https://thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/the-anti-spiritual-rabbi-a-students-perspective/">teacher</a> and <em>rosh yeshivah</em> in his own right, as well as a driving figure in the grassroots movement for peace between Israel and Palestine.</p>



<p>He also had a  deep and enduring <a href="https://www.facebook.com/levidmorrow/posts/10161567542020161">interest in all forms of creativity</a>–art, poetry, literature, <a href="../../../../../2012/08/07/rabbi-menachem-froman-on-the-theater/index.html">theater</a>, etc. Among his posthumously published <a href="../../../../../2016/08/17/rabbi-menachem-froman-my-followers-will-laugh-from-this/index.html">writings</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HasidimTsohakimMiZeh/">teachings</a>, is a book of poetry entitled <a href="https://mashiv.org.il/product/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%98-%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%A3/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%92%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F/"><em>Accounting for Madness</em></a> (HEB). His poetic, creative sensibilities, however, cannot be confined to his poetry. In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HasidimTsohakimMiZeh/photos/a.2349700938389268/2395245567168138/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBhn0hUX--b5Nb6FpbtgyhpyFyCHG7S-KU8nKpN-eOgfDle6NfxZlLdO__wm8yqvwXkLPYhVCr5Pr-O5FHt3y3FgtdqOC9JrToNWx9-ujD26JJgm3QdqMHQ5CgOJvZePneTjPQvqTPs4OTNo5NiX4FnAEp22iC97Qm_Xh8E_R8aCcC1DBUes0xCm16feGrxRnxI1ZubORFG9X_CjrJuA1xsUCQ8M1xI0WzuQsK1KsyX_BREKbnUnUvKV6DCpaAHLFMLBlkIWmNJ-cswZL6JgrTVVM2pnpX6qLPaK9U1_PnBEDTad7I2jELCkj6yL_eJMAUJpQbLhclMpdkocTDgI2Q-O_iq&amp;__tn__=-R">one of his Torah teachings</a>, he poetically equates religiosity with depth and suggests that depth–such as found in the writings of Franz Kafka and Amos Oz–is somehow divine.</p>



<p>This blending of the religious and the poetic may never be more clear than in the Torah teaching translated below, which meditates on the image of a face–and what it means to have a face. The face is the very nature of Torah itself. In this short piece honoring the anniversary of Moshe’s death, the 7<sup>th</sup> of Adar, Rav Menachem Froman explores the issue of identity through the metaphor of the face.</p>



<p>According to Rav Froman, our face is something we are essentially stuck with, yet it also plays a pivotal role in how other people identify us, and perhaps even in how we identify ourselves. As such, the face serves as a fitting symbol for the more inflexible aspects of ourselves, such as our families and cultural upbringings. Some people spend their entire lives trying to escape who they are, only to realize they’ve run directly into being themselves. We put on masks, trying on new identities, typically only to discover that the change is not even skin deep. Is real change–changing our face rather than simply putting on a mask–even possible?</p>



<p>Moses, <em>Moshe Rabbeinu</em>, drawn from the water, son to both Egyptian princess and Israelite slave woman, is a man of many faces and identities: prince of Egypt, hard-fisted seeker of justice, leader of thankless complainers, and prophet-legislator of God’s people. In many ways, the lion’s share of the Torah is dedicated to descriptions of Moses as he slips between these roles, or perhaps grows into each one in turn.</p>



<p>So how did Moshe relate to himself, to the constraints of his inflexible face? Rav Froman proposes two possibilities: First, perhaps Moshe simply ignored his face, refused to let it determine the course of his life. Given enough determination, we can create ourselves, choosing who we want to be rather than simply accepting ourselves as given. Second, perhaps Moshe recognized the force his identity exerted upon his life, and consciously accepted it. He “saw his own face from within rather than from without,” meaning that he was simultaneously able to appreciate his identity from a distance and still experience it as his identity–a paradoxical blend of freedom and attachment that Rav Froman suggests may not “make any sense to say.” Choosing to embrace a given situation can change it from a prison to a home, from dim fate into luminous destiny. This, Rav Froman suggests, may even be the deepest element of the Moshe’s teachings.</p>



<p>These two approaches correspond to two important ideas in the thought of Rav Froman’s long-time friend and colleague, <a href="https://thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/god-torah-self-accepting-the-yoke-of-heaven-in-the-writings-of-rav-shagar/">Rav Shagar: self-creation and self-acceptance</a>. Rav Shagar grapples constantly with the nature of the self and personal identity, oscillating between–or attempting to synthesize–the two poles of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and Jean-Paul Sartre. Sometimes Shagar wants us to recognize that we have a pre-existing identity and choose it freely, and sometimes he wants us to boldly choose to create ourselves, to shape ourselves into who we want to be without any thought to who we already are. So too in this piece from Rav Froman.</p>



<p>This text reflects Rav Froman’s sophisticated literary sensibilities. Most of it is an extended, playful discussion of what it means to have a face. On the more technical side, the text is also full to brimming with specifically chosen language, whether face-related metaphors, references to traditional Jewish texts, or instances that combine the two. I (Levi Morrow) have done my best to convey all of these linguistic elements into English to the best of my ability, but there was never a chance of perfect success. Many elements simply could not be recreated in this English version, and readers are therefore referred to <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VytIbJQeIoXbe3yqAJZVXz4hVYOaXgGR">the felicitous Hebrew original</a> in <em>Ten Li Zeman</em>. I have attempted to smooth out or clarify any awkward instances and obscurities resulting from this poetic translation, but any that remain are surely the fault of the translator, not Rav Froman or any editors.</p>

<p>We have known Moses since Egypt. We have known him face to face. Sculptors and artists of generations made use–like spies–of their greatest and freest creativity, making wild and far-ranging guesses. Ultimately, it is clear to anyone who looks that these artists depicted Moses in their own image–his face is their face (not that this devalues their art in any way). In contrast, we know exactly what he looked like. We don’t feel any need to try and depict him. What would be the result? That he had a big nose? A high forehead? Anything we could say wouldn’t actually clarify anything. And what does it matter anyway? Suffice it to say that he had a face just like each of us.</p>



<p>And just like each of us, Moses certainly suffered from his face from time to time. Who would tell such a bold-faced lie as to deny that they sometimes wish they could change their appearance? Having to wear the same face day after day, moment after moment–is exhausting. Some people face this duty with great enthusiasm–they smile broadly, full-lipped. Some consistently and intentionally take the two-faced path. These are the bold-faced revolutionaries who would see their own faces (and those of others) thrown back in either wild laughter or heart-wrenching tears. The heart can perhaps even be torn, but not the face. Acts of despair like these don’t change the way things look. In the best case scenario, these attempts result in a few more wrinkles. Only the light cloud resting over the frustrated face alludes to the heroism-turned-embarrassment.</p>



<p>Many put their trust in time. But with every journey, and with every stop, the hardships of the wilderness increasingly scorch our faces. Moreover, the years bring old age–as they always do, which is why we cannot uplift the face of the noble, nor give splendor to the face of the wretched (Leviticus 19:15; Job 34:19)–and begin to mark us with its signs. So you imagine that, at this heavy cost, perhaps you have at least had some success in that external realm that is as intimate as possible–more trenches in your forehead, more cuts around your disappointed mouth. You have a conversation with your contemporary about the ways you’ve managed to escape your fate, when your son comes up and your friend lets slip the unkindest cut of all: “Wow, he’s so similar to you! Like one face reflecting another in water! (Proverbs 27:19)!”</p>



<p>We have no choice but to lower our eyes and admit, ashamed, that we live in this terrible state of constant denial and avoidance (<em>hester panim</em>). Someone with a big nose will have it his whole life, no matter how wide his nostrils flare with anger. He can’t reduce his suffering by even a millimeter unless he avails himself of the surgeon’s scalpel.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s always the most radical path–you could wear a mask. The immediate result would no doubt be striking, but its protection wouldn’t last forever. It will immediately become clear that this winning ticket–which fell into your hand as if from heaven–comes with a heavy price. A mask, by definition, is something external, not internal. The problem I describe affects us all too deeply for some superficial fix. You can’t escape the claustrophobic constraints of your face behind the even harsher constraints of the mask, just like you can’t escape thick chains by fleeing into a dungeon. Someone persuaded to follow this path will ultimately tear off–in a fit of terror–the veil that surrounds him. This dangerous path necessarily brings confusion, and you will spend far too much time trying to remove your own face. When you finally realize your mistake, your face will blacken like the bottom of a pot.</p>



<p>These hardships–which are the fate of every person–affected our teacher Moses as well. Even after he went up to Mount Sinai twice and neither ate nor drank for days on end, and even after the rest of his miracles, Moses kept guiding us with the same bright eyes and kind face we always knew. However, certain events suggest to the unbiased mind that something here is different–the cord that connects all men has here been cut. We cannot forget that right after his encounters with the creator, when he brought us God’s holy words, we saw his face as simultaneously terrible and wondrous. It was as if the very skin of his face shone and became like a speculum that shines. In a manner defying all understanding, anyone who looked at Moses then could see that he had no idea that something special was happening to him; he was acting as though his face remained the same as always. My proof: Moses did not understand our fear and continued to address us and summon us before him.</p>



<p>The careful scoffers dismiss these contradictions by saying, “It was Moses! We can’t know anything about him!” But his faithful devotees claim that Moses merited that for which every man on the face of this earth hopes, and escaped his unfortunate constraints (<em>metsarim</em>). They add that he merited this because–in contrast to all of us–he never felt pinned down by the contours of his face.</p>



<p>Expert readers of the biblical verses explain that Moses hid his face <em>from his face</em>, meaning that he saw his own face from within rather than from without, if that makes any sense to say. This lack of self-awareness–which is both simpler and more complex–is why the Torah says that he was the humblest of all (Numbers 12:3), that no one had arisen like him who knew God face to face (Deuteronomy 34:10). The fact that he continues to appear as he had previously, they explain, was an act not unlike putting on a mask. Moses stepped free of the fate of his face, but he took it up again out of free will. Perhaps we should call this what it is: A chosen face. Some say this is the innermost aspect of the Torah of Moses.</p>
