					<description><![CDATA[In an email discussion, from one of the many people who continue to email me instead of leaving a comment, it came out that she supported Sefardi culture in the US. She published Hakham Faur&#039;s earliest essays on Sefardi pride and supported Nissim Rejwan.

She wrote a letter about Sefardi culture to Commentary:

To the Editor:

Chaim Raphael&#039;s conclusion in “Jewish History and the Sephardim” [May] that “some transformation is called for in which the pride of the Sephardi heritage is given the weight it deserves in Jewish self-consciousness” must be acted upon, in order to heal the damage caused by Israel&#039;s Western chauvinism. This proclamation of Western superiority has been, and is, a dual curse for Israel: in addition to alienating more than half of Israel&#039;s Jews, it also estranges and is an irritant to Israel&#039;s Arabs (approximately 600,000) and its Arab neighbors.

It is high time for Ashkenazim to ponder George Steiner&#039;s remarks in Language and Silence: “We know now that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day&#039;s work at Auschwitz. . . . The mass murder of the Jews and . . . the destruction under Nazism and Stalinism . . . rose from . . . the core of European civilization.”

As for stimulating pride in the Sephardi heritage, there are much more basic ingredients of the Jewish heritage than the centuries of the “Jewish-Muslim symbiosis” and Yemenite folklore and dance, though these are important. But infinitely more important is the fact that the basic Jewish texts were created in the “Orient.” I am referring to those texts which all Jews venerate and in which Jewish faith is articulated. There is, first of all, the Hebrew Bible, whose imagery, flora and fauna, seasons and calendar are those of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near and Middle East. The prayers for weekdays, holidays, and the Sabbath which are not biblical texts were written by Babylonian and Egyptian Jews a thousand and more years ago. The additions of the Ashkenazi prayer rite are incidental and lack halakhic validity. The Mishnah; the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds; the midrashim and the vast geonic literature; the many kabbalistic texts, notably the Zohar; the Shulhan Arukh, the authoritative code of law—all these basic and truly great Jewish works are the creations of the ancestors of those who, today, are Israel&#039;s edot hamizrach, “Oriental”/Sephardi Jews. . . .

					<description><![CDATA[I agree , she was most certainly ahead of her time and a progressive force for peace and understanding.

I do want to say something about the &#039;Orientalism &#039; of Jewish culture preventing Jews from becoming integrated in the Arab world. I feel this is becoming a cliche, and should be examined. Despite the hopes of Herzl and Weizman, Israeli culture is not exactly the high culture of Central Europe. Excluding the charedim who live in a century of their own, Israeli culture is more of a Mediterranean culture if anything. Sexually, Israel is a &#039;hot&#039; country, far different from the more repressed sexual culture of the Midwest or Northern Europe. They are more LA than Frankfurt. 

Without  pinning this down in detail, my point can be made looking at the Arab side. There are basically three big cultures. The Beirut type world, non fundamentalist, multicultural world that one used to find in Cairo and Baghdad, a Shiite world and a Wahabi Saudi world. The former never was a cultural problem. The wars were between Arab states and their big shot dictators and Israel. Those wars are now over. That leaves the Shia and the jihadists. Looking just at the jihadists they would be even more upset if Israel was Brazil or Argentina. The Pakistanis think India is not sufficiently chassidish. The Jihadists vision is focused on the desert, flat , dry , endless. They hate cities and tall buildings. They hate America. They are too monotheistic, too anti images, to a point where they blow up buddhas  in Afghani mountains. They need some chasidus and varmkeit. Maybe a folksbein teayater. It&#039;s not an imposition of classical music that they hate, it&#039; s a hatred of anything that is an enemy of nomadism]]></description>
