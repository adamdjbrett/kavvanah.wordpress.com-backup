					<description><![CDATA[I see you read the Urban Dictionary:

Brillig&#039;s Law 		
It&#039;s impossible to distinguish between a troll and a real neocon wingnut because no matter how stupid the troll&#039;s posts, we&#039;ve all seen something equally as stupid from an actual neoconservative. 
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Brillig%27s%20Law

Brilliantist 	
A name for a job that doesn&#039;t exist. First used by professional Brilliantist Joseph Hilton Bunn(1989)

					<description><![CDATA[They  all are  anti essentialist views, an idea at one time attached to nominalism and Duns Scotus  and now associated with the mainstream of analytic philosophy. In European philosophy the free play of Derrida is sort of an analogue. I feel  the theses are connected and form a larger whole, but you ask for a catchy name for just two. 

I would suggest The Spectral Heresy denoting the view that things that were traditionally considered real are mere specters or virtual objects.]]></description>

Judaism lacks an essence. There are just books and more books

Can we give this one a specific name, limited to that aspect? 

Or this one?  The Jews are a collection of unfriendly tribes at best, not a people or a nation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The following views are considered heretical:

Judaism lacks an essence. There are just books and more books.  Denominations creates a false depth.

Judaism lacks a religious or cultural center. Renewal can just as well  come from anywhere and seep into  Israel.

The Jews are a collection of unfriendly tribes at best, not a people or a nation. 

Torah is open ended, with multiple underground tunnels burrowing  to and from the outside world. 

Holding on to God, Israel and the Torah is like holding onto air. Nothing will be ultimately left standing, only the endless desert, where it all started.

These heresies are  a new  shift towards a more radical anti- idolatry type monotheism, Wahabi  style. Let’s call this heresy The  New Apocalyptic Judaism.

You heard it here first.  (You asked.LOL)

In this regard I want to recommend Reza Negastrani’s  &quot;Cyclonopedia.&quot; She is now.
