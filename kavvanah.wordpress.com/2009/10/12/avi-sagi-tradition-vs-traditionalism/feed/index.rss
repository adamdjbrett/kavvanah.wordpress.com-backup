					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/avi-sagi-tradition-vs-traditionalism/#comment-304&quot;&gt;Jeff Wild&lt;/a&gt;.

It was published in English before I started blogging. I may come back at some point and post on it. 
It is a very good book but...   
There is an good article in one of Israeli Torah journals, I dont have reference at hand, pointing out corrections from a beit medrash point of view. 
His use of the word pluralism is too vague. Many of his Eastern European sources are intellectual pluralists but not moral pluralists. he could have used some more analytic rigor - see Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. 1990. &quot;Varieties of Pluralism in a Polyphonic Society.&quot; Review of Metaphysics 44:3–20]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Alan,

I am wondering what you think of Avi Sagi&#039;s Open Canon? From what I have read, it seems like a thoughtful exploration of the Talmudic tradition of &quot;elu-va-elu divre Elokim hayyim.&quot;

Warmly,
Jeff]]></description>
