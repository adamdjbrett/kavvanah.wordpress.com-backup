					<description><![CDATA[I gave you what I got. I gave a way of understanding mitzvot, and a schema for deciding larger issues  like feminism. I could also run the same argument on whether it is  rational to ask of all Jews that they emigrate to Israel. But to ask me to decide on individual halachot and in an Orthodox context no less is asking too much. This was never intended as an algorithm for generating rules. 

Again, in response to how much weight to give to textual sources when they define practises that are clearly Rawlsian unjust by todays conceptions of reality, for example slavery, the answer is I don&#039;t know. I would go with Rawls, but what Orthodox rabbis would say and do is usualy up for grabs.

An excellent example is taxes and the infamous Rabbi Cohen. On a Rawlsian philosophy there is a duty of fair play that rules out shirkers. End of story. There was a lot of talk about chilul hasem, which is actually a very weak reason for prohibiting stealing on taxes. I wrote up the Rawlsian reason, some agreed, and by the next day it was chilul hashem 24x7 all over again. 

And finally are there Jewish institutions, mitzvot that fail Rawlsian standards of fairness the answer is undoubtedly yes. It&#039;s a problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After all that you just change discussion midstream.
You were presenting your Rawls views of halakhah and orthodoxy. You were explaining why it would be a good approach, then you switch gears and tell me about a third party called Reform Jews and your understanding-projection on them. 
You were explaining why this is a meaningful taamei hamizvot for you and why this is a useful way to make halakhic decisions, then you lost the train of thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I meant to say Bruce and a commenter wrote about reflective equilibrium in a Jewish context and in a novel way :
http://www.threejews.net/

Halbertal in the book I read tries to explain why we are entitled to give precedence to our own over humanity, even when on a utilitarian and even Christian principles we should consider  where we can do most good. It is one more blow against the  Pauline ideal of there being neither Jew or Greek inside the unified all encompaasing church. Rawls handles this in a natural way by first considering justice within a nation and only then going on to talk how justice between nations or global justice requires modifications of the initial principles. The killer application is justice between generations, and there I loose touch with the literature.

You know Reform Jews these days are all effectively Rawlsians. Many have heard the ideas, and except for some country club Republicans most endorse stronger redistributions when the trickle down effects are marginal. Our parents to the extent they supported the New Deal and certainly the old Jewish left and the Labor Zionists are all in synch with this philosophy. What Rawls accomplished is take a bunch of ideas, none of which are totally convincing and put it together as a whole . In the beginning he spoke of strong proofs. Later he spoke of a balance of considerations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/justice-or-rawls-lives/#comment-86&quot;&gt;evanstonjew&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;&quot;So without utilizing metaphysics or authority there would have to be empirically based, readily agreed upon  reasons&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

What would be the theoretical objections to your position? What would we need to overcome, as a theory of halakah, to make yours a viable system. I am not asking inertia or sociological objection and of cource I know most people look for authority and metaphysics.
But what are the theoretical issues. For example, how do the textual sources influence the decision? What do you do when the textual sources do not offer any fair solution? 
What do you offer in a practical sense over Halbertal?

Definitely make comment here and not by email. People are still sending me emails and Facebook messages, even after I asked to put comments here.
Also- you refered to a comment you made on another blog- can you either cite it or give the url?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If I am correct so far&quot;...let&#039;s say yes.

&quot;Rawls actually wants you to return to the black box point to make a decision.&quot;...you mean if we took this Rawlsian derech would we judge issues from a veil of ignorance, armed with limited knowledge etc...I would say yes, that would be helpful. Imagine dealing with feminist issues not knowing how you will end up male or female.Clearly on the conservative view there is no equality of opportunity.  Rawls restricts all knowledge in the original position to non metaphysical knowledge, and he gives arguments. No one can argue for policy X simply because Hashem told him or or RJBS said so in his drasha on the 2 accounts of how Chava was created. So without utilizing metaphysics or authority there would have to be empirically based, readily agreed upon  reasons to discriminate against women. Maybe there are, but in a Jewish context, thinking this way is progress. This approach doesn&#039;t necessarily generate unique answers, but in requiring principles as the basis of rules, and a deduction for the principles it brings out more clearly how these things are not isolated. Bringing out what is involved in thinking patriarchally is already helpful, since so  much of the oppression hangs on obscurantist arguments. 

I am happy you mentioned my favorite buzz word &#039;specters&#039;. Irrelevant here, but I have some thoughts on your Fackenheim post involving the issue of being haunted by specters. If it is ok with you I would like to explain it a bit in greater detail. I could send you an email , or post it as a comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So let me see if I get you yet.
You are saying that Rawls has explanatory power for our age, the set up of his approach can help us construct a meaningful understanding of the mizvot system.
Our mizvah intuitions play the role of his ethical intuitions.
If I am correct so far, 
then can you explain further- Rawls actually wants you to return to the black box point to make a decision. How does this play itself out in making Jewish decisions?
Do we start at this intuition point because we are spectral Jews?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is getting tangled and here is not the place. Bekitzur there is a Rawlsian idea of reflective equilibrium. (See 3jews4opinions for a clever application.)We start with intuitions and try to develop principles adjusting each until we are in a stable place.These principles are then understood as the outcome of a hypothetical agreement under certain conditions,a black box as it were. We try to create a black box which generates principles that end up in synch with our intuitions. And if we  modify our intuitions then principles might need to be changed as well as the black box. My main point is the mitzvot, now taking the place of intuitions  are to be understood in terms of general principles which are a result of some a priori agreement. This is an explanation, a way of understanding the deep structure of torah, not a prescription that we should accept  Rawls specific ideas about justice. 

God is not critical for principles of the right except maybe as a law enforcer/accountant. God may be part of our understanding of the good and the good life, which first of all must be commensurate with the principles of justice. A Rawlsian approach to God and the good life involves questions such as whether a rational life plan would include spirituality as a goal, how such a goal fits in with the other virtues and how religion can support a just and therefore liberal society and avoid intolerance.It&#039;s a parsha all its own.

Thomas Nagel and Gil Harman reprinted an unknown undergrad essay of Rawls on religion in the TLS around two years ago. It is remarble how his future mature ideas are already implicit in his thinking. Worth reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok- so let me try and understand you. Torah is to be accepted as a Rawlsian vision of fairness and justice. We accept the Torah the way one accept the outcome of a Rawlsian first position.

If so, the question is not God, rather:Why? For Leibowitz and Goldman, the goal is to preserve God despite modern life. For Soloveitchik, the goal is the redeemed existence away from the material animal life to the rational ordering of a moral order, and then a further redemption into the religious order. If the purpose here the need for ethics? Do you have a religious ethics and do not see a purpose in autonomous ethics? Are you possibly solving the problem of heteronomy by  moving away from faith as a justification and toward the rational decision of the original position?  

It also seems that you are defining Jewish justice, since you quote RYBS, as the halakhic realm. So the Biblical agriculture laws are not your criteria but the halkhic system. 

Halbertal is already accepting Hartman and post Rawls: Sandel, Dworken, and others. We are constructing a Rawls insight because we want a living covenant- a construction, not an ahistoric dialectic view of relgion.

I am slightly surprised that you did not play your rawls ideas off of the Sagi presentation of his 4 thinkers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chakira...This is my understanding of the issue. Kant asks how can we know synthetic a priori sentences like 2+2=4 are true? How can we knowsuch arithmetic truths when knowledge of these sentences are not based on experience?

RJBS  is not talking of such truths. Shabus begins at sundown  is either a convention created by rabbis , not a truth  discovered by the rabbis, or it is known because the rabbi  read this  in a book and believes  the author of the book  knows because of a chain of mesorah going back to Sinai. Moses knew when Shabus begins because God told him, and either God decided this or looked into a pre existent torah. All these possibilities are not a priori. The sentence &quot;Frum Jews believe shabus begins at sundown&quot; is a truth about what Jews believe and is not at all puzzling. 

So unless there is some a priori deduction involved even in the most general way, saying shekiah is an apriori concept comes to no more than saying we apply cetain contingent perhaps constructed concepts to the world, no  more puzzling than saying a red light means stop.

RJBS doesn&#039;t say a talmudist has direct access to the noumenal world, nor does Kant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[chakira..Kant asked &quot;How are synthetic a priori truths possible?&quot; meaning how can we know sentences that are about the world without observation. Kant gives a very long winded answer to the effect that we necessarily impose certain forms on the world. RYBS in Ish Halacha hitches a ride on this  famous name and says that when a talmudist experiences the world   as when he sees a sunrise or  sunset  in halachic terms , he utilizes synthetic a priori truths. But all that comes to is that armed with halachot  he tends to see empirical events as associated with relevant halachot . The way he knows these rules to be true is by looking them up in a book and believing they are true. 

I say if there is a unique a priori event , namely the &#039;deduction&#039; of mitzvot from a set of intuitively plausible initial conditions then there is something to this RJBS claim that mitzvot are known  a priori..]]></description>
