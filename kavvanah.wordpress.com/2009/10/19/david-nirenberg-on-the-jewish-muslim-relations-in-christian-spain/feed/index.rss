					<description><![CDATA[I just heard David Nirenberg speak a few days ago here in Berkeley, he referenced this topic but was talking mainly about his upcoming work on the category of &quot;Jew&quot; as a political construct in Europe.
His dialogic approach to history in general is much needed and well done.  He takes 30 years of theory seriously, and tries to avoid the pitfalls that critics of historiography point out with respect to the limits of the historian and the genre itself
And now i just realized this post was from 2009 - I have no idea how I ended up here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Second, societies cannot be classified as tolerant or intolerant merely through the accumulation of “negative” or “positive” examples. Our understanding of the history of Muslim (or Christian) relations with Jews has to be rich enough to explain both the periods of relatively stable coexistence and the periodic persecution that marked Jewish life in both civilizations. &quot;

A well educated and fair comment that in today&#039;s polarized world is forgotten.   I must search this author and see if there are also studies during the times of Al Andalous, which interests me greatly as having lived and studied the Andalousi migration to the Maghreb and the building of a rather different Jewish/Muslim community relationship there (still evident to this day) it may be the best example of what is possible for this world of today.]]></description>
