					<description><![CDATA[Let me try and answer these many questions.
Blasphemy is defined as any hate speech against religion itself. 
Reform accepts Kants moral law so they are OK, He sees Reform Judaism as an Ockham’s razor applied to Mendelssohn. He thinks liberal Judaism as a positive phenomena to keep people within Judaism. From this volume, I don&#039;t know what he would say about Renewal and Reconstructionism.
He sees the State of Israel as secular and defining itself in national terms instead of the required covenantal terms of a universal natural law. (more on this in latter posts.).
He would not follow Klinghoffer because he thinks the anti-feminist position is based on a Christian reading of scripture; the Talmud wouldn’t lead to such conclusion. Novak actually has an anti-Klinghoffer article in First Things. 
Novak, following Saadyah, distinguishes between rational and ritual law. Rational laws are know by all, but ritual laws like pork, wine, gambling, Eucharist are ritual laws and are not part of the public sphere.
He assumes that if we put the various right wing believers together in a room, they will create a pluralism of working for rights for all. Unlike the liberals who only have self interest. .The goal is not to kill the sinners, but to create a public sphere where morals are cultivated. As you know, there are YU parallels to this kind of thinking. 
He does get out and speak to people on all sides. You just have to accept his answers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If our two categories are Covenental Religions and Immoral Idolators, does that mean we can start executing atheists who masturbate or cheat on taxes? 

If my Covenant says pork is prohibited, Ali&#039;s bans alcohol, Jim&#039;s bans cardplaying, and Milton&#039;s bans coca cola -- shouldn&#039;t we just ban them all to make everyone&#039;s Covenantal life easier?

Your work on Judaism and Buddhism and Hinduism certainly would come in handy here. But what about Scientology?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also wondering about how the Noahide prohibition of Blasphemy plays out. Does that mean the Reform Judaism is ok but Reconstructionism is treif?

For that matter, if we take the Torah prohibition of Adultery as the template for the Noahide prohibition on Arayot, can we use Natural Law to roll back women&#039;s suffrage ala Klinghoffer and National Review? That should play swell with the college kids. And if not, why?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What jumps out to me is his taking sides in the culture wars over America&#039;s self-definition (rejecting Jefferson) but having nothing to say about Israel. Trusting religious leadership to be benign seems very 20th century.]]></description>

She wrote the famous article on Abortion that was required reading when we were younger, right? Novak is not grappling with her thought. Can you offer a jewish reading of her work normativity? I dint have time to read it until the end of the semester.
Any thoughts of Novak&#039;s reading of his Jewish texts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read him extensively. But in the back of my mind I have the impression he is either a Straussian or hangs with them. 

I don&#039;t accept the premiss that the divine mandate is needed for a normative definition. It is the sort of claim you find on frum style blogs,

Check out or sample this lecture on Normativity  if you have the time and patience.

					<description><![CDATA[For Novak, definitions of human nature are of normative intent, and for him the divine mandate is needed for a normative definition. 

Yes, he pushes natural law. And the next book I discuss will be his book entirely dedicated to natural law. 
Be that as it may,  he has been very prolific in the last decade and people are starting to read the works and they are starting to find their way onto syllabi.
Most reviews comment on the political theory aspects; I want to explore his vision of Judiasm. 
He is also one of the stars of the Tikva Fund and their creation of conservative workshops on Jewish thought by the conservative Witherspoon Institute on Princeton&#039;s Campus.
They are running summer seminars for college students.

So help me analysis him.  let&#039;s take this apart slowly.]]></description>

Why is it that &quot;For Novak, liberalism that does not start with an absolute divine covenant does not allow a public sphere?&quot;
