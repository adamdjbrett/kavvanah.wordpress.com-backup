Are these non-systematic pre-philosophical &#038; pre-Kabbalistic raw materials to fashion a post-Modern post-academic Judaism that moves beyond systems while incorporating liturgy, midrash &#038; mythopoesis into a personal mythic Judaism?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who is writing on biblical, midrashic and zoharic myths on rain, I was caught by surprise by this article. Unfortunatley my surprise quickly turned to disappointment. Which is not to say this article is lacking merit, only that, as he himself writes in n. 42, “While the theme of the hieros gamos (“sacred marriage”) is related to the question of the precipitation process, the mythopoetic aspects thereof are not directly relevant to the way in which this question is posed here.” The way he poses the question therefore slices the material into two domains, the pseudo-scientific material, and more mythopoetic material. While there is some validity to this assertion it bequeaths him to explicate both how these discourses differ and the reasons why they are often intermingled in a single text. 
More generally I find his approach to be overly formalistic. And J. Rubenstein (“From Mythic Motifs to Sustained Myth; The Revision of Rabbinic Traditions in Medieval Midrashim”, The Harvard Theological Review, vol. 89, No. 2 (Apr., 1996), pp. 131-159)  has already argued for the same thesis regarding other 7th-8th century material, that they have no original material, but stylistically innovate by weaving isolated mythologumena into an extended narrative. And Rubenstein even uses these same rain midrashim to make his point!
I sense that my main difference here stems from our assumptions about the function of cosmographic rhetoric specifically in regards to rain. Rand claims that these are ultimately of theological importance, they seek to establish God’s awesomeness. I would situate this material within a more political context. The biblical texts on rain, irrigation and aquatonics seek to differentiate between meretricious lands that are abundantly watered from below (Egypt, Sedom, and Eden – see Gen. 13:10 and Duet. 11:9-11) and Israel, which is sporadically watered from above. Hence there is an ethics of dependency that drives the ecological discourse. Furthermore, its hard for me to imagine that the purpose of mythpoesis in regard to rain is ever descriptive and not productive. (Biblical) mythmaking thus shifts between a scientific and a technological function, at times explaining the oddity of nature, and at times providing unique techniques to control nature. This productive capacity is perhaps nowhere better exemplified than in myths surrounding rain; for the enigma of rain is not only how to understand its workings but more importantly how to ensure its arrival.]]></description>

Since most academics note the sexual basis of the image, the meteorological ones do not seem to have been noted.]]></description>
