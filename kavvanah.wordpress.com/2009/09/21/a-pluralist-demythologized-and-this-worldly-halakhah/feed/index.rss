Do you mean that only Nagen is trying to do a philosophy of halakhah from within the halakhah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that he is most like Nagen of the ones you mentioned.

From what you describe Sagi is trying to create something for the communities who keep Halakha. Not apologetics, like the pulpit Rabbis. But an alternative way of framing, talking about and living halakha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My understanding is that Sagi is not primarily interested in doing philosophy or advancing philosophic discources, informed by Halakha.

Are you comparing him to Yaakov Nagan? Moshe Halbertal? Pulpit rabbis who call their homilies a philosophy constructed from halakhah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My understanding is that Sagi is not primarily interested in doing philosophy or advancing philosophic discources, informed by Halakha, but is trying to create a model of Halakha for Israel or at least certain communities in Israel.

As I am not a member of those communities, I do not know if I would find it meaningful or useful. 

I could see how many in America would like to participate in some form a Halakhic community, but one that is pluralistic, demythologized, and this-worldly, such as those who frequent independent &quot;Minyanim&quot;. Indeed this could be an opening for the leaders of the Minyanim movement to move beyond their local service into a genuine movement.

I do not see how this &quot;Halakha&quot; could create a passionate Judaism that people would actively choose, but it could form the Wurtzberger-esque &quot;Floor&quot; upon which to construct one&#039;s Judaism, which &quot;chiyyus&quot; would lie elsewhere.]]></description>

Nu, so give me 500 words or at least 500 words on what does in fact contribute to the dialog.
Not a list of names or terms but an approach for a hermenutical age.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The invocation of Wittgenstein to justify an incommensurable language game and thus legitimize diversity grates on our ears as 1980s clothing grates on our eyes. No one is really interested in such aporetic half conceptions at this stage in the game. For those of us who have returned to hermeneutics and believe in the inherent understandability of these propositions across artificial and weakly constructed lines: Is there anything here in Sagi which contributes to any dialog?]]></description>

Sagi opens the book by stating that Torah is mostly not tolerant and pluralist. He even takes several statements often used to show tolerance and shows how weak they are and how they do not fit the modern meaning. He states that it might even be detrimental to adopt the pluralistic approach. But he concludes that for those who are already living in the post-modern world  - pluralism is the challenge that needs to be met. His approach is about &quot;could one&quot; create a theory? Can one find a way to accept the post-modern condition? He does not deal with constraints.liberal ethics is assumed. He has another book carving out a place for natural rational ethics, which for Sagi in our age would be Rawls, Dworken, pluralism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need some help understanding this , since I have yet to read the book. Suppose torah does not appear on the surface as pluralist or democratic or non-mythical. Does the move consist of reading the mitzvah with no context or background in the most narrow way (Leibowitz) and then adding on the desired value. What are the constraints on what can be added on...why is mechiyas amalek narrowly construed plus pluralist  democracy a better tziruf than the same  plus fascist imperialism?]]></description>
