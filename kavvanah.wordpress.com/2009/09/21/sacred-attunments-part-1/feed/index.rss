					<description><![CDATA[How does Fishbane deal with the Metaphysics?  

What is their ontological status? That would appear to address your concern about the use of Kabbalistic and Chassidic terminology.  

I suspect that most people in America who take theology very seriously are more in touch with themselves than the average Baal Habayis.

Your question about trusting oneself and being twice born is really a question about the nature of the religious lives of American Jews.  As most Jews these days, for better or worse, are born into communities, we do not have the extreme spiritual journeys in other communities.

Granted that there is plenty of &quot;seekers&quot; and people who spend their youth sampling all sorts types of Judaism, but most end up not far from where they started.

I think that a Judaism which encourages them to trust their intuition would help create healthier religious beings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The  connection with late Heidegger  is a clever turn; It says over the idea of hamshachas haorot which you find everywhere in chasidus in a nice way without using the energy concept, though you are now burdened with Being and its twists and turns.

I am less clear  and far from happy with this idea of getting in touch with one&#039;s self and being centered. First it assumes that a non fragmented cohesed self is not only possible but is somehow related to mitzvot...I doubt this. And even if there is a centered self it requires a half a lifetime of psycho-analysis and inwardness, AND a deep connection with one&#039;s body from the inside. Our most central experience of self is via body narcissism as anyone who has been seriously ill knows all too well. 

This easy conflation of self and sefirot/orot comes from thinking the phenomenological location of the sefirot as mental objects, or as abstract metaphysical entities, similar to  Plato&#039;s forms,  existing outside the body in some suitable heaven.]]></description>
