					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/john-t-elson-editor-who-asked-%e2%80%98is-god-dead%e2%80%99-at-time-dies-at-78/#comment-36&quot;&gt;evanstonjew&lt;/a&gt;.

I am not sure all the SBNR are looking for a body centered religion. I have met many of them and many want SBNR for inner piece.  I am also not sure that the body is tied into the John Elson trajectory. Elson and eclipse of God theologians seem to be independent, even if not disconnected, from the health food and body religion of people like 
 Dr. John Harvey Kellogg http://www.adherents.com/people/pk/John_Harvey_Kellogg.html
or Moshe Feldenkrais. Paul van Buren was not into connected his theology to a healthy body.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the situation in a somewhat different way. There is a huge number of non-Orthodox Jews who think of themselves as spiritual but not religious(SBNR). I would say  there are way more SBNR women today  than  active  Conservative,   Reform or agnostic  secular Jewish women . Somewhat less so with men.

These SBNR types are not all fools taken in by TV  preachers and the easy mysticism of Eckhart Tolle and The  Secret. The piece Jewish denominations are missing is the role the body plays in this new spirituality. Beginning with healthy eating, avoiding of toxins and pollutants and onto exercise and yoga, meditation,  breathing and Qigong, there is a counterculture in play that offers a substantive alternative to talk, whether chasidic or stamm rabbinic drashas. 

Jews no less than others find aging terrifying, as they should. And in the spirit of American pragmatism they attempt to find out what actually works in their lives. When the rabbis and scholars will become role models for  long and active sexual lives, flexible and strong bodies  and good all around health they will be able to talk convincingly of theism and its relation to ruchniyus. Until then it&#039;s mostly book talk.]]></description>
