					<description><![CDATA[Upon thinking over this matter, there is an elefant in the room of this, largely European, discussion, Islam and the rise of Islam in Europe in recent decades.  

Some have claimed that the relativism of European secular and religious thought cannot compete with the certainty of the Imams.  

By having the Head of the Catholic Church and the Head of the Jews strongly come out in favor of objective truth, they may be used as a counterweight to the Muslim minority.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps a historic truce has been brokered between the philosophers and the theologians, given that the enemies they share are much more pernicious than any proposition they will inevitably disagree on. As a corollary, there is a Habermasian quality to this: the Pope realizes that the normative underpinnings of any propositions are at serious risk from the erosion of a reasonable sphere of dialog. It may be more important to defend the conditions of possibility of dialog than to actually say any statement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s possible that both Ratzinger &#038; Sacks are playing public roles.  

They are the &quot;religious leaders&quot; who the chatting class can point to as someone who claims to have religious truths.  

Not that the average follower or Church goer ascribes to these truths.  But they play a role in the public square.

But in certain ways this is not what they want to be. They want people to adopt an actual truth.]]></description>
