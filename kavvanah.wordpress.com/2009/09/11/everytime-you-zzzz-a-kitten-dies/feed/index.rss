					<description><![CDATA[In the case of the niggun, one is appropriating something that is not a mitzvah. Here the mitzvah has a new reason. 
Rav Reichman in this case follows the Chabad practice.  Eighteenth century Chabad saw Napoleon as a danger, therefore they appropriated the French tunes like La Marseillaise.  
But even in the case of the melodies - is the reason to appropriate the tune in order to raise hidden sparks in the evil, or to fight the evil?
And how did the reasoning of the appropriation change?
In this case the formulation of &quot;Every time one does x, an x dies&quot; is not the same as the traditional &quot;gaining power over.&quot; ]]></description>
