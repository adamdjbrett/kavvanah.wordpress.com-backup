His writings actually embrace historicism with side stepping into theology. He was working on a theology of history using Polish Hasidut before his untimely death, there may be a surviving draft in his papers. But his BA thesis was on heilsgechichte in the Church Fathers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you are blurring sociology and theology. I am not sure that most people carein any group, even Satmar.
But there is a strong historical sense in MO, maybe I have seen more of it and need to bring example in future posts.  But there is something heilsgeschichte when i hear things like:
&quot;Zionism was founded by the Avnei Nezer or Chofetz Chaim and not by secular Zionists.&quot; [even though both were anti-zionist]
&quot;How can the reform movement still show its face and produce new books after the Holocaust?&quot;
&quot;Everyone in Eastern Europe used to follow the mesorah and do anything their rabbis said.&quot;
&quot;We are the ones seeking truth in history and do not create hagiography.&quot;[ followed by a factoid  that is not historically true.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was imprecise with my earlier comments. 

Of course the followers of Tzvi Yehudah Kook and the Lubavitcher Rebbes are animated by a historical theology which motivates their activities large and small.

But, in my experience, mainstream Modern Orthodox in America and Chareidim in Israel &#038; the Diaspora largely do not have a theology of history.   Though they could create one if they wanted. 

Do people need a strong historical consciousness to need a Heilsgeschichte? Chareidim, by and large, do not have an historical consciousness. 

As for the American Modern Orthodox, I spend less time around them than I should, but in my impression people are dismissive of Heilsgeschichte  the same way that they are dismissive of Slifkin.

Additionally, for much of the 20th Century the main concern was Halakha and its nature, which the America Orthodox tend to think of as outside history.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/orthodox-heilsgechichte/#comment-9&quot;&gt;Yonatan&lt;/a&gt;.

At this point, much of the discussion of mesorah, Israel, and Holocaust is deeply concerned with a theology of history. So I think now it is a major issue.
In the case of Rav Elhanan, it was less a theology of history and more a way to undermine the modernist post Graetz and Dubnow view of peoplehood.
The followers of Rav Zevi Yehudah are completely in a theory of history and politics. I see they respond in quotes given to newspapers about current issues and events using their history. If you think they are not concerned, then what would constitute being concerned??
what would make these lesser theologies of history that R. Yoel?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe that Rabbi Shimon Schwab zt&quot;l also wrote a Heilsgeschichte sefer.  It was republished and distributed at the KAJ dinner a few years ago.  (If you would like I can send to you a copy.)

My question is how central is these thinkers&#039; Heilsgeschichte to their overall theology and worldview.  In otherwords, how much did they care about history?

Additionally, how much effort did they invest in these efforts?

It is my impression that in general, compared to American Exangelical Christians, and in particular Premillinial Dispensationalists, Orthodox Jews are far less interested in History and do not invest as much effort in understanding either history or current events in a religious context.]]></description>
