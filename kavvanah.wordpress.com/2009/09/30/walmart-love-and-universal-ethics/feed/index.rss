					<description><![CDATA[The question is, how particularistic is Benedict&#039;s Catholicism? Does love have priority over commerce because God&#039;s love creates fraternity? In that case any faith community with a loving God can read the encyclical, and it is inclusive of Jews, Muslims and Protestants. 

Or is he claiming some unique function of Catholicism leads to his conclusion? In that  case he has nothing to teach the rest of us.

My guess is that he uses Catholicism as a synonym for religion, in which case he is addressing us as well.]]></description>
