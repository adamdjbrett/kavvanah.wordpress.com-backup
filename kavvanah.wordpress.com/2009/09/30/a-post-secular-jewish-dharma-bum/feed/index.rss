Which raises the question: What book of Jewish theology would you recommend for the curious nine-year-old?]]></description>

No objection to his work. I like the edgy 1000 word essays. The review was more description of a style. I do not think it is it too low brow, Alan Watts sufficed for many people their entire lives, and had his moments of lasting scholarship and enduring insight. 
I do not relate to the prison model enough to respond to it. I think more in terms of idealizations and richness of resources.  I am not sure the issue is right reason, there are a variety of reasons.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not clear where the core objection to Michaelson lies. Besides his dissipated style, is it  that he counts what there is in the world in a mushy sloppy way, or is it that he offers too low brow- too popular reasons for being Jewish?

The test for ontology these days is whether someone privileges humans over objects. Can  you  treat the stuff of the world with only human goals in mind; or no matter how many kinds of things there are, like who cares,  we humans are not more part of God than an ant? Both views, humans as the center, or a flat ontology where all kinds count equally, end  with unhappy moral  positions.

On the spiritual spin to theology I take it you have no objection to Orthodoxy or Judaism not being a hard prison. You are willing to accept a soft prison model without TMS, punishment and hashgacha pratis. What I sense is that you discriminate between the kind of utilitarian reasons acceptable as a reason for staying safely inside the walls of Orthodoxy. Is it that the benefits must be diffused or structural and deep beneath the surface or internal to the mesorah or what? And is the criteria for selecting the right kind of taamei hamitzvot aesthetic, moral or what?]]></description>
