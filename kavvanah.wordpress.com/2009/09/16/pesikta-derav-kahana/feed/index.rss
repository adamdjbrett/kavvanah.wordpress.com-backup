					<description><![CDATA[No one says you should swallow these ideas whole.
No one is swallowing the 16th or the 18th century whole. I await an anthology or conference for us to start asking these questions. 
But there is a quality about the 6-9th centuries that is already post-talmudic but pre-medieval that has a sense of wonderment for us. A book like Pirke derebbe Eliezer is like walking into an alternate rabbinic world.

As a side point, does academic in your question mean &quot;for antiquarian interest only?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From a non-academic perspective, does this world speak to a modern or post-Modern audience? Can people raised with philosophical conceptions of God accept or use these texts?

I personally find these ideas very appealling emotionally. These ideas may serve to create an emotional/aesthetic space similar to poetry, architecture, or music.  But something inside of me cannot swallow these ideas whole.]]></description>
