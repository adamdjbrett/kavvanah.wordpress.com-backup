					<description><![CDATA[I am not certain that I understand the difference that you present correctly.

If I understand you correctly, this Witnessing is a way of dealing with assimilation and maintaining group identity, while simultaneously keeping an &quot;openness&quot; to engagement with the larger culture.

However, the sociological reality in England, where there is still a distinct &quot;Jewish Church&quot; presumably affects how Rabbi Sacks views &#038; presents his role in society.

America is very different. Though, 19th Century Germany was much closer to England than America, but Hirsch, presumably, did not have the same relationship to the German Churches.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wiesel uses the term is a Sartre way as a courage to give testimony to the difficulties of life. I have the passages collected if you are interested.
Yehiel Eckstein has a unique double covenant theory, where we witness  the Christians as the Biblical path for gentiles. (I also have these collected).
Witness is not the same as light to the nations. The former is a closed message witnessed by a closed group and then offered to the world, while the latter is a universal idea.
Rabbi Hirsch is always the latter. Wiesel is not using the word in the same manner.
And this is my discomfort to find Sacks closer to Eckstein than to Hirsch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Arie on this one. 

Rabbi Sacks was educated in a classic English framework, so it would make sense for his to use their language to express his ideas, especially as he is always also speaking to the non-Jews.

Perhaps the position of English Chief Rabbi is unique of his role in the larger English society. In Americac do we not have a parallel. Though Rabbis Arthur &#038; Marc Schneier &#038; Shmuley Boteach have attempted to fashion such a role. I am curious about the language that Yechiel Eckstein uses in speaking to the American Evangelicals. 

But does recasting &quot;Ohr Lagoyim&quot; as &quot;Witness&quot; change or transform the term?

Also, is this a specifically post-Holocaust move. The survival of the Jews after the Holocaust, a way of doing post-Holocause theology without doing post-Holocaust theology. Does Wiesel also use the term Witness?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While on any given detailed point you are right that R&#039; Sacks is interpreting the texts in a way that differs from the the classical commentators, it seems like he is merely recasting the notion of being an אור לגוים in terms that his Anglican audience will understand. R&#039; Hirsch and others understood the notion of being a light unto the nations as actually communicating something to the nations, though that communication need not be a conscious, direct one.

Still, I do find that R&#039; Sacks&#039; witnessing or testifying may echo the doctrine of being a light unto the nations.]]></description>
