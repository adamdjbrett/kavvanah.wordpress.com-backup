					<description><![CDATA[As you know there is this Jew Bu phenomena...three books and 10 yidines ...they might argue the way you described. And there are the Zalman disciples who climb mountains Shabbus morning to meditate, they too would agree. But if you willing to put Boulder and Berkley aside, it seems obvious to me that you are correct...when  a Jew  practises yoga, it is just that, and not chassidus or Jewish yoga.

Nevertheless I would maintain  yoga would be of geat benefit to mekubalim and chasidim everywhere.Belz with yoga would be a deeper and more meaningful chasidus. And in such a world people would find new paralles and connections.

Here&#039;s one. Tantric yoga has similar views about motzi  zerah levatalah as Zoharic kaballah. The famous 16th century obsession with nocturnal emissions and the possibilty of wasting semen, which today is almost incomprehensible, takes on new meaning in the light of tantric yoga. Furthermore the large number of themes  in kabbalah  dealing with zivugim both below and above as well as the associated yichudim begins to become understandable in the light of a sexual yoga with real bodies. OTOH if you think of kabbalah as psychological you might agree with R. Green that E.  Wolfson places too much emphasis on sexual themes. 

How yoga will be developed if at all  remains an open issue for future generations of religious Jews. Who knows?]]></description>
