					<description><![CDATA[Why is it unfair to say that neo Hasidism is a Hasidism, if we see that Hasidism undergoes a variety of historical metamorphoses in its &quot;native milieu&quot; such as it was? Why reify real Hasidism as &quot;hanhagot, rebbe, etc.&quot;?
Is it the rupture of the holocaust that you are presupposing heavily, or is it your belief that you can separate out and create a criterion?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Buber was writing as a Romantic and Fin de Siecle orientalist, and he was received as that.
In the 1920-1960&#039;s - the new products were not treated as authentic.
But after the 6 day war and the Tel Aviv play &quot;Ish hasid haya&quot;, and the hasidic song festival we had a new phenomena. Song, dance, and story were taken to be authentic.  Many of those today writing about hasidiism from a BT haredi perspective got started with Wiesel or Green. There is a direct quest for authenticity. Buber becomes re-contextualized as authentic. Here the dividing lines are blurry and it opens questions of aura, patina, tradition, and counterculture. 
 As I ask people when they tell me they are &quot;hasdic&quot; because they sing and play guitar saturday night- who is your rebbe? which hanhagot do you follow?  In the post 1967 world, hasidism has become an alter-ego for modern Judaisms when they want to talk about emotions and music. 

Twerski will be very careful in his referent and thinks that these are stories to learn from whoever wrote them - this works becuase he also quotes Peanuts, Readers Digest, and pop-culture.  he calls them &quot;stories we can learn from&quot; and he does more mussar these days. 
Israelight on the other hand is teaching straight 12 step, the secret, Eckhart Tolle as Reb Zadok and Rav Kook.  They bank on being authentic torah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As an aside, why is there emphasis on &quot;authenticity&quot; when teaching Hasidism?

If Buber &quot;authentic&quot; Chassidism? 

Is Neo-Carlebach &quot;authentic&quot; Chassidim?

Is Twersky teaching Chassidus &quot;authentic&quot; Chassidism?

Is JACS?

If the criteria is whether they study and teach texts, for many Chassidim historically &#038; now, textual study of Chassidus is very marginal to their praxis &#038; Hassidic way of life. 

That may be an arbitrary scholarly bias in paskening people and movements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think our difference is that I think they do have a payoff, as does psychotherapy. For many people 12 step and a purpose driven life do indeed help them. My only problem is when it is treated as authentic hasidic teaching. My neighbor, Rabbi Twerski has an ability to use hasidic stories in his infinite number of self help books without claiming the stories and the teachings are the same.
On the Renewal point- the antinomianism is a side show for a community of many marginals. The point is the dividing line between a very free adaptation of Hasidism and then calling Americanism Hasidism. A creative davenology is one thing, back packing or journal writing as a form of Hasidism is another. The former is an outgrowth,, however free of the original, the latter is a not. (see my review in the Forward)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you on 12 steps as chasidus is silly. I also agree R. Green etc are talking and thinking about the original texts. And it goes without saying these people are scholars working leshem shamayim. I disagree with psychologizing everything and I believe if these Jewish Renewal movements are to get anywhere there must be real payoffs. Why? Because it is being combined with antinomian practice. Orthodox chasidim get a pass. Not these  guys. And to be honest I don&#039;t think there is a payoff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My suggestion for #1 is my favorite quote from Rabbi Y. Blau:

&quot;Never attribute to malice what can be understood as incompetence&quot;.

The whole conference sounds odd &#038; I am trying to understand why YU is involved.

If one substitutes &quot;pop psychology&quot; for &quot;self-help&quot; and &quot;New Age&quot; in #2 &#038; #3 then that is obvious. 

Many in Modern Orthodoxy treat pop-psychology, and self-help as obvious and therefore that is the cosmology. Most people will ignore the New-Age or any other terms and ideas that they are not trained to hear.]]></description>

Oh My. I was not talking about Art Green or Reb Zalman. No , No no, I was only talking about the various Jewish versions of Marianne Williamson, the Secret, or 12 step. When someone teaches those as as neo-hasidism, then I see it as some aura. I also see these pop-psych as Hasidism as completely translatable. They help people feel healthier and happier. But I do think Art and Reb Zalman are actually connected to hasidism.  So can we start this again?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is turning into a race to the bottom.

Whether this is avodah zera is a topic I expect you will talk about in the coming months in regard to Fishbain and myth. I personally am not bothered by anthropomorphisms, and I don&#039;t see how anyone of this ilk can even think of taking a Maimonidean line. 

I am fairly certain that Arthur Green &#038; Co. would not agree to  labelling  neo chasidus &quot; as giv(ing) it an aura, a patina, and a social function as something non-translatable.&quot; He believes that kabbalah language is meaningful only as a psychological folk language describing inner experiences, and not as a cosmology which is hopeless, or as an abstract idea or language with no specific phenomenological location. Scholem and students   refuse to be pinned down on this point.  Green might agree there are other technical languages in other religions that are equivalent, but I doubt if he would agree that ordinary English would suffice.  Even Zalman Schecter feels the language of kabbalah and the symbolic language of mitzvot are necessary for this gnosis. They all feel there are real secrets to be revealed. What these secrets come to are  more or less the shocking recognition that ain od milvado mamish. On your reading they are all peddling pablum and they don&#039;t feel they are.

My view is that I cannot tie the teaching into anything else. Do you lose weight? Eat healthier? Have a better sex life? How do you know you got anywhere?]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;Your question #2 is interesting. My view is that the teaching first has to be valid on it’s own, irrespective of prooftexts etc.  If I follow a neo chasidic derech what exactly is going to happen? How is such talk integrated with all else that we know about the mind?
Assuming the first hurdle can be cleared one then has to show how these truths require bedavka this kabbalah language. Could the same ideas be expressed in ordinary language?
Your question can be turned around. What does neo chasidus have going for it that is not already available in Eckhart Tolle?&lt;/em&gt;

To start at the end. neo-chasidism gives it a label as religion. And for those who need it  it gives an air of authenticity. But there may be nothing offered in content. People are not into Neo-hasidism for merging into God or mystical prayer. Can they be expressed in ordinary language? In most cases, the answer to start is yes, but then then when we think about expression then it is more complex. To label it as hasidism gives it an aura, a patina, and a social function as something non-translatable. What will happen? It depends on the object labeled Neo-Hasidism. I get to opt out of rationalism. I feel there is a bigger scheme beyond myself. I get to be emotive. I get to practice magic or Avodah zara as part of Judaism.
do you agree?]]></description>
