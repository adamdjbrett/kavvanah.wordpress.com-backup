					<description><![CDATA[I was at BJ one time for a Friday night service. What I saw was indeed very impressive, but not exactly as conceptualized in the article. The first thing I noticed was the theater in the round quality and the use of a string quartet. If every shteibel in America had the acoustics of that room and a similar group of talented musicians they could achieve similar effects with much less  than  a minyan of 500 people. This is a let out all the stops performance. If normal yekkish -litvish davening is like a German  lied this is Andrew Lloyd Weber&#039;s Evita or maybe even Bob Fosse&#039;s Cabaret.

A second thing that struck me was the change from the urgency and emotional punch of Rabbi Meyer&#039;s activities during the junta and the Save Darfur banner that was strung across the width of the synagogue. I am not convinced Carlebach and left liberal politics  are natural partners. This crowd didn&#039;t accomplish much in Darfur and I doubt if they will be much more successful in saving the planet. 

I also question whether the Art Green model of kabbalah describes what&#039;s going on. The davening is hugely enjoyable, I agree. If this was my regular shul, I would imagine after  davening I would be in the mood for a good meal with family and friends  or maybe a long walk with a lot of banter and schmoozing. Transcendence I would leave for some other time. I don&#039;t think my reaction is atypical.

Having made all these picky-picky comments I believe Conservative and Reform congregations have a lot to learn from BJ for all the obvious reasons.]]></description>
