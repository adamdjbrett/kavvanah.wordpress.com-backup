					<description><![CDATA[Based upon your comments, I could see Novack as compelling for Jews with a traditional conservative public oriented orientation. 

His rejection of halakhic formalism is appealing as well as his anti-elitism (in his rejection of Twersky &#038; Hartman).

It&#039;s not too difficult to argue for some form of Natural Law in Judaism. Novack just pushes the envelop as far as it can go.

Personally, I may not find what he is saying within the sources and I have a skeptical attitude towards natural law. 

Those without as strong an issue with use (or abuse) of sources and have an intutive sense of natural law could find this vision of Judaism useful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not sure that placing him a set changes anything?
Forget the Catholic readers, who are not as naive as you make them. What does this hold for Jews? Is it compelling? There are many thinkers that I disagree with that still have compelling visions of Judiasm or important answers to our lives.  Who among Jews would accept this view of halakhah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If one accepts Novak as Jewish thinker akin to Hartman, Soloveitchik, Berkovits, Heschel, et al. than this book is forgivable and can be viewed as a particular take on Judaism.

He is then part of both a long and a late 20th century Jewish discussion about Natural Law.

Presumably, this would go over well in a Catholic University.]]></description>
