					<description><![CDATA[Think of the angel causing widespread upheaval and change and then without our ability to see where we are being flung finding ourselves in a new reality. There can be no intentionality on our part, no consciousness,  and no foreknowledge. Our hopes will not yield anything. Nor can we hasten the redemption.
But the angel will reveal a new origin, a new beginning to start the process again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tragedy that is currently being played out in Jewish life is that the largest  group moves along with modernity, and  a second group much smaller but growing very rapidly has regressed to a premodern world. A third group has a foot in both camps and finds the experience confusing and a strain. 

In Hegel&#039;s philosophy of history as we move from one type of  consciousness to another, two things change, the ontology and the rules of inference. And indeed this is what we find in our little Jewish shtetl. Charedim have pre- modern rules of inference. They believe in rabbis and halachic reasoning to establish reality. And  to them that seems obvious. To those who live in the modern world these ways of determining reality seems absurd.

How would the big three handle this issue?]]></description>
