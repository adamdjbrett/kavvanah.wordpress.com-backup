It is famous that Scholem did not not know Arabic or About Jews under Islam.
Many of the points you make are also found in  Gil Anidjar, &lt;em&gt;Our Place in al-Andalus &lt;/em&gt; including the Azulai perspective. 
For those who need it, the Azulai piece is translated in  Haim Zafrani, TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF JEWISH LIFE IN MOROCCO 
And for Moshe Idel&#039;s perspective on Morocco, see 
http://sephardic.fiu.edu/journal/MosheIidel.pdf

Jake, Where in Morocco do you live?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This article is revealing on a few fronts. It shows the continuous bias of a scholarly community which still denies the aboriginal version of a tradition taken from a non-European context.
According to Abraham Azoulay, a foremost contextual Zohar specialist, the Zohar  was kept in the Dra valley in Morocco.
The Zohar tradition in the Moroccan context has a whole inner definition which transcends the boundaries of theological research done in the 19th Century German style by Scholem, Green, and their disciples. Because of the immense bond between Moroccan identity and the Zohar, such a study should go into anthropological considerations, without which even the outer layer of meanings would be lacking. 

The article also  makes me wonder whether what we are seeing here is a continuous act of appropriation through commentary overload, done by &#039;scholars&#039; bent on killing the spirit of a people through the outdated European dissection of their living traditions.  I think anthropologists would have at least the decency to sit and listen. The Zohar tells the story of the Moroccan Jews by showing how they viewed the universe, God, and the human journey in this world. It is a specific perspective which became the mirror of an entire community for centuries, revealing their spiritual identity and their own sense of values. The roots of the language found in the Zohar then surely go as far back as the community which carries it. That community&#039;s history goes from biblical times all the way to the Phoenician Aramaic speaking Empire of Carthages, and through the Mishnaic, Christian Unitarian, Gaonic, Talmudic, Andalusian, and post Andalousian periods. It is obviously why the Zohar shows the same itinerary.  In the case of the Hindu Vedas, noone questions the antiquity of the tradition, and accepts it has gleaned and grown from each successive generation. But in the case of the Zohar, it seems that the Israeli academic approach wants to avoid the original Moroccan context at all cost. Scholem fought hard to establish that the Zohar was written in Spain, trying to pull it by the hair into a European context with links to French Provence schools, and Gnosticism, as if Spain was not part of the Maghreb in the Andalous days.  
Nowhere do Scholem or his students seriously address the Islamic perspective of influence from North Africa to Europe, in the fields of cosmology and theology, how it became the background of the Crusades, which kick-started the integration by Europe of North African and Oriental cultural elements. The German 19th Century method of investigation, espoused by the Scholem school is typical in its cynical attitude toward the aboriginal versions of the traditions they study. The typical superiority complex of old Europe toward the &#039;uncivilised&#039; is almost transparent in their discourse which gives no consideration whatsoever to origin stories told by the Moroccans about their own Moroccan mystical heritage, celebrated and living until today.  The Zohar continued to be &#039;lived&#039; in Morocco long after pages from it were printed and being pondered.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LK - yes you are missing something here.
firstly, the assumption that since a collection of text has been printed and bound that it was composed to be presented thusly.  simply because we now have a printed edition of THE ZOHAR does not mean that &quot;it&quot; (whatever &quot;it&quot; is) was produced as such.

					<description><![CDATA[he could just lay out his historic, manuscript and textual proofs.

There are not enough proofs and one of his points is that the research into the proofs has yet to start. 
Little has been done on the textual level.
His first line of argument is - who said it had an author? Do books have authors
The Gaster approach is Idel, Abrams is trying to be more careful and avoid conclusions until we start the textual work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Foucault, Benjamin, Stock quotes seem to be unnecessary.

If Abrams is correct, he could just lay out his historic, manuscript and textual proofs and overturn existing theories of how the &quot;book&quot; of the Zohar came to be.

He could then set the agenda for the next decade, which would be microstudies of pieces of Kabbalah that ended up in the 16th century book known as the Zohar.]]></description>

I find your post unclear. What are you proposing? and how it is it different than the other options?
Did you thinks Abrams was explaining what it means?
What are the philosophic and hermeneutic issues?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Based upon your summary there are two issues here.

One is the history of the text and ideas of the book that we now call The Zohar. The other is the philosophical and hermeneutic implications.

Wouldn&#039;t just a straightforward history of the Ideas and Texts of the Zohar be far more useful and helpful to scholarship without an explanation of what it all means?]]></description>
