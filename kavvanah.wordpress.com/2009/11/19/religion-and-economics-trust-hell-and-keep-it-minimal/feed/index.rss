					<description><![CDATA[second question- absolutely not.  I do not think their work contradicts Glock and Stark that religion need to make demands and give rewards. 
American religion has a balance of trusting community and theism without public festivals that cut into work time. 

Humrot is entirely a differnet question. (I once looked into it for an event that did not happen.) first, many people use the word humra to discuss the lines between the community in the 50&#039;s compared to the 90&#039;s, or they use it to explain conflict when different communities meet, or as one of the few indicators of change.
Other humrot, internal to community, usually serve clear purposes for grid and group structure, or to demarcate a subgroup.  Like I said in answer to the the first question, I dont see people picking up Rosh Hodesh humrot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First question. Yes. Here we are on Rosh Hodesh Kislev and there are no shortage of traditional practices that would make one late for work. Almost anything on a weekday- like rosh hodesh and tisha baav has dissipated its ritual sense. Weekday ritual interferes with making money. We have to travel to have simhas beis hashoavah. Even on hag itself- nothing will be allowed to interfere with peoples sleep schedules so that they are in proper shape to get back to work.  Chronos and sacred time recede with opportunities.
I think that this is one of the dividing lines between Haredi and Modern, and between business oriented haredi from non-business oriented haredi.
For reform, special events have to be on a retreat, vacation- so the sucess of things like Bardin-Brandeis, and Wexner retreats.
What is a non-monetary oppertunity?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two questions.

Do you believe opportunity costs are used in deciding whether to go to shul, such that the greater the opportunities the lower the attendance? Is this true across the spectrum from Reform to Charedi? And does this include even non-monetary opportunities?

Second is the demand curve for religion downward sloping, i.e. the greater the price the smaller the demand? Chumras and the like seem to indicate an upward sloping curve. Barro and the entire tradition out of which he comes assume a downward sloping curve.
