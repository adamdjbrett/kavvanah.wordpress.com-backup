Ner Mitzvah veTorah Or (incorporating Shaar haYichud, the main text on hitbonenut) was reprinted thrice during the last Rebbe&#039;s tenure, in 1974 (Brooklyn &#038; Kfar Chabad) and 1979.  It wasn&#039;t retypeset until 1995; the 1949, 1974 and 1979 editions were all reprints from Lemberg 1858 and Chernovitz 1860..

The long drought I wonder about is from 1860 to 1949 - 89 years, no new edition, right through the period when the fifth Rebbe was trying to revive the meditative thread.  I guess he was writing his own material.

You say, &quot;I love the davening and the beauty of a minyan but Orthodox Judaism in my opinion does not embrace meditation (at least the kind we do) as an integral part of Jewish daily life.&quot;

I find great keys to mindfulness and powerful meditations of compassion everywhere in my davening. You just have to forget all of what you were taught about davening, and look again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In fact, a program very much like the Rebbe, z&quot;l, requested was instituted in America in the 1920&#039;s by several rabbis, most prominently Rabbi Morris Lichtenstein. He was offering something from Jewish tradition to those Jews who had become involved in Christian Science (very popular at that time).

					<description><![CDATA[I have practiced the Transcendental Meditation Technique for almost 40 years and have found that my relationship with G-d is even stronger and my Jewish roots are deeper than before. Transcendental Meditation is not a religion, it is a technique that allows one to become aware of the source of all creation. Every religion has a different name for the source of all creation. 
However, as Shakespeare reminded us,... &#039; that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.&#039;
I have also come to respect the fact that everyone has their own path to G-d.
So, we share what we know with others and if they hear us, good. If not, we wish them well and send them on their way. G-d knows what is best for all of his creation.
Here is an interview with an Orthodox Rabbi that offers a different perspective. Other opinions should also be respected.

Orthodox Rabbi speaks on his 9-year TM practice
by BOB ROTH on SEPTEMBER 8, 2010

Rabbi Abraham Shainberg is the son of Holocaust survivors. His parents were from Warsaw, Poland, and they immigrated to America through different routes before raising their family the Lower East Side of New York. His father served as Rabbi of the First Warshauer Congregation for 27 years. With the urging of his father, Abraham studied at the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School on Henry Street in the Lower East Side from kindergarten through high school, and then attended Brooklyn College at the Flatbush campus. 
“A lot of my friends went there,” he recalls. “We studied the Torah, and the more you study the Torah the more you live the Torah. Sixty of us started the three-year program to become an ordained Rabbi (Semicha) but only seventeen of us completed the program. A few of us became rabbis, but most became professionals or businessmen. We were always cognizant of our rabbinical training because it dwells in your soul. It never leaves you.” 
Ten years ago, Rabbi Shainberg heard about the Transcendental Meditation technique from a friend. As a practicing Orthodox Jew, he was cautious but intrigued. “I wanted to know more, so I watched some videotapes of Maharishi’s lectures. Obviously, Maharishi is not my rabbi, but every tape I listened to, everything Maharishi said, was exactly on par with the Torah. I couldn’t believe it. Not a word was off. This wasn’t ‘new age;’ this is the wisdom of the ages. Maharishi came to the same conclusion arrived at by the greatest rabbis.”
Soon after, Rabbi Shainberg learned the Transcendental Meditation technique, and has been meditating 20 minutes twice a day ever since.
“Looking back over all these years, I can say TM has led me to better prayer, better service, and to be a better Jew. I’m more on my path to God than ever.”
“Transcendental Meditation is not a religion,” says Rabbi Shainberg, “and it doesn’t profess to ever be one or take the place of one. It is a technique for you to go inwards and find your soul, find your silence, find your bliss as a human being—and become the person God truly wants you to be.”]]></description>

&quot;Bottom line, if we pool our efforts, would you agree that perhaps we can begin to revive the Jewish Meditative tradition??? Then we can have meditative retreats that are more synchronous with Jewish tradition.&quot;

Yes, and I hope that we&#039;ll see that begin to  happen over the next few years.

&quot;it’s unfortunate that we lost our understanding of the essential meditative contents of the core of judaic practice, all of the berakhot and the birkat hamazon, to single out the most obvious.&quot;

If we consider the Ariza&quot;l&#039;s approach to be authentic (as the Gr&quot;a and Rav Khayyim Volozhiner seem to have thought), then we haven&#039;t lost it at all.  We just need to make it more familiar and available to our fellow Jews.


Shalom wrote:

&quot;Jewish history to me is filled w/ people who meditated for sure (as R’ Kaplan z”l points out) but meditation as part of mainstream Jewish practice in my eyes has not been central to what an integral part of our pathway.&quot;

It has never been mainstream in the sense of it being practiced by the majority of Jews, and probably never will be.  But there will always be a small number of people for whom meditation will be an important aspect of their avoda and their avdut.

&quot;SO in the end I just feel I am not going to find a Jewish meditation technique so I sit in silence, learn, daven, try to be mensch and do mitzvot.&quot;

Isn&#039;t what you do &quot;Jewish meditation&quot;?  What more do you want or need?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Len and Shalom,
I have been meditating since 1975 and teaching Jewish Meditation (JM) in the light of neuropsychology since 1994, and I am becoming more and more convinced that it is possible, and indeed a desired goal, to revive a practical tradition of JM no less valuable than the Zen Buddhist meditative practices.
I just returned from a Vipassana retreat organized here by the New School of Psychology at the Interdisciplinary Institute of Herzliya for neuroscientists and psychologists. This was the first such gathering in Israel of scientists and practical meditation with dozens of neuropsychologists (professors and doctoral students) sitting in silence for several days. One major difference between JM (Jewish Meditation) is what to do after you Quiet the Mind (QM)  and Focus the Awareness (FA). I presented a poster session at the scientific part of this conference where I tried to use neuropsychological understandings of meditation to explain the various JM techniques available today. One of my contentions is that after QM and FA, the next step in JM is II (Intuitive Inspiration). One can find this in a wide variety of JM techniques from Rambam to R. Yitzchak Sagi Nahor, Spanish and Tzefat Kabbalists and Hasidic masters. What I trying to research is to what extent these practices reflect the surrounding cultural meditative influences – e.g. as I mentioned above Gurdjieff, Ouspanski and the Admor of Piascezna. To that I would the Sufi influences on RaMaK, R. Shlomo Aklabetz and R. Hayyim Vital as well as Ibn Tufayl and Al-Ghazzali on the Rambam&#039;s meditative mindfulness devekut directives. Bottom line, if we pool our efforts, would you agree that perhaps we can begin to revive the Jewish Meditative tradition??? Then we can have meditative retreats that are more synchronous with Jewish tradition.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Len I agree w/ you 100% and don&#039;t get me wrong I sit everyday. I miss R&#039; Lew a great deal and try to follow what he taught. My main point is that  sitting before davening in silence and stillness is not something most Jews do. I attend an orthodox minyan which I love dearly. I love the davening and the beauty of a minyan but Orthodox Judaism  in my opinion does not embrace meditation (at least the kind we do) as an integral part of Jewish daily life. Remember R&#039; Lew was a conservative Rabbi. I am not knocking anyone or anybody but my journey of meditation w/in Judaism has been a lonely one w/ many gifts and challenges from  Hashem. But I have experiened many frustrations w/in Judaism and especially from Rabbis when I broached the subject (Yiddish joke- Why did G-d create Rabbis? To confuse People!)  
I have had to look outside Judaism to find a &quot;technique&quot;. In the end it brought me closer to Judaism and davening and learning and mitzvot.  I do not know what  R&#039; Abraham taught as the Maspik does not explain WHAT he did but it implies he meditated.  I am sure the Ramchal practiced Hitbodadut but most likely Yichudim.  Yes a holy life is essential...but there are many Jews who as you know feel a yearning and search and search and become frustrated. I was oneof them.     Jewish history to me is filled w/ people who meditated for sure (as R&#039; Kaplan  z&quot;l points out) but  meditation as part of mainstream Jewish practice  in my eyes  has not been  central to what  an integral part of our pathway. Davening? Ideally meditation and prayer should go together  but every minyan I have gone to has the feel of what most people experience, beautiful and powerfull  but it is not a &quot;meditative &quot; expereince (at least to me). SO in the end I just feel I am not going to find a Jewish meditation technique so I sit in silence, learn, daven, try to be mensch and do mitzvot.]]></description>

SO in the end I just feel I am not going to find a Jewish meditation technique so I sit in silence, learn, daven, try to be mensch and do mitzvot.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[
Dear Shalom [Spencer],

Good to see you here.

I recall that we&#039;ve discussed these themes before.  

As you know, hoshkahta (coming to internal silence) is the ground from which meditation (both Jewish and non-Jewish) grows.

It can be used before t&#039;filla along with d&#039;veikut practices.  It can be used after t&#039;filla along with ho-rahdaht ha-sheffa practices.

And it can be used apart from the context of t&#039;filla to prepare for the meditation practices described in the sources cited in previous posts, that lead to hitgalut/ruakh ha-kodesh.

The main thing is to have a regular meditation practice, and to connect that meditation practice to the way of life that the Torah defines for us, to live a life of k&#039;dusha.  Meditation alone is not enough for a Jew, though it may be enough for non-Jews.


Although he first encountered hoshkahta in the context of Zen, once he returned to Judaism R. Alan Lew (z&quot;l) connected his quiet sitting practice to t&#039;filla, talmud Torah and Shabbat.  That&#039;s what he taught -- it worked.

My friend R. Alan Brill wrote: &quot;I tend to agree with his frustration. he is not looking for worksheets or 8 week classes, but a living tradition of daily practice that is as committed as we currently are to Torah study.&quot;
 
I&#039;d add that we already know what a steady Jewish meditation practice is.  Anyone who wants to can do it.  All it takes is the commitment.


As Khaz&quot;al said, if someone tells you there&#039;s khokhma among the non-Jews, you can believe them.  But if they say there&#039;s Torah there, don&#039;t believe them.  The Zen/Vipassana khokhma is sitting to arrive at internal silence.  As a result of it, they eventually experience an opening.

I have no doubt that Zen practitioners, Christian meditators, and many others get to the point of experiencing the very edge of hitgalut/ruakh ha-kodesh in what the Zen Buddhist folks call Kensho.  After all, Tana D&#039;vay Eliyahu and the Rambam say that ruakh ha-kodesh is potentially available to all.  But without a practice that leads to a state of k&#039;dusha, and without embodying the midot that Rav Avraham ben Ha-Rambam and the Ramkhal describe in the Ha-maspik and M&#039;sillat Y-sharim, it&#039;s unlikely that they&#039;ll get beyond the entrance.

					<description><![CDATA[The only inroads for those aspiring to connect to Hitbonanut maybe whatI have tried and think may work. Sit in silence and allow silence to permate one&#039;s consciousness to be totallly still . AT THAT POINT one can then use the ideas the Reshab suggets in Kuntres HaAVOdah, Tefillah, Etz CHaim and themes in Tanya (especaily Shaare Yihcud V Emmunah).  WhenI have preseneted this to Habad Rabbis they dismiss it as not Habad so in respect I gave up. To me a new pathway needs to be tried. One will not get advice from Habad SHlichim and even Rabbis. Silence is like the ground that is made fertile. The avodah and meditative content  is what we plant. The flowers and fruit are up to Hashem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr Ophir:

It&#039;s entirely likely.  The diary is that of the Previous Rebbe, so &quot;my father the Admor&quot; is the Rebbe Rashab, who tried to revive the meditative program of early Chabad, particularly through founding the yeshiva Tomchei Temimim, with limited success.  Naftali Loewenthal, in an article in Ada Rapoport-Albert&#039;s &quot;Hasidism Reconsidered,&quot; estimates about 10% of Chabad actually engaged in the real avodas hatefilla.

  One can hear contemporary Chabadniks talk about their grandfathers, who used to spend hours in prayer each day, but nobody today can do that any more.

  As mv&quot;r R&#039; Brill says, here and elsewhere, the Seventh Rebbe consciously removed meditation from the Chabad program.  I&#039;ve seen this in internal publications, too.  

In an article by, I think, R&#039; Levi Yitzchak Ginsburg (one of the big messianists) in Beis Moshiach a few years ago, he talked about the avodah (service, mission) of each generation being different, in response to someone asking about the old avodas hatefilla, and why we don&#039;t do it any more.  The Seventh Generation&#039;s mission was different from the Sixth, the Sixth from the Fifth, and the &quot;recent Seventh Generation&quot; (post-1994) is different from the Seventh, including more messianism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I  found the following quote on a Chabad website chabad.info/chabadpedia 
for the first day of Hanukah – as if someone here is recommending sitting for half an hour besides the candles in some form of meditative contemplation?
