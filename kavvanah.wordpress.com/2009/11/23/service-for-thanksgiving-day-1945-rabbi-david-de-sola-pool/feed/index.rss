					<description><![CDATA[I used to daven at S&#038;P on Thanksgiving morning when I was in HS and college, because they had a little breakfast, and then you could watch the parade from the porch of the shul (behind the gate, so you have to stand on chairs).  Mr Goldfarb, Scoutmaster of Troop 613 [Manhattan], was the shamash of the S&#038;P, so every year he invited the troop members to come and watch the parade.

They did not do this whole service.  They did not say Tachanun, and they would add the last 4 chapters of Hallel (Hallel is Ps 114-118), recited as tehillim, not as Hallel, i.e., without the repetitions that make it Hallel, after the end of Shacharit.  Rabbi Angel (Sr;  Jeff was a school-child at the time) would give a little speech at breakfast about the S&#038;P celebrating Thanksgiving since the very beginning, and Rev Gershom Mendes Seixas 40-page &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/23072657/A-Religious-Discourse-Thanksgiving-Day-Sermon-November-26-1789#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sermon for the first national Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; (1789).

One year they did say all of Hallel, but that year Thanksgiving fell on Rosh Chodesh.]]></description>
