					<description><![CDATA[While I haven&#039;t yet read the book, I appreciate your comments very much especially the description of what your students have gone through. If only people really new the true power of learning, which of course can only come out from an introverted perspective!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is always a range from extreme introversion to extreme extroversion with people falling all over the spectrum.

I also don&#039;t see why religion or religious leadership is any different from other endeavor or career. Often people do not have the temperment for their chosen career and either have to modify or change their career?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not buy that Jewish mystics are traditionally total introverts. There is an important social texture to many mystical experiences. Ramhal, for example, is the center of a mystical confraternity. He is not a lone messianic ranger. This is more true of Arizal and Safed, as you know, and may be the case for 13th century Kabbalah and the Zohar circle, as Liebes and others continue to argue. From a theurgic perspective, it is hard to see the mavericks effecting changes in the pleroma, and it seems likely that some intersubjectivity would be required for such a task, as this intersubjectivity constitutes the ipseity of the theurgically-effected process.]]></description>
