					<description><![CDATA[Didn&#039;t R&#039; Aryeh Kaplan do some pioneering work in this area, including also equating reaching for the inner recesses of the soul with reaching for G&quot;d? He justifies it by stating somewhere in his Jewish Meditation that through our inner recesses of the soul we do reach for G&quot;d.

evanstonjew, R&#039; Kaplan prefers a triple classification of Kabbalah, with the meditative being another track besides philosophical (the text thing) and magical/amulets, etc. kind of Kabbalah. An attractive typology.

Anyway, he does try to straddle the threatening gap between the esoteric-in-the-service-of-psychology and psychology-in-service-of-the-esoteric. He starts of with the former and ends up with the latter.

Disclaimer: since it is a popular book, one would easily miss most references unless one is reasonably acquainted with Lurianic Kabbalah and a number of other Kabbalistic traditions. He mentioned Sefer Yetzira and R&#039; Avraham Abulafia by name, but others get oblique references, too.

It would be interesting to pin down where he puts the outer limits of what can legitimately be called Kabbalah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At the level of cosmology, or as a model of some abstract space which might then be located as inside or outside the person there isn&#039;t much of problem. It&#039;s Kabbalah if it retains more or less the same structures that we find in the Zohar and the Ari,  the Ramak etc.. No two have the same details, but they do form a family of ideas and we think in terms of more or less similar. At the practical level there never were paradigms. Renaissance magic is connected to Kabbalah and rabbis flying around in a plane preventing swine flu by saying special words and sounds is also Kabbalah. Practises changed time and again.

 The practises I mentioned all use a concept of energy  that can be moved, a hamshachas haorot , which is a lot more than can be said for meditation. 
It&#039;s Kabbalah if knowledge of the Kabbalistic literature is useful in the  practise and if the practise presents a plausible instantiation of kabalah. Reading Shakespeare out loud  is not Kabbalah. Concentrating energy for different goals might just be close enough that we would be willing to call it Kabbalah. 

Your question in the end comes down to what we would be willing to say. The &#039;we&#039; is open ended enough that there is no one answer. As you know some used Kabbalah to explain the inner secrets of Christianity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/04/can-kabbalah-be-translated-into-a-modern-idiom/#comment-128&quot;&gt;evanstonjew&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;One very popular approach is Qigong. Qi, the natural energu that’s supposed to flow through us and around us, could be conflated with the energy terms in Kabbalah(e.g. shefah and nitzotzot).&lt;/em&gt;

So when is it no longer Kabbalah? Is there a point when it is illegitimate to still call it kabbalah?
Is there a point when we should just call it Qi and leave out any connection to Judiasm?
Can everything be called kabbalah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re running too much together. The Kabbalistic system itself is a text book sort of thing. You know better than I the relevant books, the history of the system, and so on. It involves more the experience of reading than anything else. Then there&#039;s this practical Kabbalah, which ranges from amulets to incantations, to kavanot, to meditation. If your question is how does pratical Kabbalah translate into the modern world, I think the meditative route is very long and shows few results for quite a long time. After all we&#039;re not going to go to a monastery and meditate for years on end. As it is used today it is primarily a stress reduction technique. 

For me the key to pratical Kabbalah and modern culture is in some combination of breathing and movement. The movement can be Tai Chi, yoga, Feldenkrais, etc., and the breathing is some attempt to focus energies through various breathing techniques. One very popular approach is Qigong. Qi, the natural energu that&#039;s supposed to flow through us and around us, could be conflated with the energy terms in Kabbalah(e.g. shefah and nitzotzot). These vast expanses that you speak of are also spaces within the body. 

In short I believe that in this world today mystical experiences have to involve body experiences.  Kemayes won&#039;t do the trick.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That would work in the 19th century when Bohme becomes von Hartmann, or even in the 20th century when Kabbalah becomes Erich Neumann.
But this new age language does not do justice to the kabbalistic levels of NRN HY. My question is when is the historical continuity broken?  I assume 12-step new age kabbalah has broken the continuum, but what about trans-personal psych. That is why I chose this article. It walks a line and does seem to be in continuity at some points.  But which aspects have broken the continuity?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An alternative reading could focus on the interconnection between modern psychology and its precursors in divine psychology. While some scholars have begun to probe the latent Oedipal dynamics of thinkers like AriZal, few have gone in the opposite direction, exploring how the grimoire of modern psychology may draw from the deep recesses of theosophic literature. Rather than exclaiming on the loss we feel as our texts are hermeneutically mutilated, we could celebrate their continuing relevance, and their coexistence on a self referential historical continuum with typologically heterogeneous but phenomenologically similar systems.]]></description>
