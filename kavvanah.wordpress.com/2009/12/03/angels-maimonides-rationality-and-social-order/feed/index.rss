					<description><![CDATA[Additionally, Prophecy and those who pursue it is anti-bourgeous. It rejects the status quo and encourages individuals to seek out the philosophical path against societies norms.

One could argue that Maimonides&#039; education agenda helps promote prophecy by having even the Masses reject &quot;superstition&quot; and create a culture of &quot;rationalism&quot;. 

As Rabbi Angel is coming from and promoting a bourgeous Middle Class Judaism, having prophecy would undermine the culture that he is seeking to create.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Marc Angel, following up on your earlier post, presumably prefers reading Jewish Studies rather than philosophy. Therefore, he is likely unaware of the problems with the term &quot;rational&quot;. Which makes his similar to most Rabbis who prefer reading Jewish studies volumes to philosophy, which is they construct theology based upon historical studies.

If I can be a bit naive, Angel is probably promoting a reading of Maimonides following his introduction to Perek Cheilek. I do not know if the Guide really plays an important role in his theology. 

Symbolic interpretations of amulets and magic would be acceptable if they were acknowledged to be symbols or psychology and theurgy  was explicitly denied when performing the magical or theurgic acts.

His Baal Habatim probably buy into the magic and theurgy without symbolism or psychology.

I personally don&#039;t find visions of Judaism presented by Angel or the Chait-niks (of which I have friends) particularly compelling. 

My question for Rabbi Angel would be his understanding of having a personal relationship with God. I have not read his book, but I would be surprised if he went all the way and adopted a full Maimonidean conception of God and man&#039;s relationship with him.]]></description>
