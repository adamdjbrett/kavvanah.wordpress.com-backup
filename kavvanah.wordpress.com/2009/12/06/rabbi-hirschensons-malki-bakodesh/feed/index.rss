					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;My mother gets into arguments with zealots of various stripes who insist that grape juice was always quasi-wine and needed hechsher. She remembers growing up in a kosher (if not particularly religious) household, where Welch’s was kosher, because it wasn’t usable for kiddush wine&lt;/em&gt;

Does she remember when the blessing was shehakol?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[do you have the same opinions about Rav Kook?
do you see value in his trying to limit the restoration of the Temple and Sanhedrin? because if dont how do you avoid those seeking to blow up the Dome of the Rock?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When reading Hirschenson, I am often struck with how dated much of it is. The shift from the national to the personal in Israeli yeshivot, and Chabad&#039;s non-Halakha-centric public religion make Hirschenson&#039;s problems and solutions vestiges of the past. The famous t&#039;shuva that appears in the Jewish Political tradition is also dated in that the need to qualify non-observant jews as &quot;truth seekers&quot; unable, at the current moment, to get past their questions is also problematic in 2009. If Chabad has taught us anything it is that &quot;authenticity&quot;, no matter how &quot;irrational&quot; or &quot;archaic&quot; ultimately has a stronger hold on Jews than any modern critique. Most of the non-observant should be classified as &quot;mumar l&#039;teyavon,&quot; and should be approached from that postion, rahter than the (naive, hopeful) projections of Hirschenson and Rav Kook.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why would you even compare them? This is one of my pet peeves that not everyone on the left or right is on the same side or doing the same activity.
Hirschenson is probably closest to Yehuda Maimon of Mizrachi or  Rosenthal of Kibbutz hadati or some of those sending letters to Rav Kook Like Moshe Seidel. They thought about the new state in terms of halakhah but did not want the Ultra Orthodox rabbis to be in charge of religion in the state. They wanted a democratic state.

At that time the Conservative institutions in the US supported the secular Labor party and Shomer haZair and did not worry about the re-institution of Kingship. 

You should read Golinkin&#039;s article on Conservative halakhah where he shows that, except for Louis Ginzburg, they were not into pesak. 
One of the most famous Conservative legal decisions of the 1920&#039;s was the permission to use grape juice for kiddish. orthodox rabbis did not accept it. But in the 1950&#039;s. this became the norm through Rabbis Soloveitchik and Moshe Feinstein. 
As a practice- mixed seating started then and it became the retrograded division between Conservative and Orthodox starting in the late 1950&#039;s.
But Rav Hirschenson had no interest in these aspects of popular practice. For Hirschenson, Americanization was the more fundamental questions of democracy, rejection of hierarchy, pluralism, and civil rights.]]></description>
