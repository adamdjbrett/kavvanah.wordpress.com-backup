					<description><![CDATA[evanstonjew
I just did a Rambi search hoping to update this post with some meager examples - some straws to grasp at- but I could not even find that.
It seems no one is interested.
This is my meager pickings:
Chansky, James D. Reflections on &quot;After Virtue&quot; after Auschwitz In   Philosophy Today 37,3 (1993) 247-256
Goldin, Owen Tamir, Rawls and the Temple Mount. In   Journal of Applied Philosophy 22,3 (2005) 289-298
And Hlary Putnam&#039;s new book on Jewish Thought. Anyone got any others?

					<description><![CDATA[They all should have been utilized to some degree or other, especicially 1,2,3,5,6b, 10 and 14. 11 is interesting for the concepts of a chalos and kavanah.6a, 12 and 13,  if you are interested in life after death, which no one seems to talk about. 14 can be used in many cute ways but is not essential. In the runner ups Feyerabend, Rorty and Taylor are very important. 

Tto the best of my limited knowledge none have been utilized except as part of a name dropping three card monte. That is the reason imho Jewish theology is in the sad state that it&#039;s in.I feel the right way to go is to study philosophy until you know your way about and only then begin thinking about a Philosophy of Torah. Hermann Cohen can wait for the golden years. 

These philosophers are SOME of the stars of the last century. Equally important is to stay in tune with the thought of this century. Consciousness is changing quickly. The new perceptions and modes of filtering experiences will eventually make their way to Jewish philosophy, maybe by 2050-75.]]></description>
