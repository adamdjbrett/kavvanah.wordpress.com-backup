You are using the world theology for worldview. And certainly it has not been elevated to the level of text. Fishbane loves Torah and wants feelings elevated to Torah.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I disagree with Fishbane&#039;s point that most Jews do not have a theology. If you press most practicing &#038; believing Jews you could pull out a theology from them. It may not be rigorous or especially rooted in his choice of texts, but they do have an underlying theology.]]></description>

Hermeneutics is never about doing. Which thinker of the hermeneutic tradition is concerned with what do I do next?

What do I do is an ethical question, not a hermeneutical one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He seems to be doing two questions.
How to awaken a presence of God?
How to renew Jewish theological thinking?
The url was to the rosh hashanah post on Fishbane and seems to fine. Do you have a copy of the work? Do you have the new Boyarin?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The url doesn&#039;t work on my computer, so I am not clear what is the problem for which Fishbane is trying to provide an answer.

Why be frum? Why be a Jew? Why live a Jewish life? What is a Jewish life? What is (was)  Judaism ? What is the future of Jew and/or Judaism? I could go on for a while.]]></description>
