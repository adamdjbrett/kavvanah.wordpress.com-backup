					<description><![CDATA[Wow. I find the original interview very culturally informative. But how does the shift of Evangelical forms of religiosity towards public fields of service relate to the Habermas-Benedict conversation and the more recent forum at NYU (with Habermas, Taylor, Butler, and West) on religion and the public sphere?]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard variants of the 12 step as an approach to teshuva.  Given that I&#039;ve heard few rabbis with any sort of consistent coherent approach, variants may be the best to expect.

Regarding the idea of &quot;powerlessness&quot; I think Torah focuses on the inner strength of people.  For example, compare Romans 7:20 &quot;Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it&quot; vs. R. Yohanan in name of R. Bana&#039;ah B A.Z. 5b, &quot;: Blessed is Israel; when they occupy themselves with Torah and acts of kindness their inclination is mastered by them, not they by their inclination.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But you were not taught to make 12-step language  as part of your Judiasm  There are Jewish self-help books out there that explain Jewish prayer, halakhah, and the meaning of Judiasm as 12 step. The point was not the treatment or substance abuse but the creation of a new language, a new spirituality, and a new goal. 
There are various books that present Judiasm as some form of &quot;we are all turkeys under the table&quot;  based on a breslov story. The 12 step language becomes a real shift when someone starts using it. Look at the 12 step list. We have to pray to God to remove our defects and leave all decisions with God.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bekhavod - I must point out that when I was in smikha YU ran a full day Yom Iyyun for Rabbis and smikha students on the very topic of substance abuse in the Orthodox community.  This must have been done in either 1999 or 2000.

From what I recall R. Tendler discussed the issue from a religious perspective and there was also an assistant D.A. from Brooklyn who covered treatment options.

I&#039;m sure there were others who spoke on various issues as well.]]></description>

Shmuel- On your first question you will have to tell me. I do not know their constituency or their long term vision. On the second, the engaged yeshivish world did very well the last 20 years in embracing AA, new age, 40 ways to happiness, personal narratives everyday miracles, and the creating of an entire section of Jewish bookstores of Jewish self help. The outreach branches embraced many aspects of the Pentecostal message, despite the descend of some of them to become Elmer Gantry. Whether they will reach the new era of gen -y, I do not know, time will tell. On the question of why, if I understand your question, was Centrism&#039;s greater dedication to creating enclaves with clear grid and group lines of demarcation. They were not interested in personal narratives, which are important in American religion. As one senior YU person once told me, they once went to city to do outreach with representatives of other yeshivot. The YU person was proud of the fact that the YU participants all gave a good shiurim while nebach the other participants did pop psych. I am not advocating it and I dont go for this pop-psych everyday miracles stuff but it played well in the 1990&#039;s.]]></description>
