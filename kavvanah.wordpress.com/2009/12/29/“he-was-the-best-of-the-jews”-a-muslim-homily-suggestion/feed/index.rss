					<description><![CDATA[I was not aware if this account and it is encouraging. It fills in a missing part of the picture and makes sense to me. This sense that Islamic hegemony &quot;goes&quot; is so destructive! On the one hand affirming all the prophets and even declaring they are equal, and on the other hand putting the Prophet Muhammad over and against all the others! It is good to hear an historical account in which we have a Jewish appreciation of the Prophet Muhammad -- and Muhammad&#039;s acceptance and appreciation of Jews as Jews. May this message spread wide and far!]]></description>
