					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/post-is-the-name-of-a-breakfast-cereal/#comment-309&quot;&gt;Grey&lt;/a&gt;.

I actually like the terms romanticism, magical realism, post-modernism, post-liberal. And I accept the variations in definition and that they function as cluster concepts.
And I do not expect people to correctly write about the time that they live through. But my peeve, which you might not share, is more of the case of the 1960 &quot;we are modern therefore we eat out&quot; use of the term that does not allow a proper description of the social issues of the day. And when it comes to issues of rights - to just call &quot;civil rights&quot; or &quot;human rights&quot; as modern loses the force of the argument.  Or if one champions full GLBT equality, to call it post-modern, lessons the argument.
Ordinary people do not throw around magical realism, it is thrown around by someone that is trying to approximate an academic understanding or weakly applying what they learned in class to inappropriate situations. Many of the other terms are used by those grasping at terms without any starting core of reference or attempt at approximation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what the criticism is here. Are we all angry at people throwing around terms that conveniently mean nothing to them? Lots of people I know hate when people say &quot;magical realism&quot; but even if you can talk constructive about it, that&#039;s still what it&#039;s called. Are we against terms naming time periods instead of describing them? Terms like , say, Elizabethan, or Victorian, or any names of those literary periods where a specific confusion and uncertainty seems to prompt artistic responses so diverse that even today we have trouble tying them all together? In art history you have the Rococo and Baroque and other names where people still debate what the damn etymologies could be.

Postmodern as a term has been around for at least sixty years, and attacks against the term itself have been around in print and from the back of the classroom for decades. After all this time, to criticize people for just using the word is a bit unfair. To take people to task for not understanding the historical period &lt;i&gt;that they&#039;re living through&lt;/i&gt; enough to label it appropriately might be even more unfair. A CUNY PhD student has a hard enough time explaining what Modernism is to a class of undergrads. I guess we should settle for better, but blaming everyone else (so it seems) for not having arrived already doesn&#039;t make much sense to me.]]></description>
