No, not at all. If you want that then go to A.A. Halevi, &lt;em&gt;Sha&#039;arei ha-Aggadah&lt;/em&gt;  (1963) or Hasan-Rokem. The book is on rhetorical styles-not images or tropes.  It points out the role of Roman satire in a in a broad way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought some figures in Greek mythology  have their counterparts in Midrash or Aggadah.

On example is Cerberus, the three headed dog that guards the underworld.  My guess is that is like the 3 sons of Korach saying “Moshe emes v’toraso emes&quot; at the entrance to gehennom.

Is this the type of thing this book discusses?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Isn&#039;t the distinction between two type of Aggadata a bit artificial? Could I argue for a range in Aggadah from the more sermonic/drasha to the more magical, with extremes on both ends?

2) I believe that the primary reason that people do not discuss Aggadatah within it&#039;s Roman context is because most people these days (even in Liberal Seminaries) lack a good Classical education. You cannot see what you do not know.  This could be seen as part of the larger turn to Jewish studies from philosophy and classics, which is a recurring theme of this blog.

Even if the teachers in Liberal Seminaries know the Classics and their context for Rabbinic literature, I suspect that their students would be less engaged by this comparison as opposed to developing the Jewish narrative arc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[boyarin had a good ear for explaining specific nuances in aggadic materials. it would be disappointing if he lost that ear now. also talmud, whether in the legal or the narrative genres is not to be confused with the codified halakhah. or to put it more bluntly, talmudic man should never be confused with halakhic man. the former views the world through rich legal and narrative modes of thought and the elaborate contents of that culture. the latter sees existence through a reorganized and restated subset of that material. and both talmudic man and halakhic man are amalgamated and partial archetypes within judaism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, Explicitly not as far as I know but there does seem to be a sense that some aggadot one does not bother explaining and some one is compelled to explain. The distinction is more of a heuristic tool than an actual distinction. For example, Rav Soloveitchik had no compunctions about not using the magical statements even if they are from Halakhic authorities.

evanstonjew- the medievals did not give much attention to these aggadot. Attention was turned to them from the 16th century onward in eastern Europe. The Beer Hagolah of Maharal turns every statement about Fat Rabbis and other carnival idea into a pillar for understanding the Talmud.   This continued for 300 years producing books such as &quot;midrash peliah&quot; and then culminating in Rav Nahman and the Gra both diving to explain these stories and giving divergent explanations to the same tales. For the last 200 years, these stories were not in fashion. Boyarin&#039;s approach has resonances with these eastern European thinkers.]]></description>
