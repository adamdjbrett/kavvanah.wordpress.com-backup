					<description><![CDATA[It still seems to me disingenuous to gloss over the editorial issues as well as the Sassanian context especially when Boyarin is fully aware of the the issues involved.

Additionally, if a studnet just gets a snipet of Talmud as part of class in Rhetoric in late antiquity it is quite likely to have a very distorted view of the BT and how it operates.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He claims everything in that era is to be considered Roman, the way globalization is American. He is doing BT. 
He is not interested in redactors or editors but in the rhetoric of the book. He is treating Talmud the way we teach Homer w/o worrying about editorial hands.

If his book is successfully received with a positive review by Harold Bloom or Stanley Fish then it might lead to the Talmud being included in core curriculum and survey of ancient classics. You will have English teachers adding Talmud to the core classics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am curious that the point that the Bavli was not in a Roman but a Sasanian context does not seem to be addressed. Especially in light of Jacob Neusner&#039;s &#038; David Kraemer&#039;s position that the editor/redactor of the BT had a heavy hand and has to be assumed to have reworked everything.

Is Boyarin limiting himself to Palestinian texts? 

Or is he seeking to extract the Roman roots from the BT?

It appears to me that the dialogic nature of the Talmud is more in a Persian than in a Roman context.]]></description>
