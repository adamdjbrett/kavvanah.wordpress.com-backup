				<p>Interviews with Chief Rabbi di Segni  from January 12, and 14.</p>
<blockquote><p>In an interview with Reuters ahead of this Sunday&#8217;s visit, Rabbi Riccardo di Segni also said he hoped the event would help combat hostility towards the Jewish world and intolerance of any religion.<br />

INTERVIEW &#8211; Only God can judge Pius XII on Jews &#8211; chief rabbi</a><br />
By Philip Pullella<br />
ROME (Reuters) &#8211; Only God can judge whether wartime Pope Pius XII did enough to save Jews and whether he should have spoken out more forcefully against the Holocaust, the rabbi who will host Pope Benedict first visit to Rome&#8217;s synagogue said.</p>
<p>Di Segni was asked about a Vatican official who defended Pius &#8212; who became pope on the eve of World War Two &#8212; from accusations he turned a blind eye to the Holocaust.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it can be morally dangerous and, religiously speaking, dangerous to say that the will of God is to be silent and not to say a word in front of the suffering of the people,&#8221; Di Segni said, speaking in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;So let us be careful and let us not (look for) a way of absolving people. I think only God may understand if people have done His will righteously, not us,&#8221; he said.&#8221;Religion now has a tremendous responsibility in bringing either war or peace to the world. So a signal of peace and friendship starting here from Rome could be very important,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Jews we want to say very strongly that any kind of hatred against difference, and not only against the Jews, has to be banned, has to be condemned,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another Interview in Catholic News Service</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000121.htm"><strong>Rome</strong><strong> rabbi says pope&#8217;s visit shows commitment to dialogue</strong></a><br />
Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, the chief rabbi, told <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/">Catholic News Service</a> there is &#8220;a solid basis&#8221; for positive relations, but &#8220;with a storm every now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Times have changed,&#8221; the rabbi said. &#8220;Many things have been achieved; other things still need to be done. The path, the Jewish-Catholic encounter, is terribly complicated. It is not a smooth road leading onward, but it is one continually filled with stumbling blocks. The visit of a pope to the synagogue should demonstrate that beyond the stumbling blocks there is a substantial desire to communicate with each other and resolve problems.&#8221;<br />
As is often the case, he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s hardest to establish good relations with the person closest to you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/135563">Side point on Bnei Akiva</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bnei Akiva’s local representatives said they decided to participate after hesitation and followed the advice of Rome&#8217;s Chief Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, who said that the visit was a sign that Pope Benedict wanted to &#8220;continue the dialogue.” He advised Bnei Akiva that the pope should be “respected as a king.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni (1949-) the current chief rabbi of Rome offers a unique take on the dialogue. He assumes that both sides accept exclusivism, so to go forward we have to affirm pluralism. Ever the gadfly, di Segni writes that the Jewish tradition follows the exclusivist and anti-Christian counter-gospel narrative of <a href="http:///jewishchristianlit.com/Topics/JewishJesus/toledoth.html"><em>Toldot Yeshu</em>,</a>  on which he wrote his doctorate <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16319665">and then published as a book.</a> For di Segni, Christians must recognize that the derogatory exclusivism <em>Toldot Yeshu</em> is the Jewish tradition, and this corresponds to the anti-Jewish narrative of traditional Christianity. He ponders that the Christian Trinity may actually be idolatry and violates the Noahite law that requires monotheism. If Christians violate this law, according to deSegni, they will not find salvation and are, furthermore, deserving of death in this world.</p>
<p>Noahite laws may be incumbent on gentiles as a form of general revelation but, Segni asks, if we took that seriously then wouldn’t we would have to be missionizing for these laws? So too, Christians if they should take their own faith seriously, should advocate missionizing.  Rabbi de Segni proposes therefore that both sides call a moratorium on truth claims and missionizing. It is not that either side should actually give up their truth claims, or their exclusivism, or to stop hoping for the conversion of the other, but simply a practical moratorium, a practical pluralism.</p>
<blockquote><p>The real problem is not so much the Church’s conviction of the necessity for the Jews to be saved by means of Jesus. The real issue is what is done with that conviction. If we were to apply the system of Noahide laws to the latter, we would have to do everything possible in order that the Noahides observe them—including the law dealing with the prohibition against worship of other gods. Each person would have to become a missionary of the pure faith…</p>
<p>On the Jewish side, this movement would have to be matched by an affirmation of the principle that faith in Jesus (understood: on the part of Christians, not Jews ) is not incompatible with the worship of the one and only God. This is a principle which has been accepted in authoritative traditions within Judaism, but which would have to become more prevalent and accepted by the majority. From this would have to follow, on the part of Jews, a greater understanding of Christian Spirituality.</p>
<p>Moses Maimonides, in the rules he gives for kings in his treatise (Chapter 11), after having denounced the invalidity of faith in Jesus, nevertheless formulated an interpretation of the providential significance of the spread of Christianity, “to prepare the road for the king-Messiah, and to help the whole world become accustomed to serving God together, as it is said, ‘At that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord’” (Zeph. 3:9).</p>
<p>Perhaps the parallel suggests the solution, which cannot be immediate but eschatological. Each of us has the right to hope that the other will acknowledge that there is true faith in us, but we allow for that to unfold over a long period, which is beyond our control.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sidic.org/en/DocOnLineView.asp?class=Doc00047">Read full version here</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Rabbi De Segni argues that we keep our particular truth claims but suspend acting on them until the end time. Since we have no common ground for discussion if we put our truth claims first, let us avoid the question and deal with ethics and practical matters.He frames questions as an exclusivist and then answers as a pluralist. Unlike other thinkers, De Segni values diversity over dignity, he emphasizes religious exclusivism and prejudice and then calls for charity.</p>
<p>Rabbi de Segni does work toward theological charity by building on Rabbi Yaakov Emden’s acceptance of Jesus as a great teacher who did not want to harm Judaism, and therefore legitimate for the gentiles since</p>
<p>In the end what counts is human responsibility. In the human realm, both faiths are called by God to work in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As he left the ark, Noah received the assurance that humanity would never again be entirely destroyed by God.</em> Now, however this risk still exists—not destruction by a divine hand, but by a human hand with no guarantees other than our own responsibility, which we (especially as religious) cannot escape. Commitments and facts must come before forms and ceremonies. This is the authentic message of the prophets, which we recognize as a common source, and the comfort promised by the divine mercy will recall once more the waters of Noah, no longer as a sign of destruction, but as a sign of protections. <strong><em>As the prophet Isaiah says (54:9): “This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>di Segni sates that there is no need for Jews to change their current prayer because they have already been censored, but he claims that they were self-censored. </p>
<blockquote><p> Jewish prayers have already been self-censored, centuries ago,&#8221; Di Segni informed the prelate in a communiqué. &#8220;What has been brought to our attention once more is a history of polemics which goes back thousands of years, concerning which some clarifications are in order. Anyone can hear for themselves the prayers which Jews recite today, and they can easily be verified, even in translation,&#8221; Di Segni emphasized. &#8220;The essential fact,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is that today no reference to Christians exists in our prayers, which, among other things, have been the object of repeated interventions of censoring and self-censoring. The Hebrew texts were changed centuries ago.<br />
<a href="http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/themes-in-todays-dialogue/good-friday-prayer/468-messaggero-08mar9">full version here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Di Segni thinks that dialogue is important but he does not think that <a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-9149?l=english">Judaism can change through dialogue.</a> &#8220;There has been notable theological progress in Christian theology&#8217;s view of Judaism”  However, &#8220;reciprocity at the theological level does not exist,&#8221; the rabbi said. &#8220;Among politicians there can be discussions that lead to a solution, not so among theologians.&#8221; &#8220;Christianity is born from Judaism and, with notable efforts, can introduce elements of Jewish spirituality,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The contrary is not possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Side Point: <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143045.html">Rabbi David Rosen in Haaratz</a> on the poor behavior of Jews toward the Vatican.</p>
<blockquote><p>Israel&#8217;s behavior toward the Vatican over the past 15 years has been &#8220;outrageous,&#8221; one of the figures behind the 1994 establishment of diplomatic relations between Jerusalem and Vatican City told Haaretz last week. &#8220;Any [other] country would have threatened to withdraw its ambassador long ago over Israel&#8217;s failure to honor agreements,&#8221; Rabbi David Rosen said.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Demystifying Kabbalah For English Readers</strong><br />
By Alan Brill Published January 13, 2010, issue of January 22, 2010</p>
<p>The Zohar 5: Pritzker Edition, Volume Five (With Translation and Commentary)<br />
Translated by Daniel C. Matt, Stanford University Press (Pritzker edition), 656 pages</p>
<p>A River Flows From Eden: The Language of Mystical Experience in the Zohar<br />
By Melila Hellner-Eshed Stanford University Press, 488 pages, $60.00.  </p>
<p>The Pritzker translation of the Zohar into English by Daniel Matt — the fifth volume of which has just appeared — should be greeted as a major cultural event. Yet, the publication of each volume has typically produced tiresome book reviews on the ownership of the word Kabbalah, comparing the academic approach of Gershom Scholem to Madonna’s New Age approach. The reviews do not answer the basic question: Why read the Zohar? Nor do they explain why the Zohar speaks to our age more than the myriad other kabbalistic works. </p>
<p>Melila Hellner-Eshed, in her book, “A River Flows From Eden: The Language of Mystical Experience in the Zohar,” provides an indispensible work that, finally, explains why the Zohar is an important and alluring work for our time. Susan Sontag taught readers to ask not what the art means, but rather “how it is what it is.” Hellner-Eshed follows Sontag and seeks to offer an experiential aesthetic of the Zohar.</p>
<p>Hellner-Eshed’s book is comparatively easy to read, despite being a scholarly work that assumes the reader has already read the terse prose of Scholem. Her work offers the nonacademic a chance to see the current state of Kabbalah study at Hebrew University among the students of Yehuda Liebes and Moshe Idel.</p>
<p>Liebes, who was Hellner-Eshed’s dissertation supervisor, claims that the Zohar was produced by a group similar to the group of mystics described in it. Accepting this approach, she muses “Who is this Rabbi Shimon who emerges from the quill of the Zohar’s composers?” Is he fictitious, or a legendary embellishment of a real historical person? Or maybe he represents the authors’ ideal figure? To these questions, she concludes: “There are of course no easy answers to these questions and perhaps this is as it ought to be.”</p>
<p>Hellner-Eshed’s book seeks to capture the life of the group of companions around Shimon, the stories of their wanderings and journeys, their study of Torah as a mystical quest and, finally, a description of their mystical experience. The book needs to be read cover to cover and then reread to integrate the concluding descriptions of mysticism back into the stories. This is because stories, experience and wisdom are not separate commodities for the kabbalists. </p>
<p>In Hellner-Eshed’s presentation, the companions around Shimon spend their time revealing the secrets of the Torah to each other as a collective form of mysticism. Instead of the usual reductionist discussion of sefirot (emanations of God), we are shown how the Holy Spirit pulsates within the companions of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. We also meet wondrous characters — old man, young child, donkey driver — who reveal ancient secrets to the companions.</p>
<p>The Zohar’s name originates in the biblical verse: “The enlightened will shine like the brilliance (zohar) of the sky&#8230;” (Daniel 12:3). Hellner-Eshed shows how the image of light is used to indicate the presence of a God in the Bible and in rabbinic literature. The Zohar, in turn, expands the metaphor to include variegated colors and mixings of shades, and combines light metaphors with those of fragrance and fluidity. Her own book draws its title from another of the Zohar’s central images, the superabundant divine plenty portrayed as “a river [that] flows from Eden.” Hellner-Eshed does not treat this imagery as mere metaphor, rather as a description of the mystic life of the companions engaged in nocturnal entrance into the Garden of Eden. When there is an awakening by the mystics below, then there is a parallel awakening from above, shown as a river of divine plenty.  </p>
<p>The Zohar portrays the experience of God as ecstatic delight through kissing, embracing and even intercourse. Hellner-Eshed’s original conclusion is that the mysticism of the Zohar describes the experience to be like a wave of water or A scent, where one enters into a period of heightened consciousness, sensuous pleasure, altered time frame and intuition of the secrets. According to Hellner-Eshed, there are three mystical states in the Zohar: when one drifts in and out; when one is “in the zone,” like a dancer or sprinter, and white light — a deep mythic level in which one enters into being itself. One can — using the terminology of less poetic scholars — call them shekhinah, tiferet and keter, but after Hellner-Eshed’s evocative exposition, that would show a tin ear for the drama. </p>
<p>Hellner-Eshed claims that the Zohar’s style is deliberately exaggerated and rhythmic to capture the experiential mood through trails of sensations and emotions. The rhythm of the Zohar offers many voices in which each sage continues and further develops the thought of the prior speaker. Hellner-Eshed compares the Zohar narrative to a jazz jam session, where a common melodic theme performed by the ensemble branches into solo improvisations that build to greater surprise, complexity and crescendo — the more virtuosity, the more wonderful and surprising the innovations. </p>
<p>One of her conclusions is, “The genius of the Zohar as a book lies precisely in its ability to capture the life of the experiences in Rabbi Shimon’s circle.” And thereby, according to Hellner-Eshed, it draws the reader into the mystical journey. She boldly claims that an academic attempt to understand the text should coincide properly with the attempt to induce a mystical experience. </p>
<p>What percentage of the Zohar fits Hellner-Eshed’s description? For that, we have to turn to the actual text of the Zohar. The Zohar corpus as published in the 16th century contains many reworked texts of ancient and medieval materials; there is certainly a large chunk of the Zohar that portrays the grand epic story of Shimon and his companions, but there are many segments that do not.</p>
<p>The fourth volume of the Pritzker edition of the Zohar (2007) was a diverse volume containing many texts that do not fit the model. It included a paraphrase of Philo of Alexandria’s ban on abortion, a Shiite style apocalypse of a messiah who is hidden in heaven, citations of 12th-century Ashkenazic theology, and selections from the rewritten biblical narrative of late antiquity.  </p>
<p>The newly published fifth volume of the Pritzker Zohar exemplifies Hellner-Eshed’s thesis in the delightful story of the Old Man of Mishpatim, who teaches though riddles and paradox and then explains them with a chivalrous story of a damsel in the castle who reveals herself only to the worthy kabbalist. But is also contains the terse and bombastic Book of Concealment, which describes the primordial world before emanation. Hellner-Eshed does not explain how the latter gnomic work fits with her selections. In addition, Hellner-Eshed’s biggest lack is that her work does not discuss the huge number of Zohar passages about mitzvahs, Halacha, rituals or pietistic life, all of which are admirably represented in Matt’s new volume.</p>
<p>Armed with these books, one can now begin to appreciate a cultural and religious treasure of Judaism. No journalist or book reviewer should write about Kabbalah again without first reading Hellner-Eshed. Her work steers the English reader between the Scylla of Kabbalah as technical sefirot and the Charybdis of Kabbalah as the personalized New Age spirituality. Hellner-Eshed’s work treats the Zohar as a mystical fantasy in which the Knights of the Round Table are rabbis living in an eroticized Middle Earth and spurred to great deeds by their love of the damsel Shechinah. Then, the beautifully edited Pritzker translation allows the interested reader to travel on these mystical journeys, yet still return home safely. </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2010/01/08/a-neo-weberian-theory-of-american-civil-religion/">Philip Gorski, Professor at Yale offers three attitudes at the immanent frame</a> toward the relationship of religion and state in America.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Liberal secularists</strong> believe that the religious and political spheres should be radically separated; <strong>religious nationalist</strong>s believe that they should be tightly integrated; and <strong>civil religionists</strong> believe that they should be overlapping but independent.<br />
The governing metaphor of <strong>religious nationalism</strong> in the United States is blood: blood as in blood sacrifice on the battlefield, and blood as in the blood purity of the nation. The deep roots of this tradition are to be found in the bloody wars and priestly sacrifices portrayed in the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p>The governing metaphor of <strong>liberal secularism </strong>is autonomy: autonomy as in individual choice and institutional separation. The deep roots of this tradition are to be found in the atomistic and anti-religious creed of the Epicureans. Faint echoes of it can be found in, say, the writings of Thomas Jefferson.. Its most complete—and virulent—expressions today are Randian libertarianism on the right and soft-Nietzschean post-modernism on the left.</p>
<p>The governing metaphor of <strong>civil religion,</strong> finally, is covenant: covenant as in collective commitment to a set of sacred principles and collective responsibility for their realization. The deep roots of this tradition are to be found in the Biblical covenants between the Ancient Israelites and their God. Its more immediate roots can be traced to the New England Puritans</p>
<p>For the <strong>religious nationalist</strong>, America is a “Christian nation” or, perhaps, a “Judeo-Christian nation.” In this vision, religious and political communities should be coterminous.</p>
<p>For the <strong>radical secularist,</strong> America is a liberal society comprised of autonomous individuals. In this vision, religious and political communities ought to be completely distinct.</p>
<p>For the <strong>civil religionist,</strong> finally, America is a moral community that seeks to balance solidarity and pluralism. In this vision, the religious and political communities inevitably overlap with one another.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Now how would this apply to the Orthodox community? They seem to use the religious nationalism model when dealing with Israeli society. But it seems that the majority of Centrist Orthodoxy follows liberal secularism in America. Why? They keep their religion and their Americanism bifurcated. Yet, there are selected groups and rabbis in the community that do accept civil religion. But which? On the other hand, some parts are beginning to identify with American religious nationalism and identify with Republican or Christian right values.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can we conceptualize the community not as right and left but based on which of these three models they follow? </strong>Or to keep things closer to the way people think now- which model does Open Orthodoxy follow? (The latter may be a much harder question than it looks.) Which does the yeshivah world follow?  How about a supporter of AIPAC? Which does Chabad follow? Which does Aish Hatorah follow taking into account their production of the movie “Obsession” on their view of terrorism? Or do the  various blogs follow? And in these distinctions, one’s age and generation does matter and will change the results. <strong>Among orthodoxy, who is a libertarian, who a covnant thinker of values, and who a nationalist? Does it change the conception of orthodoxy?</strong></p>
<p>The religion of the 1950’s was a Judeo-Christian covenant. At the end of the 1970’s Robert Bellah reoriented everyone and said civil religion was empty. “Writing amidst the collective funk of the mid-1970s, Bellah famously concluded that the American civil religion was an empty and broken shell” And it led many clergy to preach that one must turn to religion to reclaim society. Without religion one has the vacuous worship of the self. <strong>What does it mean when rabbis in 2009 are still saying that religion will save you from “Sheilaism”?</strong></p>
<p>When Rav Soloveitchik writes in Confrontation that “it is quite legitimate to speak of a Judeo-Christian tradition…However, when we shift the focus from the dimension of culture to that of faith… the whole idea of a tradition of faiths and the continuum of revealed doctrines…is utterly absurd…” In the 1950’s he seems to follow the civil religion model? But does Lonley Man of Faith agree? Which of the three is he associated with now?<br />
I was asked in the comments on an earlier post: How does all this evangelicalism relate to the thinking of thinkers like Taylor and Habermas. Gorski offer an answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>.Now, there are plenty of people… who would disagree that civil religion is a necessary means to this end. First, there are non-theistic neo-Kantian rationalists—such as Rawls, Habermas, and Audi—who would be somewhat uneasy about the religious dimension of civil religion. Then, there are theistic neo-Aristotelian confessionalists—such as MacIntyre, Yoder, and Hauerwas—who would be somewhat uneasy about the civil dimension of civil religion. But each critique supplies an answer to the other.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Among Orthodox, are they more worried about the civil or the religion in American civil religion?</strong></p>

				<p>In the 1960’s the Catholic Ghetto walls came down. In the 1950&#8217;s Catholics went to Catholic school, lived in Catholic enclaves, and had all their social needs met by the catholic community.  One only left for graduate school or when certain professions required one to have non-Catholic co-workers.  In the nineteen sixties, everything changed. Catholics wanted in live in new locations,  new suburbs and exurbs, the idea that one should only live around Catholics declines and the cultural revolution of the 1960’s called into question the provincialism and parochialism of these enclaves.  Some of these Catholic Ghettos dissolved entirely – from near total allegiance to the Church to minimal attendance, and even then only by the elderly.</p>
<p>Catholic teaching taught that building a parochial school is more important than a Church and that one would lose one’s faith in public school.  Jews at this point were in favor of public schools, and many of the orthodox saw day schools as entirely unneeded for girls and a hot bed of Zionism.</p>
<p>The question is: Can the Orthodox Jewish community learn anything from the Catholic example? Are there things to learn about rapid declines of enclaves? Are there any reasons it wont happen to places like Teaneck? Will the young gen y- millennials share their parents Modern Orthodox provincialism?  What about when they move to new cities, new professions or disdain living with the gen-x’ers? Dont just say we are committed to our religion in a way that Catholics are not.  Catholics were more committed and  had a much longer tradition of day schools.</p>
<p>Let’s turn to day schools. The Catholic system lost most of its attendees in the nineteen sixties. By the end of the decade they were down to 15%.  N ow 40 years later they find themselves as an unsustainable system strapped for cash and may have to close. What can Orthodox Jews learn from it? I am not sure but we should ask ourselves what we can learn.</p>
<p>The quotes below are from a variety of papers. Some are based on a 2007 Notre Dame Study and some from the Bergen county schools. One factor they cite is that without nuns they have to pay real salaries for teachers. Is anyone here old enough to remember when Jewish day school teachers were seriously underpaid? We cannot go back to hiring Holocaust survivors who don&#8217;t live in our communities or to being months behind on salary payments.</p>
<p>Also many Jews and Catholics went to parochial school to avoid the public school in immigrant neighborhoods. We don&#8217;t live in immigrant neighborhoods anymore and many public schools are of the same class and caste as the parochial schools. The article also points out that we expect more. We are not first generation college bound anymore. There are currently high expectations for a school. When parents were lacking in either general  or Jewish studies they expected less. Now what?</p>
<blockquote><p>Many parents of children in Catholic schools attended these schools themselves and look back nostalgically at a day when Catholic schools, just a step past “The Bells of St. Mary’s,” were staffed by nuns, brothers and priests. Today, however, they account for a mere 4% of the staff, many of them in administration.</p>
<p>The glory days of the U.S. Catholic parochial school are gone, according to a new University of Notre Dame report, and the church must rethink its mission in order to recapture the school system&#8217;s lost luster.<br />
The nuns and priests who educated generations of American Catholics are almost gone, retired or deceased.. Faculty salaries are too low while tuitions and costs are rising, the report says.</p>
<p>Catholic schools are in steep decline, their enrollment having “steadily dropped by more than half from its peak of five million 40 years ago.”Among the better-known reasons: 1) nuns and priests who once staffed teaching positions have retired and their ranks have not been renewed in the near-total absence of new American “vocations”; 2) as urban Catholics suburbanized over the past two generations, Church officials for various reasons did not choose to follow them out by establishing suburban schools in large numbers; 3) having fully entered the mainstream of American life, Catholics are less drawn than previously to separate institutions.</p>
<p>There was a time when parochial schools seemed almost omnipresent, when the daily migration of kids in plaid clothes seemed to fill every street. However, with enrollments plummeting and one school after another closing its doors, the torrent of Catholic school kids has become a trickle, and it looks like the days of Catholic education may well be numbered.</p>
<p>When it comes to Catholic education in America, the numbers are downright startling. In 1965, approximately half of all Catholic families sent their kids to parochial schools; today, roughly 15% do so. While there are numerous reasons for this, the big one seems to be that the cost of parochial school has vastly increased. Once upon a time, Catholic classes were largely taught by clerics. Today, however, fewer Catholics are choosing to enter the priesthood or the nunnery; in fact, one statistic states that there are presently more nuns over 90 than under 50 years old.</p>
<p>Another concern has been a reduction in religious definition. For many people, Catholicism has become less of an all-consuming lifestyle and more of a part-time identity. Where Catholic education was once a responsibility for Catholic parents, it is increasingly becoming an expensive luxury.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in areas where public education has improved, parochial education has suffered. For example, in Northern Virginia, where I grew up, Catholic schools once offered the best educational choices. However, as the area&#8217;s schools have improved, Catholic education has simply become a more expensive option.</p></blockquote>
<p>You might have not seen the former paragraphs which were from NYT and other papers. But what about those who live in Bergen county? Did you not see the Bergen record two months ago? Has anyone called any of the Catholic parochial schools to see if anything can be brainstormed together? This article is on the remaining 15% of Catholics still going to parochial school having to leave because of the 2009 recession. They closed 40 out of 137 schools in the last few years. In addition, the local public schools which uses licensed teachers are currently seen as offering a superior education.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bergen Record &#8211; Catholic schools enrollment drop blamed on economy<br />
Friday, November 13, 2009 BY TONY GICAS</p>
<p>CLIFTON — The economic downturn has created frightening unemployment rates, forced many Americans to foreclose on their homes, brought sticker shock into the nation&#8217;s grocery stores and has even changed the way people plan their children&#8217;s education.</p>
<p>More specifically, many New Jerseyans have either decided to take their children out of parochial schools or send them to public schools because of the financial commitment required at most Catholic schools.</p>
<p>According to Brian Gray, a spokesman for the National Catholic Education Association, enrollment at America&#8217;s Catholic schools reached its peak in the 1960s with about 5.2 million students. By 1980 that number had dropped to approximately 3.1 million and last year the nationwide enrollment hit 2.19 million.</p>
<p>In September 2000, the Newark Archdiocese had 137 grade schools in Union, Essex, Hudson and Bergen counties. Now, it has just 97. The school population in neighboring Paterson jumped by 1,000 students this year, a 3.5 percent increase in the district that has about 28,000 students, the district reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think down the line if the economy continues this way the tuition at parochial schools will remain unaffordable to many and the numbers will continue to decline,&#8221; Tardalo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore they may desire a private education for their children, but if they have to they&#8217;ll opt to send their children to a public school.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said parochial schools offered &#8220;an equivalent educational experience&#8221; during his time as a Catholic school principal, however he did stipulate their teachers do not face the same licensing requirements as public school teachers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I exclude from my discussion the wealthy Jewish prep schools like Ramaz becuase they are based on having a financial endowment  and have a different constituency. The question remains- Will the average Jewish days schools decline the way the Catholic schools did? Why not? Why do we think we have a more sustainable system than the Catholic schools? Even if everyone struggles to keep their kids in their current day school, will those 10  years younger than you want to enter this rat race? Will your kids want to continue this struggle? Anyone have good data about those moving to the new Sun Belt suburbs? I have no solutions, only historical questions.</p>
<p>This post came from running into a neighbor HF in the grocery for whom this is a major concern. It is a write-up of a discussion that occurred by meat aisle. I do want to write this up as an op-ed at some point.</p>

				<p>Interesting book review on questions of authorship as applied to Dante.  The critical theorists have already shown that medievals treated Aristotelian philosophy the way we treat the rules of physics, not something that needs an author. And they showed how some medieval texts were written with the reader in mind- either as images on the side of the page or only giving allusions and letting the reader apply them on his own. Medievals also wrote as a form of revelation, and treated cosmologies as revelatory and they considered the bearers of the scholarly tradition as possessing an immanent truth. Not everyone who wrote was considered an <em>auctores</em>.</p>
<p>This opens up the question of what rabbinic Jewish author were doing? The Geonim and Nahmanides were writing with the a Divine spirit, or at least legal decisions were guided by the Divine. Some Kabbalistic works are seen as transmitting ancient knowledge or ascribed to older figures. And the Guide for the Perplexed is just that, a guide for the reader. But what were the “authors” of Pirkei deRebbe Eliezer  thinking? </p>
<p>To consider the modern issues: Judaism never bought into the idea of the individual author and still has trouble with intellectual property of an author. In many texts, Torah is seen as possessed by the collective or as eternally given. So when a posek writes a teshuvah: Is it his own authorship? Does he write as bearer of a mesorah, like a medieval kabbalist? Is there a revelation granted to the community? We tend to frame these questions using the anachronistic modern contrast of autonomy and authority. We need to ask: what is involved in an act of religious writing? Does one write ex cathedra, with immanent truth, with revelation, or for the reader?</p>
<p>But then it becomes more difficult- what happens when the written opinions of a rabbi are involved in petty squabbles or personal interests or manipulated by politics? Ascoli’s book on Dante  asks that question directly – If Dante claimed to write with revelation then how can he till be involved in his petty squabbles?  What happens when someone writes with immanent divine truth and also acts as an independent agent? </p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=25533">Albert Russell Ascoli.  Dante and the Making of a Modern Author. Cambridge  Cambridge University Press, 2008. Reviewed by Jan G. Soffner (Zentrum Cr Literatur- und Kulturforschung) Published on H-Italy </a>(December, 2009)<br />
<strong><br />
By Which Authority Did Dante Write?</strong></p>
<p>If one happens to talk by chance about Dante&#8217;s fourteenth-century masterpiece _Divine Comedy_, one can observe a strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>Dante seems to misuse God for his political opinions, by letting the divine justice condemn his enemies, and for his personal<br />
pride or arrogance, by having all the best dead poets honor him (see, for instance, Inferno IV, 100-102). Moreover, isn&#8217;t it already quite<br />
presumptuous to &#8220;know&#8221; the divine verdict about everybody who has ever died? All this seems to be even stranger, since this work is<br />
evidently a literary text, not an inspired prophecy like the Revelation. So how could Dante attribute this authority to himself?<br />
And did he attribute this authority to himself after all, or did he &#8220;just&#8221; write fiction?</p>
<p>This suspicion arose as soon as the _poema sacro&#8211;_the &#8220;holy poem,&#8221; as Dante himself calls it (Paradiso XXV, 1)&#8211;was written. Nearly<br />
seven hundred years of &#8220;Dantology&#8221; (to use Robert Harrison&#8217;s brilliantly provocative term)[1] have not convincingly resolved this<br />
doubt. In the fourteenth century cosmological representations in the _Cosmographia_ of BernardusSilvestris (ca. 1084-1178), the _Anticlaudianus_ of Alanus ab Insulis (1120-1202) and the _Tesoretto_ of Brunetto Latini (ca. 1220-94). They read the text either as a spiritual revelation and a dream, despite its literary construction and despite the claim to report a physical journey, or they interpreted it in a &#8220;modern&#8221; way, that is, as a fictional construction, despite the explicit claims of the _Commedia_to be a revelatory work.</p>
<p>Ascoli also has an excellent knowledge notonly of the works of modern theoretical thinkers such as Hannah<br />
Arendt, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Mary Carruthers about literary authorship and authority, but also of the discursive<br />
figurations of _auctores_ available at Dante&#8217;s time. Ascoli starts with an extensive analysis of contemporary concepts of<br />
authorship, and of the manner in which Dante seems to be relating to them as a whole. Ascoli argues that the image of an author stemmed<br />
from the trustworthy _auctoritates_ of the ancient and/or philosophical and theological tradition granting for an immanent<br />
truth to biblical scribes and the true author, who is God. These traditional concepts refer to _auctoritas_ as both an individual and<br />
impersonal power and knowledge. The _auctor_ thereby was not so much a creative agent, but rather a mediating power of knowledge. He was<br />
one worthy of faith and obedience.</p>
<p>Hence Dante, modeled as an individual traveler in the _Divine Comedy_, &#8220;comes, paradoxically, to embody the canons of<br />
impersonal authority&#8221; (p. 20). On the one hand Dante is thereby traditionalist and conservative, on the other, he is also provided<br />
with the &#8220;transgressive desire to appropriate that attribute for himself, for the vernacular, and for &#8216;modernity'&#8221; (p. 20f).</p>
<p>How can a fictional work gain a revelatory truth? Ascoli shows convincingly how Dante assumes the traditional role of an<br />
authoritative author without thereby relating to the pre-existing models of knowledge implied by these kinds of authorship.<br />
The unease of us moderns when confronted with Dante cannot just be about the relation to an ineffable divine Being. Representationalist<br />
modern authors work with a more or less Aristotelian concept of fiction, that is, with a concept of a poetic truth relying on<br />
modeling possibilities and an emotionality that can be addressed playfully and without consequences. However, Dante tells us a<br />
different story </p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a sample of chapter one of <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511380464&amp;ss=exc">Albert Russell Ascoli.  Dante and the Making of a Modern Author.</a><br />
Can we move beyond the dichotomies of authority/autonomy or submission/freedom and explain the act of religious writing or studying Torah or acting as a rabbi in terms of how they define authorship or role of the self in the process? </p>

				<p>I have a neighbor who is a physician who switched twenty five years ago from his Conservative upbringing to Orthodoxy because the latter offered a Yuppie lifestyle (bye bye Maneschewitz and chopped liver, hello Cheers Italian restaurant) and rational medical ethics (bye bye appeals to tradition).<br />
So, what now?<br />
Food has changed for many Americans, as Anthony Bourdain wrote in the NYT last week &#8220;Foodie Nation&#8221; (December 27, 2009)</p>
<blockquote><p>Something important happened to my former profession in 2007. I’m still unsure what, exactly — but there was a shift, the world of food tilting on its axis. Dining rooms were busy with ever more food-obsessed, better-informed customers&#8230;Chefs were now trusted enough to persuade customers to try what they themselves loved to eat. Hence the hooves and snouts and oily little fishes that increasingly popped up on menus
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodie">Wikipedia</a> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . foodies are amateurs who simply love food for consumption, study, preparation, and news . . . foodies want to learn everything about food, both the best and the ordinary, and about the science, industry, and personalities surrounding food.</p></blockquote>
<p>So my question is: How will this play itself out in religious groupings? Not everything is theology or law, people like to live their lives with those of similar lifestyles. How will those who go to Fairway to prepare for Shabbat only when they cannot get to a farmers market play itself out? How will those who prefer cerviche to gefilte fish create demarcations? or artisan bread in place of sugary egg challah? (once upon a time &#8211; the move from Orthodoxy to Conservative included a switch from herring to lox.)<br />
From the other direction- will those who crave the heimish cholent or the frat house buffalo wings create community distinctions? Parts of Orthodoxy have actually been going with this trend as the restaurant Solo has hired 2 of the Top Chefs as consultants and there will be a molecular gastronomy restaurant similar to the non-kosher WD-50 opening in Jerusalem.<br />
These shifts are never single cause and involve broader lifestyle changes. If the person that I mentioned at the start found doctors becoming Orthodox (there was still unwritten quotas and restricted positions for Jews entering medicine before). Yesterday&#8217;s NYT said that some of the in new fields will be narrative medicine, high tech security, and  sustainable energy-solar energy. Whichever group gets there first with the &#8220;torah of the imperative of solar energy&#8221; or &#8220;halakhot of security&#8221; wins them as congregants. This is not so far off since on linkedin &#8211; among the friends of my Israeli friends- the largest number work for NICE systems- which develops high tech security. Have you heard any shiur geared to that industry lately?<br />
So which rabbi or community will the solar energy engineer who feels there is a vital need to make our homes and synagogues energy efficient and reduce our global footprint pick? What if the engineer is also a foodie?<br />

				<p>Someone in the comments mentioned that my post was similar to a NYT op-ed and said it must be a meme going around. It is not a meme but that we all subscribe to the same list serves of religion information such as the Pew foundation that study and conduct surveys of religion in America. Orthodoxy, except for the truly sectarian, follows these trends as much as any other group does. So if you want to know the range of positions available at a given time they provide the guidelines. Orthodoxy will follow other similar conservative groups. Chief Rabbi Sacks is closer to Pope Benedict. NY Centrist Orthodoxy is closer to certain aspect of the Evangelicals and the Kiruv organizations are closest to other aspects of the Evangelicals.<br />
At the end of last month,<a href="http://pewforum.org/events/rss.php?EventID=221"> Pew held an interview with Rick Warren</a> to let journalists know where things are going.  Rick&#8217;s book, The Purpose Driven Life, is the best-selling nonfiction book in American history &#8211; over 30 million copies. That was the first quarter century of his career and corresponds to the religious turn in America. He has now turned to broader concerns. These are some of the directions and causes people will want from their Orthodoxy. Whoever gets there first will claim them</p>
<blockquote><p>We do training of what we call the three legs of the stool: business leadership, church leadership and public leadership in government.<br />
We have over 4,500 small groups. They meet in every city in Southern California.<br />
The second signature issue of our church we started in 1993, 10 years later, and it is called Celebrate Recovery. Celebrate Recovery is a Bible-based recovery program. It&#8217;s similar to AA but it&#8217;s built on the actual words of Jesus.<br />
The third signature issue we began in 2002, and that is our AIDS initiative for people infected and affected with AIDS.<br />
The fourth signature issue we began in 2003. It&#8217;s called the P.E.A.C.E. Plan. It&#8217;s a global humanitarian effort to take on the five biggest problems on the planet: poverty, disease, illiteracy, corruption and conflict. P.E.A.C.E. stands for Promote reconciliation, Equip ethical leaders, &#8220;A&#8221; is assist the poor, &#8220;C&#8221; is care for the sick and &#8220;E&#8221; is educate the next generation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice his working together with lay leadership and government agencies. He divides his Church into many focus groups “parents with a Downs child” “parents of an ADD child” “parents of twins.”<br />
His work with AA was done in Judaism by Rabbi Abraham Twerski and several elements of the Engaged Yeshivish world, not YU. Centrist Orthodoxy does not relish the thought of working with addictions as part of the rabbinate. Aids treatment is not part of the community at all.  Finally, the community does not make as its mission to fight poverty, disease, illiteracy, corruption, and conflict. This last one is where the future of American conservative religion lies.</p>
<blockquote><p>WARREN: the future of the world is not secularism. The future of the world is religious pluralism, and we must learn to get along. It is not secularism. There was the myth in the 20th century that if we just educate people they won&#8217;t need God anymore.<br />
I was the keynote speaker for ISNA, the Islamic Society of North America, which is the largest convention of Muslims. It was here in D.C. on the Fourth of July. There were 25,000 Muslims here in town, and they invited a non-Muslim to be the keynote speaker.</p></blockquote>
<p>This affirmation of religious pluralism from an exclusivist Evangelical Christian is where things are going. And unlike the 1980’s and 1990’s where Evangelicals said “woe is me- the secularists are after us;” Rick Warren is now boldly going out into the world and trying to put relgion in the public sphere (Don&#8217;t confuse his position with that of First Things and David Novak.) Many college students participate in interfaith events as part of the post 9//11 world, even Orthodox. We have had orthodox Jews and Muslims discussing difficulties in dietary laws and hair covering, Catholics and Orthodox Jews holding joint Friday night dinners, and groups of several faiths meeting to each talk about their experiences- not theology or doctrine but personal narratives.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have many, many who are gay leaders across the nation who have worked with me on AIDS. Kay and I have personally given millions of dollars &#8211; millions of dollars personally &#8211; to help people with HIV and AIDS. We&#8217;ve worked with all kinds of gay groups on these issues. I wrote those guys apologies and said, you guys know I didn&#8217;t mean this. Oh, we knew. We knew it, Rick.<br />
But all of the criticism came from people who didn&#8217;t know me &#8211; 100 percent. Not a single gay leader who knew me personally criticized me. Not one. All of it came from people who didn&#8217;t know me personally because I didn&#8217;t have the relationship. That goes back to this thing about if you don&#8217;t have the relationship, where do you know where that guy&#8217;s head is anyway? He said that. He didn&#8217;t correct it. Well, that&#8217;s not their fault; that&#8217;s my fault.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>My message is to the individual, and that is, every individual matters. I don&#8217;t care who you are or what you&#8217;ve done, what you claim to be or &#8211; you matter to God and you are loved unconditionally. You can&#8217;t make God stop loving you. Here&#8217;s my philosophy of life: If God gives me a choice to reject him or love him &#8211; because it&#8217;s not love if I&#8217;m forced to love him &#8211; if God gives me a choice to reject him or love him, then I&#8217;ve got to give everybody else that choice too. And that&#8217;s why I believe in America. I&#8217;ve got to give everybody the choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is his philosophy on GLBT issues as an evangelical. He does not support Gay marriage but would not support the anti-legislation either. The press and the blogs love to tear him apart from both sides. The web is filled with statements hinging on his every word to see what he accepts or rejects. In contrast,  Rev. Richard Cizik  who was Vice President for the National Association of Evangelicals and was  leading evangelicals toward ecology and global stewardship  (another role model for orthodoxy) expressed his support for same sex unions and that he was closer to supporting same sex marriage and was forced to resign from his leadership position.</p>
<blockquote><p>Melinda Gates, who was a friend of mine said, Rick, I get it. The church could be the distribution center for health care. I said, not only health care, for everything else. You can use it for education, you can use it &#8211; all five things that we&#8217;re talking about in the P.E.A.C.E. program. I said, let me give you an example.Then we started teaching them more things like how to dress a wound, all the way up to how to administer ARVs. Today, right now, I have 1,400 trained community health care workers &#8211; it will be over 1,500 by the end of December &#8211; in an area that had one doctor a year-and-a-half ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice he is friends with confirmed agnostic Melinda and Bill Gates. And when he asks for money it is not to build churches or parochial institutions but to offer health care in Africa.  Young Jews like AJWS and Hazon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Third is I added up all that the church had paid me in 25 years and I gave it all back. I knew I was being put under the spotlight, and I never wanted anybody to think that I do what I do for money. I don&#8217;t. I do it because I love Jesus Christ. And I love people.<br />
We&#8217;re not going to change our lifestyle one bit. I still live in the same house I&#8217;ve lived in for 17 years. I drive a 10-year-old Ford truck. I bought my watch at Wal-Mart. I don&#8217;t own a boat, I don&#8217;t own a plane, I don&#8217;t own a vacation home. I didn&#8217;t want to be a televangelist. The second thing is seven years ago I stopped taking a salary from Saddleback Church, so I effectively retired.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>See any Orthodox leaders going this route?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We lowered the age of the leadership body in our church by 16 years in one week. We had a group of pastors who have been with me pretty much since the start that we call our elders. Most of us are in our 50s, mid-50s, and we have led the church all these years. All along we&#8217;ve been mentoring the next generation, which is what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m spending the rest of my life mentoring the next generation. We had a group of young guys who were in their 30s and a couple reaching 40, and in one week we turned over the leadership.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is important for the change in leadership style<a href="http:///kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/determine-your-rabbinical-age/">&#8211; see this quiz that I posted a while ago</a>.<strong>Take the Quiz</strong></p>
