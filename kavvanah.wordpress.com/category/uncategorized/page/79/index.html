				<p>Here is a notice from an upcoming conference at Fordham. The topic speaks for itself and the Jewish community would have much to learn by analyzing the similarities and differences.   Any thoughts on the loss of the Twenty-Something in Judaism from this program?</p>
<p>The first major difference in the way they run a conference that I notice is that Fordham is bringing in to speak the best experts in each field, the ones that wrote the definitive books. Centrist Orthodoxy only brings in people within that community who are at least temporarily approved. So they have the experts in popular culture, Centrism only brings in those who have read the books of the experts. </p>
<p>Another difference is the role of the empirical data. Centrism at best will bring in someone who did a minor study without controls and non random sample. At Fordham, the bad news empirical data is placed front and center. There is an issue to talk about.  They actually mention that religious kids are hooking up. </p>
<p>Finally, a more subtle difference is that Centrism uses a model of deviance, similar to Dobson. If there is a problem in a child, then it was the fault of the parents or the educators. Centrist social psychology stacks the deck in favor of the perfection institution, it was just a deviance in the implementation. Here the model is social trends and autonomous choice. (I may fiske the recent Azrieli survey on parenting as an example).</p>
<p>But then I realized that this is not fair. They Catholic seminaries are not taking in this data or having this discussion. Rather, it is University in the hands of the University Professor laity that is having this discussion. I suppose if the seminaries wanted to know something they would also invite an acceptable clergy who was in the audience and not one of the actual speakers.</p>
<p>When evangelicals make these lists of why 20 somethings are not affiliated, they also include provincialism and lack of culture. These are not current Catholic problems, but they are Centrist problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>Twenty-somethings raised as Catholics are swelling the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated.  Even those who continue to identify as Catholic are regularly absent from the pews and are likely to judge faith less important in their lives than did their parents and grandparents. Yet many twenty-somethings hold traditional beliefs about God, prayer, and life after death; many express spiritual yearnings and the desire to serve. </p>
<p>This two-day conference will examine the lives of young adults and their relationship to the Catholic Church—or the lack thereof.  From sexuality to spirituality to service, the conference will present the data, and explore the issues, obstacles and opportunities that mark the fraught relationship between twenty-somethings and the church in today’s cultural, economic, and religious contexts. </p>
<p>The speakers include leading experts and practitioners: James Davidson, Robert Putnam, Melissa Cidade, David Campbell, Carmen Cervantes,  Donna Freitas, Colleen Carroll Campbell, Tom Beaudoin, Rachel Bundang, Bill McGarvey, Marilyn Santos, Tami Schmitz, James Martin, Robert Beloin; and twenty-somethings themselves</p>

				<p>I know I am behind on posting about some of the new works on Kabbalah. In the meantime here is a nice video interview with Ronit Meroz about her forthcoming book about the various strata in the Zohar. She states that the texts of the Zohar were written between the 11th and the 14th century, layer upon layer, each generation adding or taking out what they wanted. she claims that the manuscripts show that there were many things called Zohar.<br />
Meroz places the first texts in Israel in the 11th century, those texts were reworkings of Rabbinic ideas taken a little further. The early drafts were not mystical yet, rather more mythic versions of Rabbinic statements. Here is an 18 page taste of her book <a href="http://sephardic.fiu.edu/journal/RonitMeroz.pdf">from an earlier article.</a> (Whatever similarities her view has to Emden and Sde Hemed would need to wait until the full book comes out.)<br />
 For the alternate view, <a href="http:///kavvanah.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/was-the-zohar-ever-a-book/">see my post on Daniel Abrams,</a> who claims the Zohar was never a book until created by the printers.</p>
<p>Notice how she changes the question when the interviewer asks: Is it worth it [to spend a decade looking at 1000 manuscripts]? Is it interesting to do this?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Here is statement from Rav Aviner issued on Friday. Can we use this to test EJ&#8217;s desire to use Rawls? How would you solve this statement of Rav Aviner?</p>
<p>I am not interested in the halakhic or politics aspects. I want a continuation of the discussion on the use of Rawls. Hartman preached pluralism of as the solution, Menachem Kellner makes an ahistoric typology between rational Maimonideans and irrational racist Halevi followers. Rav Aviner  defines democracy as the will of the people and the fulfillment of ideals in a Platonic state way. He does not know that here we define democracy as civil liberties, civil right, representation democracy or minority rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rav  Aviner on…<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Without  Loyalty  There is No Citizenship</span><span style="font-size:small;"> </span><br />
[Be-Ahavah   U-Be-Emunah – Shemot 5771 – translated by R.  Blumberg]</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">Question: A law has been proposed in  the Knesset that any non-Jew who  wishes to receive citizenship in our country must swear a loyalty oath:  &#8220;I  declare that I will be a faithful citizen to the Jewish state, and I  undertake  to respect the country&#8217;s laws.&#8221; Is this law  appropriate?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">Answer: Obviously, I don&#8217;t deal with  laws and jurisprudence, but with the  Torah. And so, here is how things look according to the  Torah:</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">1. It is halachically possible for a  non-Jew to live in the Land of  Israel. The Torah allows for a ger toshav, or resident alien. The Poskim   [halachic decisors] write that even in our times there is room for a  status  similar to that of the resident alien (see Rambam, Ra’avad, Kessef  Mishneh). In  other words, it is possible for a non-Jew to live in the L and.  Yet  there are two preconditions to this,  one moral and the other political.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">2. The first condition is moral:  undertaking the seven laws commanded to  Noach, the foundations of human morality, by virtue of which man is  called man.  True, some take the lenient view that it suffices for a non-Jew to  undertake not  to worship idols, and such was the ruling of Maran Ha-Rav Avraham  Yitzchak  Ha-Kohain Kook (Mishpat Kohain), and our Rabbi Ha-Rav Tzvi Yehuda Kook  (Sichot  HaRav Tzvi Yehuda – Eretz Yisrael). After all, this is the Land given to   Avraham, who fought against idolatry. Hence it cannot be that  somebody who goes against this should live here.  Therefore, this is not the place  of the various types of Christians, and of various pagan faiths from the  Far  East. By contrast, Islam is not idolatry.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">3. The political precondition is that  the candidate must accept the  state&#8217;s authority (Rambam, Hilchot Melachim). This is something obvious  and  logical that exists throughout all the nations of the world. Certainly,  somebody  busy destroying our country and killing us cannot live here. That goes  without  saying.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">4. Let&#8217;s just point out that there is  no racism in either of these  conditions. Racism is a biological doctrine that distinguishes between  races,  but within the Jewish people there are Jews from almost all of the  races,  whether they were born Jews or converted.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:small;">5. All that said, the idea of a  Jewish-Democratic state can find  expression, but note that I place the word Jewish first. In other words,  there  is room for democracy on condition that it does not contradict Judaism.  That is  certainly how things must be. After all, this is the State of Israel,  or, in the  words of Theodore Herzl, &#8220;the state of the Jews&#8221;, in both Hebrew and  German, or,  &#8220;the Jewish state&#8221;, in Yiddish and French. This is a Jewish state, and  not a  state of all its citizens.</span></em></p>
<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:small;">Certainly, democracy, i.e., the will of  the majority, cannot force an  immoral or antinational law. Examples would include a law that would  force  Shabbat violations or a law that would decide to erase the State of  Israel and  make it part of the United States. Even the philosopher Plato described  an  idealistic democracy aimed at the general good as an organism and not  just a  utilitarian gathering of individuals. Certainly there are timeless  ideals that  transcend the law. After all, a nation is not built solely on economics  and  security, but on ideals and history as well.</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:small;">To cut a nation off from its history,  from its soul, is an immoral act,  and the most antidemocratic act there could be.</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:small;">Let us support real, exalted democracy:  responsibility and loyalty to the  Nation down through the generations</span></strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>I repeat I am not interested <strong>in politics or the halakhic status of Christianity.</strong>  I want a Rawlsian discussion. Or do we need the basics of Locke? Should we be pushing Rav Hayyim Hirschenson as one who saw the need for democracy? Is this just a problem of Israel not having a constitution? Would Habermas or Charles Taylor work better in Israel were we allow the voice of non-democratic positions a say in the public discourse. We are speaking to a group that does not realize that Plato is seen as the opposite of the democratic society.<br />
From a politic perspective see Jeffrey Goldberg article from this morning <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/12/what-if-israel-ceases-to-be-a-democracy/68582/">&#8220;What If Israel Ceases to Be a Democracy?&#8221;</a>. Can we create a Judaism with some of Locke, Rawls, or any other democratic thinker? </p>

				<p>Some further reflections on popular culture. Those of my readers who are working on the same project, if you use this blog, then cite it. </p>
<p>This continues the six prior posts (1) <a href="../../../../2010/12/26/cruise-ship-synagogues-for-orthodoxy/index.html">Cruise Ship Synagogues</a>, (2) <a href="../../../../2010/02/18/suburban-religion/index.html">Suburban Religion,</a>  (3) <a href="../../../../2010/10/30/christian-rock-and-kiruv/index.html">Christian Rock and Kiruv</a> (4) <a href="../../../../2010/12/01/popular-culture-and-judaism-1/index.html">Popular Culture and Judaism</a> (5) <a href="kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/the-disney-ization-of-faith/index.html">Disney-ization of Faith</a> (6) <a href="../../../../2010/05/27/the-divine-commodity-skye-jethani/index.html">The Divine Commodity</a></p>
<p><strong>Today we will look at the book Religion and Popular Culture : Rescripting the Sacred by Richard W Santana and Gregory Erickson 2008. </strong> The major claim of the book is that we understand religion through its contemporary pop culture and laity driven versions. A Feldheim book or a blog or an experience from Israel determines what a text means.</p>
<p>The United States is the world&#8217;s primary creator and exporter of popular mass culture and arguably one of the most religious countries in modern history. As a result, the coexistence of American religion with popular culture has created a fertile yet caustic environment for new religious belief structures, new texts, and new worldviews that are uniquely American. This work considers ways in which American television, advertising, music, and video games have played a significant role in creating, representing, and influencing contradictory religious identities. The authors examine three distinct segments of popular culture that &#8220;rescript the sacred.”</p>
<p>What they mean is that people understand their religion though the popular culture interpretation. TV, movies, novels and blogs now serve as the official narrated version for the religion means. They serves as a new scripture. </p>
<p>This creates a huge gap between the official interpretation and the popular interpretation. Popular religion gives its order and meaning and shows the tension between the religion of the ordinary person and the theologians priests and other religious professionals. There are learned presentations of the doctrines and practices, yet for many believers the most important parts of religion are those offering emotional security and personal relationship. American religion is bi-directional between popular and established religion.  Lay people interpret the faith in its unique ways and influence the clergy.</p>
<p>M Lawrence Moore has suggested that our post-secular era is an era of the commoditization of religion. (see Oliver Roy in prior post)</p>
<p>According to the authors, America as a religious or Biblical culture that does not actually read the bible- they understand it through the Da Vinci code, Purpose Driven Life, Left Behind, Joel Osteen, TV, and famous preachers. Even when people go to ear famous preachers they actually spend most of their time with the side shows like the children’s show where Biblical figure as superheros defeat evil villains of secular culture with priestly magical garments. The Bible becomes objects and forces of power mightier than a sword. There is action and heroic virtue but not textual significance. They don’t get their power from reading the Bible but from its power. If you have faith or commitment then you vanquish your spiritual enemies.</p>
<p>The authors stress that popular religion is the religion of the laypeople By definition, they treat popular religion as having an extra institutional status, non-elite practitioners, immediacy and informality. It draws on behaviors both participant and observer recognize as religious even if not condoned by the religious elite. (p. 18) Focus on what people do and not what they think- blurring of sacred and profane- it surrounds us in everyday life.</p>
<p>The lines in America between religion and popular culture blur in ways “that leave scholars dizzy.” Paradoxes resolve themselves in ways that are not ordinarily obvious. (Think of the person who works in a corporate cubicle and defines work as cognitive, so religion is his emotional redemption. So hearing a rock star in shul is emotional and therefore Rav Nachman and Roger Daltry both say the same religious message to oppose his workplace rationalism.)</p>
<p>You cannot say they don’t understand the text correctly, famous case of experts saying that Waco Branch Davidians did not understand the Book of Revelations. You cannot tell pop culture Orthodox that they misunderstand the halakhic world. They have already reached a point where there were rabbis and authority figures who supported their opinion.</p>
<p>They think Biblical history is the most important event in world history but they interpret it through pop culture. Modern version of story is more real than the original.</p>
<p>Popular culture rescues religion from the bonds of the institutions that one grew up with. The bonds of the pulpit rabbi and HS rebbe and places it in the free floating experience of the year in Israel as one’s emotional retreat.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on applying this to Orthodoxy?</p>

				<p>I did not post the Ngram, but in my playing with it I discovered that Maimonides went through a cultural peak in the 1990’s, the way Buber did in the 1960’s. Maimonides’ <em>Guide</em> has entered the canon on many college campuses as part of the general education requirement<br />
.<br />
To serve these new readers, there is a new book by Jonathan Jacobs of Colgate University, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reason-Morality-Medieval-Jewish-Philosophy/dp/019954283X">Law, Reason, and Morality, in Medieval Jewish Philosophy</a>. The book places Saadyah Bahye, and Maimonides into the context of Aristotelian tradition as part of an undergraduate philosophy curriculum. The book has not come into the library yet,  but the author just published a nice article on the role of tradition in medieval Jewish thought.</p>
<p>Kant declared that rationality meant autonomous reason, if something was know by means of tradition then it is not rationality. Gadaemer returned the respectability of tradition. Here is an article discussing tradition in Saadyah Bahye, and Maimonides. What makes the article interesting is that it does not get involved in history or ideology. Jacobs does not concern himself with Islamic theories of reliable traditions nor with connecting Maimonides to any modern movement.</p>
<p>According to Jacobs, there can be good reason to follow tradition even if we don’t personally know the reason. Moderns care about choice, volition, and decision. Since the Torah is rational and there are reasons for the commandments and Torah is know by reason, we can follow the tradition .trusting that we will see the  rationality.</p>
<p>For the medieval, rationality develops over time. All three monotheistic regions share the belief in reason and we all accept tradition. Not Talmudic, Patristic, or Hadith interpretations but tradition that the Biblical faith with its doctrines and observances makes sense. Each particular tradition teaches a universal truth and we can only learn universal truths by means of being in a tradition.</p>
<p>It would be worthwhile to compare this presentation of Maimonides to the Haredi and Centrist uses of Maimonides. For Maimonides, tradition is not an end in itself or about authority or to use tradition to exclude positions. Tradition is individually a moment of one’s education and in community the bearer of universal values. Because of the need to grow in rationality, we temporarily accept tradtion, like medicine.</p>
<p><em>THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF MORAL TRADITION: A DEFENSE OF A MAIMONIDEAN THESIS<br />
Jonathan Jacobs. The Review of Metaphysics. Washington: Sep 2010. Vol. 64:1; pg. 55, 20 pgs</p>
<p>Maimonides (and other medieval Jewish thinkers) regarded tradition as an ethical and intellectual resource keeping us directed rightly, and also substantively perfecting us. Tradition sustains continuity with the past and connection with roots, and it is a guide into the future. Tradition sustains faithfulness to normatively authoritative origins and also supplies guidance for how to carry on leading well-led lives. </p>
<p>Jewish philosophers&#8217; repeated reference to Deuteronomy 4:6 and what it says about the importance of understanding the commandments &#8211; &#8220;observe them and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples&#8221; &#8211; is indicative of the importance of the exercise of reason in fulfilling the commandments. Bahya ibn Pakuda wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>if you are a man of sound mind and understanding, which qualify you to verify the traditions passed down to you from the prophets concerning the roots of religion and the origins of the acts of worship &#8211; then you are obliged to use your faculties in order to verify things both logically and by tradition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Saadia held a similar view and he argued extensively that the rationality of Judaism could be shown. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, in support of the validity of these laws, His messengers executed certain signs and wondrous miracles, with the result that we observed and carried out these laws immediately. Afterwards we discovered the rational basis for the necessity of their prescription so that we might not be left to roam at large without guidance.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Introductory Treatise to The Book of Beliefs and Opinions is largely devoted to just that issue and he shows how, with regard to one major concern after another, Judaism can be interpreted in terms of rational considerations. </p>
<p>The strong rationalistic current in medieval Jewish philosophy is distinguished from other forms of rationalism by the way in which it acknowledges that our rational comprehension needs to develop over time, through practices required by tradition.<br />
<strong>This bears some likeness to the Aristotelian notion that good habits and dispositions are necessary for attaining sound ethical understanding. The Jewish view differs in regard to the relations between understanding the world on the one hand, and excellent practice on the other. It also differs insofar as the Jewish view has a genuinely historical dimension. The enlargement of understanding is a process occurring in the history of a people and not just in an individual&#8217;s maturation and reflective sophistication. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We can now begin to see important differences between the Jewish understanding of tradition and its role, and Aristotle&#8217;s understanding of habit, understood as sustained, regular practice, transmitted across generations, and its role. Aristotle&#8217;s ethical thought takes habit to be of the first importance, but habit &#8211; while it is strongly relevant to tradition &#8211; is not the same as it. Tradition is often transmitted by habituation, but tradition is much more than a means of transmission. It can also be the substance of what is transmitted.</strong></p>
<p>In the early portions of The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, in discussing epistemological matters, Saadia noted that the authenticity of religion is attested by the senses and &#8220;acceptance is also incumbent upon anybody to whom it has been transmitted because of the attestation of authentic tradition.&#8221;29</p>
<blockquote><p>As for ourselves, <strong>the community of monotheists,</strong> we hold these three sources of knowledge to be genuine. To them, however, we may add a fourth source, which we have derived by means of the [other] three, and which has thus become for us a fiirther principle. That is [to say, we believe in] the validity of authentic tradition, by reason of the fact that it is based upon the knowledge of the senses as well as that of reason.30</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no conflict between the givenness or the certainty of revelation and the extensive role of human beings in elaborating and applying what is revealed. The Law speaks through not only the extensive reasoning and argumentation of the rabbis who originated the tradition but also through one&#8217;s own reasoning and understanding. In studying Torah one learns strategies of inquiry and argument, not just a fixed code. Moreover, such study includes multiple perspectives, contested interpretations, and enduringly hard cases. The wisdom that would be deployed by someone faithful to the Law would involve knowledge attained in experience and it would involve the cultivation of discerning perception, attention to ethically relevant features of persons, acts, and situations, knowledge of the Law in its complex multi-dimensionality, and knowledge of the ways in which its elements fit together. </p>
<p>There are at least two important observations to make about this. One is that the particularism of a tradition need not be at odds with the objectivity or universality of values it inculcates. The concrete details and specific requirements and practices of a tradition can be the way in which people learn universal values and become habituated to acting on them. A corollary to this is the important moral-psychological fact that the acquisition of values tends to occur in and through experience and contexts thickly textured with certain perspectives, practices, aspirations, and so forth.<br />

				<p>A half-year ago, I <a href="../../../../2010/05/27/the-divine-commodity-skye-jethani/index.html">posted about suburban religion</a> and its turning of the house of worship into a cruise ship. Well now the OU has officially designed a entertaining Orthodoxy with all social events on board. </p>
<blockquote><p>It has turned the church from an “ocean-liner” designed to move people from point A to point B (connecting people with God), to a “cruise ship” that is, in itself, the destination. One need never disembark because it contains everything</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a continuation of <a href="../../../../2010/12/06/the-disney-ization-of-faith/index.html">Disney-ization of Faith:</a>magic moments, theme park, kitsch, and entertainment.</p>
<p>If you google &#8220;Synagogue Transformation&#8221; you see that it was the buzz word for the last decade in liberal congregations. The successful <em>STAR (Synagogues: Transformation and Renewal) </em>brought in a variety of parallel programs called The Synaplex Initiative.  Similar efforts were done by <em>Synagogue 3000</em> and the United Synagogue. But they claimed to be doing something new. Here we have the OU claiming that turning the Orthodox synagogue is not a new act or transformation “rather to inspire a shul to become what it always was supposed to be.” </p>
<p>The director states “If there’s a book out there that relates to synagogue growth in any way, I’ll read it,” This means, and the language of this announcement shows, that he read all the books by the liberal movements and the Mega Church Evangelicals.<br />
Shavuot night moves from an evening of Torah study to a midnight BBQ, one creates a Menorah Building Contest, a Latke Cook-Off; and a great debate on the Maccabees.  </p>
<p>Or one creates a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/shirashlomo?feature=mhum#p/a/u/0/x-5Gb0vj02A">Rock and Roll Shabbaton</a> as the director of Wings does. <a href="http://www.wsisny.org/component/civicrm/?task=civicrm%2Fevent%2Finfo&amp;reset=1&amp;id=77">(flier)</a><br />
Who   Roger Daltrey of THE WHO<br />
Joshua Nelson  Rock Gospel Chazan<br />
David Fishof &#8211; Producer of VH1 Rock N&#8217; Roll Fantasy Camp<br />
Elan Atias &#8211; Lead Singer of Bob Marley and The Wailers<br />
Ellen Foley  &#8211; &#8220;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&#8221; Co Singer<br />
There will also be a Comedy Shabbaton in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>I guess this is what an Orthodox Synagogue was “Always supposed to be.” This will be the new model of Centrist synagogue, more like the entertainment mega-Church.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ou.org/general_article/new_ou_wings_program_invites_synagogues_to_soar">NEW OU WINGS PROGRAM INVITES SYNAGOGUES TO SOAR</a></p>
<p>Just as synagogues provide the spiritual means for their congregations to soar, the Orthodox Union, in one of its newest and most ambitious initiatives, has established the WINGS program to guide the synagogues themselves to rise to new heights. WINGS… is an acronym for “We Inspire New Growth Synagogues,” with “new growth” referring to shuls of any age or size, as long as they have the outlook and attitude to be inspired – and to soar. </p>
<p>“The title ‘we inspire’ is meant to reflect just that,” declared Rabbi Shlomo Einhorn, the rabbi of Manhattan’s West Side Institutional Synagogue, who is Project Director of Wings. “We’re not claiming we can transform a shul, but rather to inspire a shul to become what it always was supposed to be.”</p>
<p>In the five years since he arrived at the West Side Institutional Synagogue, Shabbat morning attendance has increased from 12 to over 300. “It’s been going amazing there,” Rabbi Einhorn says. He came with the background to build a congregation. “I’ve been watching rabbis and shuls since I was a kid, observing what shuls do wrong and what shuls do right,” he explained. </p>
<p>Rabbi Einhorn has supplemented his first-hand knowledge with intensive study. “If there’s a book out there that relates to synagogue growth in any way, I’ll read it,” he says, adding that he’s already read more than 1,000 books on the subject. “The content of what I give comes from taking a lot of time listening to a lot of shuls, hearing their struggles and their challenges, how they face them and how they respond to these challenges.”</p>
<p>For example, for each holiday WINGS compiles a listing of best practices. For Chanukah, suggestions included a Family Friday Night, a Carnival, a Creative Menorah Building Contest, a Latke Cook-Off; and a great debate on the Maccabees.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is all connected to the book HOLY IGNORANCE By Olivier Roy, which was reviewed by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/books/review/Wolfe-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=review">Alan Wolfe in today’s NYT book review</a>. (subscription required). Roy claims that today’s Evangelical and Orthodox religions are themselves secularized into the consumer market.  No one is going back to the Bible rather into ever newer consumer cultural forms. Much of Centrist Orthodoxy is moving forward by ever greater identification with consumer religion. True frumkeit will be determined by whether one takes part in these cruise ship entertainments.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every winter Fox News, seeking to stir up anger through the land, uncovers evidence of a war on Christmas. Secular humanists ignorant of religion and hostile to its traditions, someone in the studio will declare, want us to say “Happy Holiday” or give Kwanzaa equal standing. But Christmas, as its name suggests, is about Christ. These enemies of Christianity will stop at nothing to get their way. Not even Santa Claus is sacred to them. </p>
<p>Actually, as the brilliant French social scientist Olivier Roy points out in “Holy Ignorance,” it is those defending Christmas who are not being true to their traditions and teachings. There are no Christmas dinners in the Bible, which is why America’s Puritans, strict adherents of what that venerated text offers, never sat down by the raging fire awaiting St. Nick; indeed, they briefly banned Christmas in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>Yule as we celebrate it today owes more to Charles Dickens than to Thomas Aquinas. Our major solstice holiday is what Roy calls a “cultural construct” rather than a sectarian ceremony, which explains why Muslims buy halal turkeys and Jews transformed Hanukkah into a gift-giving occasion. Mistakenly believing that Christmas is sacred, those who defend it find themselves propping up the profane. The Christ they want in Christmas is a product not of Nazareth but of Madison Avenue. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, a number of theories have been offered about the rise of fundamentalism. Roy proposes the most original — and the most persuasive. Fundamentalism, in his view, is a symptom of, rather than a reaction against, the increasing secularization of society.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>EJ the important blog commenter sent in the following guest post. I will offer a little intro on Rawls and then blog his comments. This is one of the pillar&#8217;s of EJ&#8217;s thought along with certain parts of Lacan. A yearning for a more Rawlsian halakhah.</p>
<p>The Harvard ethicist John Rawls was required reading in ethics, politics, law school for decades and was treated as open of the starting positions for political and juridical discourse. He offered a humanistic Kantianism based on equality, fairness, and justice. For many, it was a natural synthesis with Telshe, Brisk, or Maimonides. Rawl’s <em>Theory of Justice</em> (1971) was based on defining justice as treating others with fairness. Fairness was to be decided from what he called the “original position,” one makes decisions without knowing where in society one would fall. One created abstract principles of fairness not knowing where you would be in society. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(philosophy)#Kant_.28and_modern_philosophy.29">For Kant, transcendence</a> means beyond what our faculty of knowledge can legitimately know).</p>
<p><em>John Rawls&#8217; Method</p>
<p>We are to imagine ourselves in what Rawls calls the Original Position. We are all self-interested rational persons and we stand behind &#8220;the Veil of Ignorance.&#8221; To say that we are self-interested rational persons is to say that we are motivated to select, in an informed and enlightened way, whatever seems advantageous for ourselves.<br />
To say that we are behind a Veil of Ignorance is to say we do not know the following sorts of things: our sex, race, physical handicaps, generation, social class of our parents, etc. But self-interested rational persons are not ignorant of (1) the general types of possible situations in which humans can find themselves; (2) general facts about human psychology and &#8220;human nature&#8221;. </p>
<p>Self-interested rational persons behind the Veil of Ignorance are given the task of choosing the principles that shall govern actual world. Rawls believes that he has set up an inherently fair procedure here. Because of the fairness of the procedure Rawls has described, he says, the principles that would be chosen by means of this procedure would be fair principles. </p>
<p>A self-interested rational person behind the Veil of Ignorance would not want to belong to a race or gender or sexual orientation that turns out to be discriminated-against. Such a person would not wish to be a handicapped person in a society where handicapped are treated without respect. So principles would be adopted that oppose discrimination. </p>
<p>Likewise, a self-interested rational person would not want to belong to a generation which has been allocated a lower than average quantity of resources. So (s)he would endorse the principle: &#8220;Each generation should have roughly equal resources&#8221; or &#8220;Each generation should leave to the next at least as many resources as they possessed at the start.&#8221; </p>
<p>John Rawls&#8217; principles of justice.<br />
Rawls argues that self-interested rational persons behind the veil of ignorance would choose two general principles of justice to structure society in the real world:<br />
1) Principle of Equal Liberty: Each person has an equal right to the most extensive liberties compatible with similar liberties for all. (Egalitarian.)<br />
2) Difference Principle: Social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity.<br />

For those who want more &#8211; here is the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#JusFaiJusWitLibSoc">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Rawls.</a></em></p>
<p><strong>EJ’s post</strong></p>
<p><strong>I find these five ideas useful in stating my moral complaints against certain types of Orthodoxy. I could probably organize a moralizing blog explaining why and how Jews are screwing up their future by everyone trying to get an edge on the other guy.</strong><br />
(1) endorsement of a morality defined by interpersonal relations rather than by pursuit of the highest good; (2) insistence on the importance of the separateness of persons, so that the moral community or community of faith is a relation among distinct individuals; (3) rejection of the concept of society as a contract or bargain among egoistic individuals; (4) condemnation of inequality based on exclusion and hierarchy; (5) rejection of the idea of merit.</p>
<p>Enclosed are 3 recent examples where I try to adapt Rawls in a comment.</p>
<p>1…R. Maryles…If you want to give up racism you have to give up the idea that others exist for the sake of frum Jews. Let&#8217;s not even talk about blacks&#8230;you don&#8217;t even see the 12 million Jews who are not Orthodox as ends in themselves. Their tachlis is to become frum through kiruv. As Rashi says, God created the world bishvil yisrael shenikra rashis, and yisrael in your theology equals Centrists..  </p>
<p><strong>Human beings don&#8217;t exist for the sake of confirming anyone&#8217;s beliefs. They are ends in themselves and are to be treated as such.  </strong><br />
I can&#8217;t say this Kantian idea is the correct hashkafah, that&#8217;s for rabbis to decide. But if you reject this idea,<strong> if you believe the world is structured as a hierarchy, to the point where this hierarchy is an adequate reason for acting, then you have no systemic grounded way to confront racism. </strong> </p>
<p>2…R. Maryles…Hillel said, &#8220;That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow.&#8221; Many here seem to agree they don&#8217;t want Lubavitch mucking about with their own kids or with other kids from their stripe, like the bocherim in YU. The solution is not to turn around and do something that Lubavitch will find unpleasant.  </p>
<p>A group proselytizes when they think the children are a davar shel hefker, i.e. the parents do not have the exclusive right to raise their children in accordance with the parents ends and values. Orthodox hold it is a mitzvah to be mekarev non-orthodox kids; they and their parents are tinok shahnishbas and because of their ignorance of the truth, the parents have no legitimate say in how their children should live. Centrists also feel they have a right to be influence young charedim to become more centrist&#8230;go to work, join the army, get a secular education. Charedim, rosh yeshivas feel it is OK to turn MO students into Charedim. But when some group like Lubavitch feels they have the  hegemonic rights of turning klal yisrael into Lubavitchers, and then come into Centrist or Charedi communities, many, maybe most, are up in arms. You don’t die from a contradiction, so maybe this is just the way it is.   </p>
<p><strong>This entire mess comes from treating people as means.  Each and every person and certainly each and every Jew is an end in himself, and his freely chosen values ought to be respected. When two people meet, each viewed as an end in themselves, kiruv is not unidirectional. Like all human interactions both parties can change. ” </strong></p>
<p>3…XGH… This is how I see your problem. You are caught between two poles, neither of which are acceptable. You feel Torah is not real in some common sense plus empiricist conception of the real. Take that as a starting point. You also feel Torah is not imaginary, it&#8217;s much more than a novel by Dickens. How to take hold of the middle, what Lacan calls the symbolic world, the world of society, law, tradition, language. These are social constructs. Even if not real-real, they are kind of important. Try not paying your taxes or lying to the bank. We live in this symbolic world. Death, physics dog shit (to use some of Lacan&#8217;s examples) are real, but who would want to embrace only this world.  </p>
<p><strong>So the task is how to make a symbolic world, like the world of Judaism, justified in some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(philosophy)#Kant_.28and_modern_philosophy.29">transcendental way</a>, or noumenal way? This was in effect Kant&#8217;s problem about morality. All through the 19th century Jews remained neo-Kantians, the most famous being Hermann Cohen, the subject of RJBS&#8217;s dissertation.</strong> Today Rav Kook, pantheism, Rav Nahman, Art Green, and kabbalah are in, Kant is out of favor. </p>
<p>An article that I found moving, and is in a Kantian mode is this one about the young <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5931573.ece">John Rawls and his religion.</a> The Christian part is clearly marked and not essential. Even without knowing much about his ideas, I think it can be understood.  </p>
