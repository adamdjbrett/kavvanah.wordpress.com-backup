				<p><strong>That 70’s Show</strong><br />
Over thirty years ago, I visited an acquaintance for an evening at Ohr Sameach  in Jerusalem. He had in his room a book from the  yeshiva’s library by David Hartman called <em>Joy and Responsibility</em> (1976). The book was published by Bnai –Brith in conjunction with the newly formed Mechon Hartman. At the time of publication Hartman was still involved in outreach and Shappels and Hamivtar were recent offshoots of his Mechon. Hartman rewrote the book a second time as <em>Israelis and the Jewish Tradition</em>  (1990), by that point I was interested in Hasidism and Ohr Sameach would not stock his book since the update contained many new ideas on pluralism, revelation, and halakhah. The book has been rewritten a third time as   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/From-Defender-Critic-Search-Jewish/dp/1580235158"><em>From Defender to Critic: The Search for a New Jewish Self</em></a> in which he softens many of his previous statements returning us to the 1970’s.  </p>
<p>The new book is a quick read especially if you have read some of Hartman’s prior works. He opens up by reiterating that Christians need to learn to understand how halakhah is the essence of Judaism and that we find our religious joy in the law. Hartman asserts that properly understood, Jews should be attracted to the this-worldly, democratic, and rational world of the halakhah as presented by Maimonides and Rav Soloveitchik. Once again in this book, Hartman returns to his break with Lakewood of the 1960’s by seeking modern philosophy, psychology and science.  (It would be worthwhile to compare Hartman to <a href="../../../../2012/01/15/rav-soloveitchik-speaks-to-mental-health-professionals-1978/index.html">Rav Soloveitchik’s 1978 lecture to Mental Health Professionals</a> for the similaritiies).  </p>
<p>I never got around to writing my own opinion on his last work <em>The God Who Hates Lies</em> written <a href="../../../../2011/07/01/interview-with-charlie-buckholtz-co-author-of-new-book-with-david-hartman/index.html">in conjunction with Charlie Buckholtz,</a> because I could not grasp it or pin it down. Buckholtz framed it as if Hartman followed Rackman’s pragmatism yet Hartman still loyally follows the method, if not content, of the existential abstractions of Rav Soloveitchik. Buckholtz makes Hartman sound like Heschel’s piety, and he leaves open details of stories that weakens it rather than strengthens it. For example, think of the story in the last book where Hartman declares that a kohen cannot marry his fiancé as unethical. We are left guessing if he constructed a leniency based on Rabbenu Tam (which is what he did as RCA member) or he jettisons halakhah before his ethical voice. I did, however, learn from the last book how many young rabbis in the field are still followers of Hartman. </p>
<p>This book is easy to form an opinion about its contents. In the book, Hartman basically tones down his prior radicalism and his questioning the system. It is a return to the 1970’s. This book could have been used for discussion in the nostalgic Edah organization, since defunct, because it is once again “the courage to be modern and orthodox.” Halakhah can assert itself against the 1950’s and be pluralistic, individualistic, and this-worldly.</p>
<p>The last chapter on universalism and particularism sums up my problem with the book. He discusses the particularism of his Lakewood background and calls for a more open view of gentiles. To which he proffers the solution of Samson Raphael Hirsch. Where are the books authored by your own Machon on the topic? Where are the 25 years of results from your annual interfaith conferences? The book is a return to the 1970’s. Hartman only uses and responds to Urbach, Scholem, and early Fackenheim. But your own institution has produced scholars who have changed the nature of the study Rabbinic thought, you have Idel on the staff, and you have encouraged your students to produce books on pluralism. Where is your own self-reflections on what you have created? All the new institutions in Israel follow your model for teaching halakhah with philosophic questions, did it work? Did you come up with anything beyond Hirsch?</p>
<p>The other chapters have ideas we have seen before. The book advocates a Hartman’s understanding of Soloveitchik’s approach to Halakhah as a basis for all movements and a commitment to a halakhic future of Judaism. The need to translate Torah into a language intelligible by those not part of the closed world of Torah; Torah cannot be just for the few. Even if most Jews do not accept the metaphysics and doctrines of Judaism because one is modern, one can still be part of the process. Instead of focusing on God, focus on our collective responsibility. Focus on Abraham who fought with God to save the people of Sodom, not just the submissive Abraham.  Instead of focusing on revelation, focus on the responsibility of the halakhah Instead of Berkovits’ revelation as a paradox of God infinite given to the human finite, we have revelation as showing how finite and limited we are- therefore don’t look for absolutes. (He does not even cite his more strident <em>A Living Covenant</em> in this book.) And redemption is a this-worldly making Israel and the world better through halakhah.</p>
<p>In keeping with his pluralism, Hartman jettisons the sense of certainty that one associates with Orthodoxy. It is his claim that one may believe that halakhic Judaism is the best for oneself, but not necessarily the best for everyone. A healthy Orthodoxy, therefore, should be able to accept and legitimate the &#8220;dignified other&#8221; among the Jewish people. David Hartman thinks a reapproachment between religion and political liberalism is possible. And unlike his view of Lakewood in the 1960’s as stifling creativity and individuality, Hartman proclaims an individualistic Orthodoxy that works for the good of all Israel.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we can assume that it is possible for individuals to agree on what they reject, without acknowledging what they affirm, we may be able to create a shared theology of the repudiation of idolatry, without demanding a clearly defined commitment to belief in God. The believer can share common aspirations with the atheist and the agnostic, if all three strive to reject idolatry. This striving can have great significance and far-ranging consequences if the idolatry that is combatted is luring, and constitutes a vital problem to be eradicated (1978, p. 147).</p></blockquote>
<p>In a review of the 1990 version, Arnie Eisen, current chancellor of JTSA, notes that Hartman does not accept a Biblical Judaism without Rabbinics, nor does he allow Buber, Rosenzweig, or other liberal thinkers to speak for Judaism. Eisen does capture how Hartman rewrites tradition but preserves it content. </p>
<blockquote><p>Hartman is not willing to say (in my words): &#8220;God commanded mizvot on Sinai, so they are binding on every Jew,&#8221; or to insist that Judaism offers the finest path to God and the good life, let alone the only path. But he can, and does, say something like this (my words again): &#8220;Judaism&#8217;s distinctive way of standing before God, fashioned by the rabbis, involves the communal performance of mizvot. Choosing to fulfill our part of the covenant as part of a community, therefore, provides as much intimacy with God and as much moral worth as human beings are privileged to know. Each Jew who chooses not to take on that way of standing before God, in Israel, where community is best accomplished, must give a satisfactory account of why not.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>On the topic of feminism, he footnotes his daughter but makes no use of her work. He argues that for our daughters we cannot return to our bubbis and grandmothers Torah.  He uses as his example of a mistaken approach Rav Kook’s  banning women from voting as the definitive halakhah.  Where is the last forty years?</p>
<p>Hartman articulates the ethical dilemma better than others and acknowledges the difference between himself and the texts:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with attempting to use internal mechanisms within the tradition to resolve moral quandaries is that the moral problematic is never named, much less explicitly critiqued, Engaging authentically with our most sacred book means acknowledging when it arouses our sense of injustice or compassion—and admitting that some of its injunctions may be flawed. ..the tradition cant save itself from itself.” </p></blockquote>
<p>But for the answer of how to overcome this difference, the problem of difficult texts has been with us for decades and there are many answers. Even on this blog, last week we had Yehuda Gellman arguing, seemingly like Hartman, those immoral texts were divine concession to that era, while Fleishacker preserves the morality of revelation and sees the potholes as part of a system to be maintained even if reinterpreted. </p>
<p>Finally, the title of the book implies Hartman recently moved from defender to critic, rather than forty years ago. I mentioned the title to a friend, who said that this is the theme of forthcoming books. Many who became observant in the 1980’s and 1990’s have moved from defenders to critics after all the immoral behavior within the community, the conversion crisis, and the provincialism of the community. Hartman’s became a critic before the era of Rabbis Eliashiv or Yitzhak Shapira, before the community was used to seeing members arrested for fraud, and before the quest for doctrinal and legal purity started.  Hartman’s title implied that he would deal with these issues. What are his answers to these new questions? </p>
<p>IF I have already read the books written at Mechon Hartman by Sagi, Halbertal, Lorberbaum, the Zohar brothers, Rosenak, Knohl, and Achitov, Can I return to the 1970&#8217;s questions? This book may be one of the clearest and least controversial presentations of Hartman’s opinions for those looking where to start.  But it also highlights how the issues look different in todays papers or after reading the works produced by his own Mechon. </p>
<p><strong>Addenda</strong><br />
Here is a 1991 interview from the Jerusalem Post in which Hartman distinguishes between the tolerant Orthodoxy of the 1930’s and the recent 1950’s immigrant from Europe who created a closed and frightened reaction. </p>
<p><strong> You are an Orthodox rabbi, yet your practice of Orthodoxy is markedly more tolerant than the Orthodoxy to which we are accustomed. Did you have to struggle against the Orthodox milieu in which you were raised in order to attain this tolerance?</strong></p>
<p>Not at all. There is a tolerant stream in Orthodox Judaism and I was raised in it.<br />
Their closedness is rooted firstly in the most ghetto-bound, diversity-fearing streams of Eastern European Orthodoxy and secondly in a traumatized reaction to the genocide of World War II. This turning inward is very different from the pluralistic Orthodox milieu in which I myself was raised in Brooklyn in the &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s.<br />
The climate in which I was raised was pious, but not in the slightest bit fanatical. Brownsville at that time was filled with all forms of Jews: Socialists, Communists, Bundists. There was no ghetto climate of dogmatism and rejection of those who disagreed with one&#8217;s views. It was a pluralistic community. We played basketball with Blacks and Italians on the streets. There was no &#8220;us and them.&#8221; One could learn from and respect everybody. This is the kind of Orthodoxy which is home to me.<br />
&#8211; Right. We are talking about a far less fanatical and defensive kind of Orthodoxy. World War II made many Orthodox feel a zealous need to preserve a threatened way of life. There are also Orthodox Sephardim who maintain their tradition&#8217;s historic attitude of tolerance.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I have not yet responded to the many comments on my prior post about my <a href="../../../../2012/03/26/a-chat-with-rabbi-shlomo-einhorn/index.html">chat with Rabbi Einhorn</a> ranging from Yehudah’s question on authority to the debate of Neil &amp; Micha on Musar. I will, but first several people have emailed me about some examples of his sermons. Thanks to the files at YUTorah we have examples and from his own<a href="http://socialsermon.com/source/"> Social Sermon Experiment</a> we see that he constructs sermons from discrete parts- story, Torah and joke. They are all good sermonic material. Thoughts?</p>
<p>So from these Neo-Mitnaged sermons, what is the image of the gedolim?</p>
<p>1) I start with the story that the good rabbi quoted both when we met and in an email to illustrate the kind of Torah that he likes- juicy chaps. I mentioned that Rav Soloveitchik would not have considered this activity Torah study. Notice the quoting of the Haredi leader and the complete reversal and undercutting in the telling. The sermon illustrates the poaching and evasion found in popular religion that was discussed by Michel de Certeau- see my prior post on <a href="../../../../2011/02/15/orthodoxy-as-popular-culture-via-certeau/index.html">Certeau and Orthodoxy.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>On occasion I have the challenging, yet rewarding, task of working with at-risk teens. In one pre-Pesach class I decided to present a possibly contentious interpretation of the Haggadah. I was curious to see how these students would react. The interpretation is that of the brilliant Rav Yoel Teitelbaum ZT”L, the Satmar Rov. The Satmar Rov was known for his sharp wit and tough talk. He raises the question of why we perform the yachatz (breaking the middle matzah) before beginning the maggid (recounting of the story of the Exodus) portion of the Haggadah. The Satmar Rov answers that in order to properly begin a holy endeavor we must first discard all that is bad from our midst. We must break off and cast aside the wicked, the apikores, those that tend to bring us down with their moral failings and lack of Jewish observance.</p>
<p>The moment I shared this thought, I could see the blood of my students reddening. But it was the insight of one student, who we shall call David, that shook my perspective of the Passover Seder. David tends to come off as irreverent, lost, and at times depressed. But at this moment he had reached a level of clarity seldom seen by anyone. He turned to me and with blazing passion in his eyes, he said “I disagree! We do not cast away this broken matzah. In fact, we hide it, protect it, and when the time is right – at the highlight of our Seder – Tzafun, the emergence of the Afikomen, we bring that “discarded” one front and center.” We may need an occasional “time out”, but we are never out of love’s reach.<br />
And together we fell to weeping.<br />
&#8212; <a href="http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/736771/Rabbi_Shlomo_Einhorn/Bolt_of_Inspiration_16_-_Haggadah_Special-_The_Wayward_Teen_and_the_Satmar_Rov">from here.</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>2)	This one is good for Passover but more importantly it is a great lead in for a sermon with the content taken from Rabbi David Wolpe. The Belzer teaches us that we find God in sickness, we find God when we take care of the poor, and we find God when we gather with the family around the table. I would suggest looking at Wolpe’s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Faith-Matters-David-Wolpe/dp/B003F76HF2/ref=pd_sim_b_1"><em> Why Faith Matters?</em></a> on the importance of turning to God in health crisis, family, and in social action.</p>
<blockquote><p>R. Yissachar Dov of Belze suggests a beautiful interpretation. The Gemara in Shabbos 12b says that when we go to visit a sick person, one is able to pray in Aramaic because the Divine Presence is above his or her head and therefore the petitioner does not need a ministering angel to bring the prayer to G-d.  The Medrash (Vayikrah Rabbah 34) states – that when a poor person stands at the door, the Divine Presence is there as well.  When we say “All those who are hungry come and eat” – Hashem is standing there! G-d is with us at the Seder.&#8212; <a href="http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/743081/Rabbi_Shlomo_Einhorn/Bolt_of_Inspiration_56_-_G-d_at_the_Seder">from here</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>3)	Here is a sermon that would serve as a good introduction to Tony Robbins and motivational books. Musar teaches that we need our ego to reach higher levels. And we use our own ego to determine how we help the neighbor. It is musar without the puritanical side, without visualizing how you will burn in gehenna, and without the continuation of the homily on the need to generally break your ego.  We have this-worldly growth of ego and community work- the opposite of the original.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Rav Eliyahu Dessler, in a collection of magnificent and creative essays and original letters, asks “why did G-d have to create our Ego so strong?” R. Dessler boldly argues that it is primarily because of our ego that we are able to reach levels of spirituality otherwise unattainable. Our unquenchable thirst for greatness and godliness pushes us beyond our apparent limits. However, left unchecked this ego may go too far. Left unchecked, we may deify ourselves. What keeps us in balance? “Veahavta Leracha Kamocha”, “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” Meaning, use your ego to first ascertain what we would want for ourselves and in that we can figure out what it is that we must do for our neighbor.&#8212; <a href="http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/736765/Rabbi_Shlomo_Einhorn/Bolt_of_Inspiration_10_-_How_to_Use_Your_Ego">from here </a></p></blockquote>
<p>4)	Here are selections from a long sermon that combines Bob Dylan with R.  Yisrael Salanter and have Rav Dessler. The first thing to note is how Dylan’s religion, who treats his Judaism as ethnicity and follows an Evangelical Christianity, is equated with Orthodoxy. Gabriel’s trumpet of 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is labeled as classic musar. Dylan’s Christian songs License to Kill,” and “Blind Willie McTell,” is linked to the depravity of man and the Vilna Gaon demand for constant progress.  The Gra learned day and night without concern for food, family, money, or sleep and in this sermon we have popular American Calvinism.<br />
Rabbi Salanter is presented as about self-improvement without the specifics of the approach in which our imaginations and emotions lead us astray.  Rav Dessler is compared to Dylan’s Idiot Wind. </p>
<blockquote><p>Bob Dylan – The Zemanim they Are a Changin’<br />
The world of Bob Dylan’s songs bring to life a dynamic array of characters, themes, and melodies. But the one constant throughout Bob Dylan’s career, is G-d. While in real life (outside of the printed lyric that is) Bob Dylan’s commitment and connection to Judaism is in some ways mysterious, mercurial, and marginal, as far as his feelings go, Bob Dylan is a religiously inclined individual. He is a man that shows a face interested in the mystical underpinnings of Judaism. He is a man that emerges with ideas that often run congruous to basic Jewish philosophies. He is a man whose yearnings hover surprisingly close to mainstream Orthodox Judaism. </p>
<p>In the 19th Century, Rabbi Yisroel Lipkin, better known as Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, fathered the Mussar movement. This brought a strong and overt focus on ethical development to Judaism. This also meant that one’s flaws were to be highlighted in order to find room for improvement. Maimonides, in his Mishnah Torah, already preempted the overt style of Mussar by noting that the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah was the instrument by which we tell each other – “wake up you sleepers from your slumber.” In the song “Sugar Baby” off of the Love and Theft album, Bob Dylan gives us spiritual council – “Look up, look up &#8211; seek your Maker &#8211; &#8216;fore Gabriel blows his horn.” This is classic Mussar – reproach in its most raw form. </p>
<p>One of the most philosophically challenging issues in Jewish philosophy is the issue of Divine Providence, or G-d’s interaction with humans in their present state. Many of our great sages have debated the level and intensity of Divine intervention. Rav Eliyahu Dessler has argued that hashgacha pratis (Divine guidance) can be broken into two components – that which is evident by the external eye and that which is evident by the internal eye. The external eye seems to tell us that this world is controlled by G-d in every sense. Every move we make, every animal that grazes, every flower that wilts is controlled by G-d. Our internal eye lets us feel that we still have some control, G-d lets some things just be. Rav Dessler further develops the reasoning as to why both perspectives are necessary. Bob Dylan is also stranded between this tension of the internal eye and external eye. This duality is clear in several of his songs. Bob Dylan’s apocalyptical “Masters of War” portrays a demagogue that is physically capable and free to cause havoc upon the world. Still, Dylan realizes the eventual “judgment” awaiting the tyrant as he faces a time of reckoning before G-d. “Idiot Wind,” which is a play on the Talmudic concept of a “ruach shuts,” also works within the balance of this fine line between apparent Divine Determinism and Free Will. </p>
<p>What prolific Jewish author can fairly leave out some treatise on personality traits – or what we call Middos? Bob Dylan spends a considerable amount of time weeding out the traits that distance us from both humankind and our Creator. In the haunting “License to Kill,” Dylan preaches – “Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool And when he sees his reflection, he&#8217;s fulfilled.” This loaded line has dual meaning; it is both an ode to the Vilna Gaon’s statement of stagnancy – “if you are not going up up you are going down down,” and it is a reference to self pride, Gayva, if you will. Dylan’s distaste for depravity continues in his classic “Blind Willie McTell,” – “well, G-d is in heaven And we all want what&#8217;s his but power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.”</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://philosophy.las.uic.edu/people/faculty/samuel-fleischacker/">Samuel Fleischacker,</a> Professor at University of Illinois at Chicago. Fleischacker recived his Ph.D. Yale 1989 and works in moral and political philosophy, the history of philosophy, and the philosophy of religion. His publications include  <a href="http://adamsmithslostlegacy.blogspot.com/2009/07/sam-fleischacker-wins-prestigious-award.html">the award winning</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Smiths-Wealth-Nations-Philosophical/dp/0691115028"><em>On Adam Smith&#8217;s Wealth of Nations: A Philosophical Companion</em></a> (Princeton, 2003), <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7748.html">credited as a major work</a> showing that the Adam Smith of the 20th century economists is not that of Adam Smith himself (<a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7748.pdf">1st chapter as pdf</a>) and <em><a href="http:///www.amazon.com/A-Short-History-Distributive-Justice/dp/0674018311">A Short History of Distributive Justice</a> </em>(Harvard, 2004). Recently, he published <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Religion/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199217366"><em>Divine Teaching and the Way of the World</em> </a>(Oxford, 2011) on revelation in general, but from a Jewish perspective. (For those who want to start with the interesting interview-scroll down.)</p>
<p>In his new book, Samuel Fleischacker defends what the Enlightenment called &#8216;revealed religion&#8217;: religions that regard a certain text or oral teaching as sacred, as wholly authoritative over one&#8217;s life. At the same time, he maintains that revealed religions stand in danger of corruption or fanaticism unless they are combined with secular scientific practices and a secular morality. </p>
<p><em>Divine Teaching and the Way of the World</em> argue that the cognitive and moral practices of a society, meaning ethics and science,  serve as &#8220;way of the world&#8221; (his translation of the Hebrew <em>&#8220;derech eretz,&#8221;</em>) and his motto for the book is &#8220;Beautiful is the study of Torah with <em>derech eretz.</em> The ways of the world (<em>derech eretz</em>) allow human beings to work together regardless of their religious differences. </p>
<p>But according to Fleischacker secular ethics and science breaks down when it comes to the question of what we live for, and it is this that revealed religions can illumine. Fleischacker suggests that secular conceptions of why life is worth living are often poorly grounded.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/29384-divine-teaching-and-the-way-of-the-world-a-defense-of-revealed-religion/">in depth review at NDPR by Yeudah Gellman:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>One of Fleischacker&#8217;s main theses is that these [morals and science] must be in place before a commitment to a text as revelatory. They must, that is, come to religion already equipped with entrenched secular morality and science. Religion cannot make claims against either.</p>
<p>Next, Fleischacker argues that religion provides something that secularism fails to offer successfully &#8212; a telos for the moral life, that which makes living the moral life and life itself meaningful and worthwhile.  He rejects as an adequate telos for life knowledge, pleasure, self-flourishing, projectivism (that we ourselves bestow value on our life), and Kantian accounts of worth.</p>
<p>A revelatory text will emphasize moral values beyond what standard morality does, for example, increased concern for widows and orphans. A revelatory text provides telic direction with the category of the &#8220;holy,&#8221; demanding personal transformation and not only prescribed actions. To say a revelation is &#8220;true&#8221; for Fleischacker, therefore, is not to refer to its historical reliability or its sound moral teachings. (p. 67) Rather, it is to express trust in one&#8217;s telic expectations of it. The text satisfies one&#8217;s &#8220;telic yearnings.&#8221; (p. 308) When a text strikes a person as revelatory, he then has reason to believe in God, for belief in God as the source of the revelation can give the best metaphysical account of the telic truth existing in the text.</p>
<p>Why does he believe the Torah is the word of God? Because it satisfies his &#8220;telic yearnings,&#8221; the story &#8220;rings true&#8221; to him ethically.<br />
Since the morality of a text must precede judging it a revelation, Fleischacker knows he must contend with what he calls the Torah&#8217;s moral &#8220;pockmarks,&#8221; Torah passages he deems morally reprehensible. He notes such passages as the Temple ritual of the accused wife, the command to destroy the people of Amalek, and the command to kill a rebellious son, what he calls a &#8220;notorious text.&#8221;<br />
Here, Fleischacker provides the most intriguing argument in the book. (pp. 327ff.) The moral pockmarks, he says, are an advantage to a revealed text. The moral pockmarks in the Torah protect a Jew from the haughtiness of believing that with the Torah he possesses absolute, perfect truth. Instead, the Jew learns religious humility and tolerance of others. Indeed, the presence of pockmarks calls the Jew to moral and religious responsibility in the task of reinterpretation and furthering progress in the religious life…<br />
Fleischacker focuses especially on systematic problems in Torah legislation, and most especially on what he judges to be sexist, xenophobic, or vengeful passages. His solution is to undertake a reinterpretation of all such passages to bring them into line with secular morality: &#8220;If Maimonides can find a non-anthropomorphic God in the Torah, we should have no trouble finding a non-sexist God there as well.&#8221; (p. 385) Here Fleischacker refers to Maimonides&#8217; extended argument against an anthropomorphic God in The Guide for the Perplexed. Fleischacker believes that Maimonides&#8217; cleansing of anthropomorphism from the Torah was far more difficult than would be cleansing the Torah from what he takes to be sexist, as well as xenophobic and vengeful passages.</p>
<p>The extensive reinterpretations Fleischacker envisions would cause massive changes in Jewish Law (for example, the nature of Jewish marriage) and thus in the &#8220;path&#8221; that Fleischacker is supposed to have identified at the start as worthy of his telic expectations.<br />
Fleischacker calls it a &#8220;child&#8217;s view&#8221; to accept a text as revelation on the grounds that it could not have been authored by a human being. (p. 302) He goes on to reason as follows: “If a text or speech really was such that no human being could possibly have composed it, no human being would be able to understand it either (or, therefore, recognize its truth).” </p>
<p>Fleischacker altogether makes too much of an empirical claim that religious believers perceive morality as preceding revelation. Believers will give many reasons for why they take a text as a revelation, including that they sense God or the Holy Spirit speaking to them through this text, that this truth has been handed down through tradition, or that the person who wrote it was not intellectually capable of creating it on his own. </p>
<p>Fleischacker tells the reader that the Orthodox Jewish community has worked quite hard to minimize sexist aspects of the Torah. This is grossly overstated. Only a small segment of that community has attempted to ameliorate the problems for women in Jewish law, and that within a narrow scope of application. Much of Orthodox Judaism has resisted changes or has been indifferent to the possibility of changes in their religious practice</p>
<p>The central idea of the book&#8230; deserves to be seriously reckoned as a warranted way of coming to believe in revelation and in God…. Fleischacker&#8217;s book should become an object of careful discussion serving for progress in philosophy of religion.</p></blockquote>
<p>1.	<strong>Why did you write the book?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve long felt I needed to explain to myself why I continue to be committed to observant Judaism (in my teens and early twenties, I gave myself reasons for this but have rarely since checked to see whether I still find them cogent). I figured that the answers I came up with might be of use to other similarly-situated religious believers.  As the Orthodox Jewish world has become more and more conservative, moreover, aligning itself increasingly with the Christian right and its rejection of secular science and morality, I&#8217;ve also felt more alienated from it, and worried that an atavistic, thoughtless, and dangerous form of our religion may soon take it over utterly, if liberal voices don&#8217;t speak up.</p>
<p>2.	<strong>What do you think of all the recent “new atheist” books?</strong><br />
I confess I&#8217;ve only glanced at them, not read them through.  Most seem quite silly to me &#8211; with the same sort of shallow understanding of religion that they (rightly) accuse fundamentalists of having of science.  Dennett is something of an exception:  he&#8217;s an antagonist who needs to be reckoned with seriously. The whole debate over theism vs. atheism seems to me not a central Jewish concern:  our issues have more to do with the status of sacred texts (my main concern in the book).</p>
<p>3.	<strong>What is the role of philosophy in your Orthodoxy?</strong><br />
I think philosophy can be helpful to clarifying what we believe &#8211; and in particular to making sure that we bear always in mind that God must be a *moral* God, and that that rules out understanding Him as commanding blatantly immoral actions. (That philosophy clarifies the nature of God seems to me also clearly Maimonides&#8217; main concern.)  I don&#8217;t think philosophy can *ground* our fundamental beliefs.<br />
 I should add, though, that I&#8217;m not sure I really am an &#8220;Orthodox&#8221; Jew &#8211; I prefer saying &#8220;halachic Jew&#8221; or just that I am shomer shabbat. </p>
<p>4.	<strong>What if an Orthodox skeptic objected to your work and say that the position that you label as childish belief is what orthodoxy is about and your philosophic belief is not Orthodox?</strong><br />
I would urge such a skeptic to read the Rambam (and all his followers, and Hirsch and Soloveitchik;  and the Ramban and Sfas Emes, for that matter) &#8211; what I criticize as &#8220;childish&#8221; religion is very much what they too all avoid and try to wean us from.  But what I call &#8220;the child&#8217;s view of revelation&#8221; is also something that I think has a legitimate place in any religious person&#8217;s life.  One simply needs to balance it against the understanding that there is no revelation without interpretation:  that the process of interpretation is something that God Himself must want us to engage in.  This is actually a very Jewish view, and the chapter of my book that elaborates it (&#8220;Receiving Revelation,&#8221; in Part IV) is not coincidentally the chapter that uses the most Jewish sources.</p>
<p>5.<strong>How can you bracket out history and theology from a defense of revelation and Torah at Sinai?  Don&#8217;t you need to show why it is reasonable to believe in God, and the historicity of the events at Sinai?&#8221; By definition does it not need a historic truth claim?</strong></p>
<p>No, I think historic claims can be entirely bracketed from our understanding of Torah as divine &#8211; even from what we mean by &#8220;Torah from Sinai.&#8221;  The main point is that the Torah is *authoritative* and that doesn&#8217;t need a historic warrant (once again, I&#8217;d pull in the Rambam in support of this claim).<br />
Unlike Gelman, I have doubts about whether we have, independently of revelation, a clear, coherent conception of God.  My reasons for this are roughly Wittgensteinian:  I don’t think the ordinary use of words like “powerful” and “good” allow readily for formations like “all-powerful” and “all-good.”  As regards goodness, I’m not even sure our ordinary uses of the term are coherent — a central line of argument in the book raises questions about whether we have a firm grip on what “goodness” means, independently of revelation.  If revelation teaches us what makes our lives worth living, as I claim it does, then it teaches us what we mean by “the good” as well, or how we are most likely to find out.  But if that is right, then we presumably learn what “God” properly means — if we are theists — from revelation.  </p>
<p>6. <strong>&#8220;How can you bracket out the non-moral &#8220;historical pockmarks&#8221; of the Torah?  How do you respond to Gellman&#8217;s suggestion that we read them as tacked on to God&#8217;s true words by flawed human authors?&#8221;</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t bracket out historic pockmarks:  I think God wants us to retain our history as we move into the future, and the pockmarks are a way of ensuring that we always do that.  We just need to interpret them carefully.<br />
Gellman&#8217;s insistence that the revelation is immoral as it stands seems to want to take us back on the well-worn path trodden by liberal Protestants and Reform Jews in the 19th and early 20th centuries. According to which real revelation comes to us though autonomous reason or personal experience, and our supposedly sacred texts are inadequate attempts by our ancestors to express that revelation.  This path leads one quickly to abandon the notion of a revealed text.  If we are going to see our texts as the paths to the highest good, it is essential that we submit in humility to them, and seek a way out of the moral difficulties they pose from within them, rather than writing out bits as “tacked on.”<br />
I argue that while believers tend to point first to the moral content of their revelations, what in fact is most important about those revelations is not something moral:  it is a vision of the highest good that complements morality.  But visions of this sort pervade a sacred text, rather than being located in particular verses, and are clarified and extended over time by a communal tradition of interpretation.  So they can be used to downplay or revise verses that conflict with our way-of-the-world morality — and are so used, in every religious tradition with which I am acquainted.  </p>
<p>7.	<strong>What is your understanding of truth? </strong><br />
I don&#8217;t *define* truth, strictly speaking, but stress its use, ordinarily, in contexts in which we urge others to put trust in a statement or speaker.  The Torah then is &#8220;true&#8221; in the sense that it is trustworthy (a trustworthy guide to life).  </p>
<p>8.	<strong>If, according to your book, we need to start with an ethical approach before approaching Torah, then what use is Torah in fighting the immoral world we live in? </strong><br />
What leads people to immorality is not *ignorance* of what is right but selfishness, self-deception, arrogance, and ideologies that feed these evil human drives.  The Torah can very much help us struggle against these tendencies in its fierce opposition to idolatry &#8211; ultimately, self-worship (projecting your own drives and desires as absolute goods &#8211; gods &#8211; in place of the one true God) &#8211; and many ways of urging us instead to cultivate benevolence and humility (anavah:  the great trait of Moshe;  we should also remember that the rabbis compare anger to idolatry).  The huge mistake we often make, the great yetzer hara that tempts religious people as much as anything, is projecting the evils of our world only outward, on non-Jews or insufficiently religious or loyal Jews, instead of seeing them in everyone, including Orthodox Jews, and working above all on restraining them in ourselves.</p>
<p>9.	<strong>How would you respond to a frum skeptic that repeats the arguments of Hume, Hobbes and the new atheists, without having any knowledge of philosophy.</strong><br />
Our tradition values knowledge extremely highly:  being an am ha-aretz is famously worse than being an epikoros.  To anyone who prides himself on his skepticism without having bothered to get to know the religions he&#8217;s dismissing, the only answer can be:  go and learn.<br />
Far and away the single best recent book on theism and revelation, in my opinion, is <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195153715.001.0001/acprof-9780195153712">Robert Adams&#8217; FINITE AND INFINITE GOODS;</a>  I used it a lot.  Adams is a Christian philosopher, however (albeit very knowledgeable about Judaism).</p>
<p>10.	<strong>Can we use Maimonides today?</strong><br />
I think Maimonides *is* dated &#8211; his argument for God especially so &#8211; and in crucial ways my book opposes his views rather than supporting them (above all, I think the central mental faculty for religious commitment is the imagination, not the understanding:  which has a host of consequences that make for a much less austere, more humanistic conception of religion, and a more important role for ritual than he has).  But he sets a wonderful model of how one can work to re-interpret basic Jewish texts and ideas in the light of the best philosophy and science of one&#8217;s day.  Philosophy and science have however changed radically since the 12th century, so a true Maimonidean today should be interpreting our texts and ideas in a very different light.  In particular, it&#8217;s a mistake &#8211; I think &#8211; to use any arguments for God other than Kant&#8217;s moral one.</p>
<p>11.	<strong>Do you see the Orthodox community as ethical? If not, does this impact your philosophy?</strong><br />
I see *parts* of the Orthodox community as ethical:  certain Orthodox people &#8211; rabbis as well as laypeople &#8211; have indeed been important moral role models for me.  But we have a great and growing problem with deeply immoral attitudes toward non-Jews, which shows up sometimes in contemptuous and inhumane treatment of non-Jewish workers at Orthodox establishments in the US, and &#8211; more dramatically and pervasively &#8211;  in an the unbelievably brutal and unjust treatment that large parts of the Orthodox community in Israel have been inflicting on Palestinians:  the greatest crime, I think, that Jews have committed as a community in the past two millennia of our history.  As I watch this get worse and worse, with few leading figures speaking out even tepidly against it, I feel my ability to maintain a commitment to halacha becoming extremely strained.  </p>
<p>12.	<strong>What do you think of the relationship of Judaism or Torah to distributive justice? What seems mandated? What is a new idea that can or cannot be applied to Talmudic law?</strong> There is a full summary of Fleischacker&#8217;s work on <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6395/is_2_33/ai_n29350788/?tag=content;col1">distributive justice in this review.</a></p>
<p>I think that, like members of all other religious traditions, we Jews have learned have from the secular world on this. What I tried to show in my book on distributive justice is that it took people who were moving away from all religious traditions to make clear to all of us that we have a duty to get rid of poverty altogether, if possible, not just to give charity and certainly not to give charity just to members of our own communities.  But the Jewish tradition &#8211; by giving poor people an enforceable right to certain kinds of tzedakah &#8211; came closer to anticipating modern notions of distributive justice than pre-modern Christianity did.<br />
I also think the very powerful idea, which we are about to celebrate, that we need to treat the oppressed and miserable with decency and justice because we were once oppressed ourselves provides a great basis for imagining ourselves into the shoes of the poor rather than dismissing them with the complacent platitudes that come readily to the lips of people who are themselves comfortable (&#8220;they drink&#8221;;  &#8220;they don&#8217;t take care of their children&#8221;;  &#8220;they have low IQs&#8221;).</p>
<p>Fleischacker will be responding to Gellman this Wed at the Pacific APA. Here on the East coast, I would like a 50 page article summarizing for classroom use the almost 600 pages of the book.  </p>

				<p><strong>And your eyes shall see your teacher, Isaiah 30:20</strong></p>
<p>Rabbi Shlomo Einhorn, mara d’atra of the West Side Institutional Synagogue, and I have been in email correspondence for over a year and a half and we were never able to fix a time to meet. So, before he leaves town to his new pulpit and before I have deadlines for the next book we found time to meet.  He chose the place to meet, the swank <a href="http://www.mandarinoriental.com/newyork/dining/lobby_lounge/">lounge at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel</a> overlooking Central Park.</p>
<p>In the background to our meeting was my monitoring his high-profile synagogue events that use popular culture, his lecturing on pop-psych, and his general trendiness in his programming. He offers a model of a popular culture Orthodox Rabbi to contrast with the Evangelical Orthodox Rabbi or Oprah Orthodox rabbi.  His model is so popular and useful that the OU has given him his own group, program, and <a href="http://www.ou.org/general_article/new_ou_wings_program_invites_synagogues_to_soar">website called Wings</a> to work with synagogues training and retraining personal and clergy into the new approaches. The OU website describes Einhorn  as a musician, “as having developed a critically &#8220;Simcha Seminar,&#8221; authored multiple books, released a CD and grown his shul by more than 70% in the past four years. On his blog, Rabbi Einhorn shares his thoughts and his research on how to be productive and imbue everything you touch with success.”</p>
<p>I came into the meeting expecting to talk about popular culture, sports, and entertainment and instead found myself discussing spiritual seeking and how to learn from the lives of the gedolim. I also was surprised to be hearing a spiritual autobiography in progress.</p>
<p>Einhorn describes the need for his age group, the younger gen x  and older gen y rabbis to seek the experiential.  They grew up with a strict halakhic diet and a rationalist worldview which did not sustain their cravings for religious experience that they were taught to value in Israel. They moved from ipad and MTV to a year in Israel where they acquired black hats, allegiance to rabbinic authority and complete submission to Torah. But they also developed a yearning for the spirituality they found in Rav Zilberstein with his ecstatic third meals in darkness or the tisch kabbalah of Rav Morgenstein or Rav Moshe Wolfson. They were not attracted to the slow study of classic Kabbalaistic texts rather the saintliness and supernaturalism. They loved the emotional devotionalism of zaddikim. The recently deceased  Steipler, Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky (d.1985) offered a role model of the aspirational goals of the Yeshiva experience.</p>
<p>Living in a post-lummdus age, Einhorn like the Torah that he learns and teaches to be the short sound bites. Great single paragraph “juicy chaps” as he calls them and he wants them to also have a practical difference. His seforim shelf includes: Rabbi Abba Mordechai Berman, <em>Shiurei Iyun Hatalmud</em>, <a href="http://www.ou.org/index.php/jewish_action/article/57216">Businessman Zvi Ryzman</a> <em>Ratz</em> <em>keTzvi</em>, R. Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, <em>Mishmeres Chaim</em> and R. Yoav Joshua Weingarten, <em>Sefer Kaba de-kashyata</em>.  His tastes are part a return to Polish Hasidic Torah and part contemporary Haredi. In haskafah, he likes Rav Dessler <em>Miktav miEliyahu</em> and Rav Schwatz’s  <em>Bilvavi.</em> Like a Polish Rabbi, he attempts to finish Shas once a year And unlike a Brisker approach, he returns Torah to its thick weave of unrelated questions and answers, satisfied with a cleaver answer.  Einhorn attended the non-hesder Ohr Yerushalayim and then YU, spending four years under Rav Schachter, but this method seems more reflective of his generation that was no longer satisfied with halakhah or the rationality of Hesder or Lumdus approaches.</p>
<p>His is a generation that did not know the lumdus of Rav Soloveitchik, the heart of Reb Shlomo Carlebach, or a regular Shabbos in Modzitz. Nor do they know the third meal in darkness from  the old-time world of Satmar, the Bobover rebbe or mussar.  Their character formation was in the beis medrash in gap-year programs in Israel and they returned  to the US – either YU or Ner Yisrael to complete their formation as a ben Torah. They continued college in the same natural, but sheltered, way that they achieved high school, as something that is done. But they are outside of high culture, and lack any rubric for philosophy, psychology, or religion. He represents a generation wide-eyed in search of its own spirituality.</p>
<p>Einhorn found his spirituality when he discovered the world of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Favorite-Motivational-Management-Books/lm/R2MA0VFBNMWHQJ">motivational management books</a> and could not get enough of them. He devoured the books on how to improve one’s leadership, how to motivate those under you and how to push yourself to your potential.  An action centered gregarious form of self-fulfillment in the real world. He also read Rick Warren and the other motivational Evangelical but they were only part of the broader quest for tips and ideas for self-motivation.</p>
<p>Rabbi Einhorn is absolutely sold on <a href="http://singularcity.com/walk-barefoot-on-red-hot-coals-and-be-transformed/">Tony Robbins’s program for fire-walking</a> to be transformed and to release the potential within. Not only has he undergone the fire-walking seminar, he encourages other Orthodox rabbis to do the same. Einhorn has also attended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Education">Landmark seminars</a> (a derivative from Werner Erhard’s EST) and appreciates the importance of Neuro-Linguistic Programing for motivating others. (Be prepared for ever new emphasis on emotional manipulation in the Orthodox youth organizations.)</p>
<p>For Einhorn, these seminars show our potential to grow in our service to God and be like the gedolim. If we overcome our fears and hesitance we can be anything. The conversation in the cocktail lounge was entirely on the amazing heights of the gedolim and their worship of God; they lived up to the potential human in their service. Rarely was Torah mentioned, the focus was on avodah.  He rejoiced in telling me how he was using social media to get people to click on pictures of gedolim they liked. For Einhorn, even though the Gedolim are anti-modern anti-social, and certainly anti-social media, we use social media to spread a need to serve God the way the gedolim do. Gedolim don’t do facebook but they have the worship of God that we want. We shared a common interest in the need for exemplarily of saints as a necessity in the religious life.</p>
<p>I asked him: what is the avodah, the service of God that he seeks and preaches? He answered: Meaning in their everyday life.  I asked: Like Victor Frankl? Einhorn answered: “I want people to find meaning in life like Rabbi David Wolpe teaches.” He has met Wolpe and is especially proud that Wolbe has quoted him. Yet, he consistently puts Wolpe’s teaching in the mouth of the Gedolim because they are frum and offer an imaginary ideal of a humanistic way to serve God. Wolpe is not connected to the gedolim so his message has to be put in their mouth. Wolpe runs Friday night live as entertainment but achieves religious commitment,  Einhorn does the same.  Yet I ask: Why cant it be done in the name of Wolpe, admit you differ with him over theology and mizvot and that you have a deep ideological divide but your results match his and not that of Rav Eliyashiv?</p>
<p><strong>What is avodah?  It deals with our deep issues, all of life is an avodah, not just the finding of mizvot in our day but the process of fully living.  God is in the heart and the currencies of the heart are inspiration, peak moments, life’s meanings and our personal relationship with God.</strong></p>
<p>Einhorn repeated several times that his presentations of the gedolim, whether the Steipler or Rav Eliashiv is imaginary. They serve as aspirational foci but Einhorn bears no responsibility for the actual ascetic, stringent, and anti-social life of the gedolim.</p>
<p>The source for his daily examples of how to live life are from Rock stars, athlete,  celebrities, and other avatars of pop culture. They are the appropriate mussar  to reaches us where we are at. According to Einhorn, the rock stars are not the source for how to lead our daily lives, gedolim are. He uses lyrics, especially the ability to tap into deep wells of angst or hope, to point us in the direction of doing the things the gedolim do.Bono’s religious quest is ideal for sermons. Yet, it is important to note that many Evangelical leaders are weary of Bono, despite his religious quest, because he “still hasn’t found what he is looking for.” While Einhorn embraces the human journey of rock stars and his congregants.  The justification for pop culture is because it will bring us to the spiritual levels of the gedolim.</p>
<p>Prior ages focused on Hasidic tales and made them into Romantics, or popularists or Renewal   But Rav Nahman is dead and Besht is dead so one does not have to live with their sectarian nature of Hasidism. But here Rav Eliyashiv is equated with gregarious social marketing and manipulation. He told me a story of Rabbinic friend of his of the same age who found himself by traveling to Wyoming with only $150 and his ID. In order to get back home, his friend had to build resilience and the ability to open up to people by learning to work odd jobs and chat with common people. That is the way to grow and the gedolim stories, told by Einhorn, show that they did similar things.  Extrovert self-help and human potential is the image of the gedolim.</p>
<p>In his opinion, his approach is not <a href="../../../../2010/12/26/cruise-ship-synagogues-for-orthodoxy/index.html">cruise ship Orthodoxy</a> or just entertainment because he sees lives touched. He seeks to actively change people lives as a rabbi, and people do change their lives and their observance and attain a meaningful life.</p>
<p>Yet, the real source of Einhorn’s teachings is the motivational literature, especially Tony Robbin’s <em>Leadership Academy</em> seminar, in which participants learn to <em>&#8220;[c]reate an identity for them self as someone who can help &#8216;anyone&#8217;, no matter what his/her challenge may be.</em> Participants walk barefoot over hot coals by the end of the first evening. The aim of the seminar, demonstrated in the firewalk, is to illustrate that the main quality shared by those who achieve greatness is the ability to take action called personal power.  The physical is ALWAYS rules by thought; nothing can happen on the physical plane until or unless it first happens in the thought plane; The power of focus will get you through even the most seemingly impossible obstacles. For, Robbin’s people pursue an imaginary someday of satisfaction<sup>. </sup>And Einhorn offers the imaginary perfection of the gedolim. People can “transform” by simply declaring a new way of being instead of trying to change themselves in comparison to the past.</p>
<p>He recounted a curious side story when he was bombarded by 1000’s of calls and emails from the Hadar community when he was going to speak at a memorial for Meir Kahane. In general, people don’t protest cross denominational lines. Members of BJ or Anshei Chesed were not the ones to protest WSIS. This belies a sense that they share a common social group even if the two institutions are ideological poles apart.</p>
<p>Einhorn noted that the current major Orthodox educational institutions are not contributing to this quest for meaning and religious experience so students have no need to attend them.</p>
<p>As we ended our discussion, I mentioned that his approach may come under scrutiny in the upcoming years because structurally there is an inherent clash between Talmud Torah to produce gedolim and popular culture. He noted the warning and we parted.</p>

				<p>I was busy traveling for an entire month. I gave many lectures over each extended weekend and then parachuted back into NJ to teach midweek. I met many readers of the blog whom I had never met.  I dont post about traveling before I go as not to let people know when the house is empty. I will have lots of new posts in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>My readership slows to a crawl the two days before Passover but usually jumps to a peak the day after the holiday- the posts will be posted accordingly.</p>

				<p><strong>Judaism and World Religions: Encountering Christianity, Islam, and Eastern Traditions-</strong>&#8211; Alan Brill</p>
<p>Officially published today- March 13, 2012      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judaism-World-Religions-Encountering-Christianity/dp/0230103693/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2" target="_blank">Amazon</a>       <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/judaism-and-world-religions-alan-brill/1025749505?ean=9780230103696&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=alan+brill" target="_blank">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>  (I will have copies for sale at my home or office for $49)</p>
<p>“In this major new contribution, Brill builds upon his earlier path breaking work on Jewish views of other religions. With expertise in both comparative theology and in traditional Jewish texts—a rare combination indeed—he again demonstrates his impressive ability to tackle this vital topic. The work is methodologically sophisticated, as Brill critically engages with key thinkers on interreligious relations. It is also stunningly wide-ranging. He not only delves deeply into Jewish reflections on Christianity and Islam but assembles enlightening but little-known texts on Eastern religions as well. Thanks to Brill’s valuable work, scholars of Judaism and of religion are well-equipped to deal with a topic of great importance in the modern world.” &#8212; <em>Adam Gregerman, Institute for Christian &amp; Jewish Studies, Baltimore, MD</em></p>
<p>“Alan Brill examines the attitudes found in Jewish classical literature and contemporary writings towards western and eastern religions. Brill understands various writers inherently express a wide range of views ranging from rejecting to welcoming. The perspective is designed to argue for a more inclusive and tolerant stance based on modern mind-sets and deeper understandings of Christianity and Islam and even Judaism itself. His wide knowledge of world religions from the perspectives of inside practitioners and outside academic scholars of religion allows him to present original and thought provoking arguments for greater religious recognition of the other.” &#8212; <em>Herbert Basser, Queen’s School of Religion, Queen’s University, Kingston Canada</em></p>
<p><em></em>“In presenting the urgency, the possibility, but also the complexity of a Jewish engagement with other religious traditions, Brill works consistently with concrete texts and particular contexts.  Doing so, he not only speaks appropriately to Jews but challengingly to Christians.  By being uniquely Jewish, Brill’s book is a distinctive contribution to the general discussion on how to make religious sense out of religious diversity.”&#8211; <em>Paul Knitter, Paul Tillich Professor of Theology, World Religions, and Culture, Union Theological Seminary, New York.</em></p>
<p>Alan Brill’s work is an encyclopedic contribution to the literature on religious pluralism. It is at once a guide to the spectrum of Jewish interpretations of other faiths, an insightful analysis of the contemporary interreligious landscape and a sampler of Brill’s own comparative thinking in regard to some major traditions. Through argument and by example, this book encourages a new depth of Jewish engagement in the theological discussion of diversity.&#8211; S. Mark Heim,  Samuel Abbot Professor of Christian Theology, Andover Newton Theological School</p>
<p><em>Judaism and World Religions</em> is essential for a Jewish theological understanding of the various issues in encounters with the other major religions. With passion and clarity, Brill argues that in today’s world of strong religious passions and intolerance, it is necessary to go beyond secular tolerance toward moderate religious positions. Brill outlines strategies for Jews who want to remain true to traditional sources while interacting with the diversity of the world’s religions.</p>
<p>This companion volume to <em>Judaism and Other Religions</em> provides the first extensive collection of traditional and academic Jewish approaches to the religions of the world. In the majority of volume, he presents an excellent survey of the possibilities contained in the texts useful for discussing Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism from a Jewish point for view.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="../../../../2011/12/27/daniel-boyarin-and-orthodoxy-an-interview/index.html">Daniel Boyarin</a> just published a new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Gospels-Daniel-Boyarin/dp/1595584684"><em>The Jewish Gospels: the Story of the Jewish Christ,</em></a> an attempt at a popularization of his thought. Boyarin professor of Talmudic Culture at the University of California, Berkeley is influential on the current generation of scholars and is only now beginning to filter down to the clergy level. Boyarin has written on early Jewish–Christian relations and emphasizes that in the early centuries, there was no clear border between the two faiths. Both groups were figuring out their identity based on and in contrast to the other group. One of his earlier books,<em> A Radical Jew: Paul and the Politics of Identity</em>, was part of the new wave of Pauline scholarship showing that Paul did not reject Judaism but he rather sought to create a universal religion for the gentiles. </p>
<p>In this new book, <em>The Jewish Gospels: the Story of the Jewish Christ</em>, he draws the conclusions of his prior work <em>Border Lines</em> and present them in clear layman’s term. The book was meant to be a popular summery of his ideas. In short, every idea in early Christianity is to be found in the variety of Judiasms of the first century. There were Jewish groups who built their Judaism on Daniel, on Isaiah, and the ideas of Qumran.  The Pseudepigrapha was not just a funky alternative to our midrashic narratives, rather they were people’s lived version of Torah</p>
<p>Boyarin looks at the first and second centuries where you have some Jews focusing on the book of Daniel and expecting a mediator figure as redeemer, some even expecting the mediator to be the suffering servant. There was widespread bi-theism or binitarianism within Judaism where Jews perceived God as an unknown God and a lower logos of God. The ideas of a complex godhead (a God with two or three persons) have their origins in the Judaism of Jesus’ time and before him. Many, perhaps most, Jews were expecting a Redeemer who was an anthropomorphic divine being, known as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Boyarin follows the scholarship on the historic Jesus and rejects the popular view that thinks that the Gospels speak of Jesus as abrogating and setting aside the Torah, Boyarin proposes that the Jesus of Mark defended the Torah, and that Jesus, himself, was portrayed as keeping the Sabbath and the kosher rules. Many hold it was the suffering and dying of Jesus that caused a break with traditional Judaism, Boyarin shows that the idea of a suffering Messiah was not foreign to Judaism even beyond the Jesus movement. Boyarin calls on Jews to stop vilifying Christian ideas about God as simply a collection of “unJewish,” perhaps pagan ideas; Jews should stop seeing Christian ideas as bizarre and see them as paths not taken.</p>
<p>Much of the fluid location of division centers on what Boyarin calls Jewish Binitarianism in which there is a lower entity below God that still bears many of the elements of God or is God’s manifestation on earth. Second Temple literature is replete with forms of bitheism, including the philonic logos and the Ezekiel traditions of an Angel of God in the image of a man appearing on the throne. Even rabbinic liturgical terminology, such as the Alenu hymn, speaks of “The Lord of All” as distinct from the “Creator of Bereshit.” (A compete treatment of the topic of bi-theism <a href="http://www.michaelsheiser.com/TwoPowersInHeaven/Boyarin%20Memra.pdf">by Boyarin- here in pdf.</a>)</p>
<p>For Jews, the two powers are one and a person does not worship one without the other. Most Jews are no longer aware of this bitheism and the rabbinic polemics against considering them two entities. Yet by the time we are done with the book, or actually from the very first pages of the volume, the Trinity is a Jewish concept</p>
<p>Boyarin thinks that many of the theological concepts, which earlier scholarship, such as Rudolf Bultmann, had credited to a Hellenistic break from Judaism are actually antecedent to rabbinic Judaism as part of second Temple Judaism.  Bultmann in the 1920s declared that the wisdom traditions of the logos were not a living force in Judaism. For Boyarin, the logos is ever present as the site of God’s presence in the world in the targumim, in Philo of Alexandria, in Ben Sira, and then later in the midrashim. </p>
<p>This is not at all like the <a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/151028/">ill-informed gibberish of Boteach</a> who lacked any research skilled. Yet, I don’t know how this will play out among ordinary non-academic Jews. Boyarin does not accept Kosher Jesus and thinks that Rabbinic Judaism in its definition rejected it. This rejection of a “second power” by rabbinic Jews, begins a “heresiological” process in Christianity and Judaism. Polemics created the nascent borders, yet it was intellectual “smugglers who transported discourses [. . .] in both directions across the abstract frontier of the two groups.”  In non-technical terms, Boyarin assumes that these positions were slowly rejected in the first centuries though self-definitions and polemics. They were no longer kosher by the end of the process. </p>
<p>In contrast, the academic field won’t accept all of Boyarin’s conclusions; however, they will embrace the book because he pushes the limit on questioning our essentialism and fixed boundaries of the first century.  </p>
