				<p>There is an upcoming conference that will discuss &#8220;Big Tent Christianity.&#8221; In the 1980&#8217;s and 1990&#8217;s everyone loved boxes. People fit themselves into boxes and they fit others into boxes. Now there is a feeling of lots of lines crossed and that there can be a big tent religion again like in the1950&#8217;s. Lines between denominations are more fluid. In addition, mystic and rationalist, social activist, and those who want a return to the medieval or are more vision centered than denominational now feel they dont like the institutional boundaries. If there was a Conference on &#8220;Big Tent Judaism,&#8221;   would people come? probably </p>
<p>Who would speak? Not those who are branded by a specific slice of the pie. Who is cross denominational? The Left side of Orthodoxy is clearly labeled as narrow and denominational. Who are the boundary crossers? How many are Rabbis? How many Academics? How many psychologists or journalists?</p>
<p>Limmud -NY attracts pluralists of all denominations &#8211; How would a big tent conference be different? Is there interest in creating a big tent and taking down walls? Or will Jews be against it and will only do it 4-5 years after the Evangelicals, Catholics, and Mainliners change? So is this the jewish trend for a decade from now?</p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently, the next big thing on the agenda for some in the movement is a conference that will be held in Raleigh, NC on September 8-9, 2010, called “Big Tent Christianity.”<br />
    There’s a new ethos emerging. It’s a Christian identity that hasn’t fully discovered itself yet, but knows it doesn’t fit in a lot of the standard categories…<br />
 …What happens if you’re a fundamentalist who starts asking questions, or an Evangelical who is tired of having to defend yourself from a fractious right flank, or a mainliner who dreams of a faith that is more mission-driven than institution-bound, or a Catholic who has more affinity with St. Francis and Mother Teresa than Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly, or an Eastern Orthodox who wants to share their ancient treasures and receive gifts from other newer traditions too?</p>
<p>    I think some folks – not all, of course – who know they don’t fit in with these established spaces are seeking a more expansive and open space – to think and dream together, pray and worship together, serve and reach out together. The “big tent” image works beautifully for this because it evokes both the American revivalist phenomenon of the Pentecostal tent meeting and the more “liberal” sense of hospitality and welcome.<br />
Is Emerging moving toward a “new ecumenical movement”? Is that the next step? And how “Big” is this “Big Tent”?<br />
<a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/where-is-emerging-now-and-where-is-it-goin">full version here </a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the same entry- there is a question- What is happening to the emergent Christians who broke from the Evangelicals? Answer- some are becoming liberal, others are returning to their Orthodox base, and some are actually still trying for new expansive visions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some emerging Christians will become mainline liberals (or progressives as many prefer to be called now), some will retreat a bit by assuming their old seats in evangelical churches, and others will continue to impact the evangelical movement in a missional or expansive, robust gospel direction.”</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Next month is the scheduled release date Rodger Kamenetz’s<em> Burnt Books,</em> his Nextbook work comparing Kafka and Nachman of Bratzlav. The book, as all other volumes in the Nextbook series, will be reviewed by every Jewish publication.  </p>
<p>However, the innovative work on Rabbi Nachman that everyone should be reading and reviewing is Zvi Mark, <em>Mysticism and Madness, The Religious Thought of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav</em> which was translated last summer and attracted no reviews from editors. </p>
<p>Zvi Mark in <em>Mysticsm and Madness</em> shows that the Existential approach to Rabbi Nachman is incorrect. Rav Nachman is not a forerunner of existential doubt or living with the paradox of an absent God, rather he is literally stark raving mad in order to cast off his intellect to reach God.</p>
<p>Almost a century ago, the journalist Hillel Zeitlin went from atheistic Schopenhauer follower to Neo-hasidic theologian advocating the creation of an elite group of those who truly understood religion seeking religious experience, prophecy, and mysticism.  For Zeitlin, neither the rationalism of secular materialism nor the vitalism of Nietzsche pointed to God, rather the madness, stories, and songs of Rav nachman offered a means of reaching God.</p>
<p>Joseph Weiss, Scholem’s student, presented Rav Nachman  as living in paradox of the absence of God. The secret of Kabbalah is that the process is an illusion and that we don’t know if God really exists, so we cannot tell the common folk who could not bear the truth.  Neither could Weiss, who committed suicide to escape the painful paradoxes of life. </p>
<p>Arthur Green continued the approach of Weiss and presented Rabbi Nachman as a non mystical approach based on expressing one’s existential needs in I-Thou dialogue with God, and the need to face the modern Enlightened challenges to faith by an Existential leap of faith. And in<br />
Green’s brilliant excursive on faith and doubt in Rabbi Nachman, Green shows that the deep secret of creation is that there is ordinary heresy and a deeper heresy from God himself, implying that the secret of Kabbalah may be that God does not exist. Green further develops this absent God from one of Rav Nachman’s stories where the portrait of the King in the story is both found in a reflection in a mirror (implying to Green that it is our own projection) and that the King shrinks away (implying that there is no KIng). Green’s work has been translated in several languages and is taken as the actually meaning of Rabbi Nahman in academic circles and literary readers like Rodger Kamenetz. </p>
<p>Zvi Mark comes along and says No! No! No! Rabbi Nahman is not an existential, he is not waking close to heresy, and he is not suffering the paradoxes of modern life. Rabbi Nachman is a mystic. In Zvi Mark’s presentation, Rabbi Nachman is not fascinated by the Enlightenment and its heresies.</p>
<p>Rabbi Nachman thinks that the intellect can never reach God. A Litvak, a Maimonidean, or a Maskil are all the same in that they each, God forfend, use their intellect and the only way to God is by the imagination. One can only know God through song, story, and prayer. One must entirely cast off the intellect to be religious. Madness is a paradigmatic life of casting off the intellect. One can also use crying, joking, dancing, play or hand-clapping.   </p>
<p>The goal of Rabbi Nachman is the creation of mystical consciousness. Mark states that previous studies “neglected the mystical goal at the center of his thought.” Imagination is needed for belief and mysticism, and prophecy. Revelation is not just without intellect but from the removal of intellect Therefore deeds of madness and casting away the intellect is good. There are many levels of mystical experience – highest is the stripping away everything including speech and belief. </p>
<p>In order to shorten the Hebrew edition for the English version, the discussions on the role of blood, humors, bile and biology were removed, these situated Rabbi Nachman in Early Modern views of knowledge, the soul and pnuma. (For me, some of this material were the best parts.)<br />
When Rabbi Nachman says that “Every blame of grass has a song” to him it is a magical power known to shamans and baalei Shem. Rabbi Nachman removes our need to resort to sorcery to manipulate nature since we can use prayer and song. Following Moshe  Idel,  Reb Nachman is credited with an approach that treats Renaissance music as magical. So too, medicine and doctors work by magical and astrological influence, so Rabbi Nachman offers songs and prayers instead. </p>
<p>Hitboddedut, speaking at length with God is only the first stage of Rabbi Nachman’s full theory of  hitboddedut , the higher stage and higher goal  is the annihilation of self awareness into a mystical oneness. Joseph  Weiss &amp; Arthur Green treat hitboddedut as an i-thou relationship. Green states that an “inner openness and of a person’s speech with his maker are in a certain aspect all that is truly important.”</p>
<p>For Marks, Rabbi Nachman’s goal was cleaving to the light of the Infinite One. The goal is a unification with God but that unification was difficult even for Moses who could not completely overcome his intellect.  Rabbi Nachman’s mysticism is not  love or erotic. It is casting off of intellect.<br />
For example, when Rabbi Nachman was in Istanbul on the way to the land of Israel, he performed foolish and childish acts in the marketplace.  Regressive play is a means of casting off the intellect. It is a liminal return to a border of adult existence where one does not even know how to hold a book.  </p>
<p>There is a famous maamar of Rav Nachman called “Bo el pharaoh” where Rabbi Nachman discusses the void of creation.  Arthur Green  explains it as the end of our seeking reveals a paradox at end, that the  whole process is illusory and we have a doubt about God existence at the core of faith.  Zvi Mark states that Green neglected the parts of the passage where Rabbi Nachman writes that the heresy is raised by song. And song as a form of casting off the intellect can solve problem and lead to a union with the Divine. Mark notes that in this case, Zeitlin was more correct than later scholars in that he understood the role of song as mysticism in the passage. For Green,  –we cannot know if there is a God.To reach the highest level we ask God  to have our faith shaken. For Mark, not knowing is not a lack of  knowledge of God but the wondrous nature of God, a mystical union from casting off the intellect.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../../../2010/08/21/zvi-mark-%E2%80%93-the-religious-thought-of-rabbi-nachman-of-breslov-part-2-of-3/index.html">Continue reading part II here in which I give links to some of the reviews in the Hebrew Press</a></strong></p>
<p>Zvi Mark also edited, deciphered and published Rabbi Nachman’s lost book of secrets as well as working to recover the content of the lost teachings. I will deal with some this in later posts.</p>
<p><strong>Update from Rodger Kamenetz </strong><br />
In <strong>Burnt Books,</strong> I view Kafka not as an existentialist but as Scholem did, a possible kabbalist. That is my investigation. And also, just as Alan Brill asks, I too ask, what is the role of imagination in mysticism, how fundamental is imagination and more particularly literary imagination to the Jewish mystical experience?<br />
Very I would say. That is my book.</p>
<p>I am glad to see here a review of Zvi Marks&#8217; very important study. It came to my hands as I was just finishing<br />
Burnt Books but I was eager to learn from it and include some of his comments on Rabbi Nachman&#8217;s mystical<br />
practice of &#8220;smallness.&#8221; It is a book that any serious student of Rabbi Nachman&#8217;s work will want to read.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>This past Shabbat I was visiting a resort community as the guest of the associate rabbi. The special Friday night guest speaker at dinner was Rabbi Daniel Cohen of Congregation Agudath Sholom of Stamford . The rabbi got up to speak and in an informal style opened his talk by seeking to  elicit responses from the assembled. One example: He would say the word Phoenix and then point his hand at the audience to get them to shout out Arizona.  </p>
<p>When he did start speaking, after about 5 minutes I turned to the associate rabbi and whispered that this talk is straight word for word -Rick Warren, A Purpose Driven Life.   I received a nod of agreement and for the next fifteen minutes heard a 1980-1990’s evangelical talk about God wants you to make the most of every moment and listen to the decisive moments in one’s life.   When the rabbi was discussing how we have a million truths revealed in our hearts every day and we need resolve to follow them then I knew we were in the heartland of America. He also stressed the importance of peak moments and self actualization as well as the need to decisively commit oneself to Judaism.</p>
<p>Rabbi Cohen also announced that this week he would start his website – &#8220;Forty days to a better you.&#8221;  At that point there was no uncertainty as to his teachings since Rick Warren’s book opens by saying it will take the reader on a 40 day spiritual journey and is divided accordingly. This method of leadership  divides teachings into 40 days of purpose, 40 days of spiritual growth, 40 days of love. </p>
<p>What stuck in my mind from the talk was that Jews and Jewish texts don’t use the word &#8220;truth&#8221; for the moments of everyday life and feelings of the heart. That language is from the Second Great revival and the need to find grace and God acting in in one’s life.  But whereas the early 19th century Evangelical text sought a single conversion moment, now in the Fourth Great Revival the religious person seeks God every day in their suburban family decisions..</p>
<p>So I walked over to Rabbi Cohen after dessert and asked: Who else he reads besides Rick Warren? He answered immediately Abraham Maslow on peak experiences, John Maxwell on leadership in Evangelical Churches, Eckhart Tolle on living in the moment and the Harvard Business School studies of Evangelical leadership.</p>
<p>The next day, Rabbi Cohen sought to continue the conversation. To be fair, I told him that I study phenomena like contemporary spirituality and that he is object of study in this conversation.</p>
<p>I asked him when he first got interested in the writings of the Evangelicals? After a cautious pause he answered that since his father was rabbi in the Atlanta Ga., one day when he was around ten years old he heard  Robert H Schuller, the famous senior televangelist on the radio who preaches his <em>Hour of Power</em> show from his Crystal Cathedral and was hooked.Rabbi Cohen narrated how this interest continued for decades and that he sought out meetings with Evangelical leaders when he had a pulpit in Denver. </p>
<p>Rabbi Cohen described how he presents the material as learning wisdom from the gentiles and gathering sparks of Torah. It is no different to him than any other management or leadership training. Rabbi Cohen lead a session for rabbis at the RCA convention two years ago on “The Purpose Driven Synagogue- the need for Purpose Driven Leadership.” He gives sermons, available as podcasts, on American Evangelical  topics like “The Road Less Traveled (C Scott Peck) or “Love is the Answer.” (Gerald Jampolsky- 1980&#8217;s newage)</p>
<p>This form of evangelical finding peak moments in the everyday grew alongside Centrist Orthodoxy for the last few decades so it is a natural fit. When asked if he interested in  the recent changes to the Evangelical world over the last decade like-social action, stewardship, concern for the world, openness to the underprivileged- he answered not as much and only to help people be more in touch with their life mission and purpose. He is not interested in the Emergent post-Evangelical Church nor the widespread use of Pentecostal materials found in kiruv organizations. Rather, we now have an orthodoxy which expresses its modernity in the narratives of everyday life, our human relationship, how we budget our time, and how we narrate our suburban lives. </p>
<p>Is Rabbi Cohen late to the game of 1980’s Evangelical works? Not really. The groundwork was already laid by rabbis who were teaching a halakhah that reflected these values. Compare this late entrance to Maurice Lamm, explaining Orthodoxy in his late 1960’s books as popular psych which was twenty years after the post WWII  popular psychology of Joshua Liebrman’s <em>Piece of Mind.</em></p>
<p>Notice also how far this approach of love and decisive moments is from submission to a system. We look into our hearts for love.  Rabbi Ethan Tucker wants to reopen the intellectual questions of high modernity and explain the texts of the Talmud in a new light. This Evangelical approach does not need to let any texts or laws interfere. The crucial religious acts personal and family oriented. One does not fight about changes in synagogue life since religion is situated in one&#8217;s heart and decisions about life&#8217;s course.</p>
<p>This interest runs in the family since Rabbi Daniel Cohen’s brother Benjamin Cohen wrote <em>My Jesus Year A Rabbi&#8217;s Son Wanders the Bible Belt in Search of His Own Faith.</em></p>
<p>Postscript: As I prepare to post this to the blog, I received an email from another shul stating as its Elul teshuvah  announcement “Re-energize your Relationship with God,” a phrase owing more to Evangelical language than to Maimonides or the Chai Adom. </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Time to actually start reading the new work of Rav Kook.-<a href="../../../../2010/05/28/new-unpublished-rav-kook/index.html"> for details on the new work, see here</a>.  This is a first draft and it will go through many revisions to translation and explanation in the upcoming days. <strong>Help me think through the implications of chapter eight.</strong></p>
<p>Rabbi  Kook in his recently published work <em>LeNevuchei HaZeman</em> seeks to answers the philosophic question of his era, specifically the problems created by his reading of the Hebrew summaries of the thought of Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and Hegel.  His Hebrew is forced to find words to express the ideas of German idealism and many of his transliterations and linguistic coinages are no longer used.</p>
<p>In dealing with the thought of the Hegel,  Kook is forced to deal with the status of other religions. For Hegel, Christianity is the world historical religion and other religions like Roman religion or Judaism have already passed their time to contribute to the civilization of the world. Hegel also assumes that Christianity is best for mediating of the finite and the infinite, the past and the future, and the ethical in society.  Rav Kook solves the problem for his reader in the simple apologetic manner by stating that Judaism is the world historic religion and is best for mediating the logic of the unfolding of the Divine idea.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kook, however, is most innovative in creating a positive role for the other monotheistic faiths. He states in unequivocal terms that God cares about the people of the world and Christianity and Islam are needed to bring perfection to the world.  Centuries before Maimonides had offered an inclusive model in which God in His inscrutable designs which we cannot understand used the other religions to bring knowledge of God to the world. Here the plan is not inscrutable but makes perfect sense since every nation needs its God as part of God’s concern for humanity.</p>
<p>In chapter eight of the new book, we have a desire to offer an understanding (verstehen) of the phenomena of religion. The value of religion is to be judged based on  the rise of consciousness, which Rav Kook identifies with prophecy.  He deems prophecy the peak of the sciences and the path to human perfection. He also accepts Hegel’s glorification of death as the transcending of the self, in Rav Kook’s language as part of attaining the world-to-come. “Eternal life also is dependent on the perfection of man in the powers of body and mind.” The goal of society is to transcend Enlightenment brotherhood and reach a restoration of the unity of infinite and finite, man and animal as portrayed in the Biblical story of the garden of Eden.</p>
<blockquote><p> It is fit to elucidate an understanding of religion in general. </p>
<p>Which religion is identified as Divine, in which there is a complete obligation to all those who follow it as part of the nation(s) whose ancestors accepted that religion to practice and keep it? And which [religion] is it possible to pronounce upon it  an value of error  to the point  where it is impossible to obligate anyone of pure knowledge to maintain it .</p>
<p>The principle of prophecy is the most complete science in its clarification and necessity that is possible in the necessity of history.<br />
As long as humanity still needs guidance, as long as the world is not filled with knowledge until every individual finds complete clarification the entirety of consciousness  from his own self-understanding. Then he is elevated from the universal faith to clarified unified knowledge…. As long as death still rules a person to embitter his life and to steal his tranquility….However, an era will surely come of the perfection of man in which it wont be sufficient that every person will recognize all humanity all brothers and friend. But will also recognize the sublime consciousness of which the Torah describes at the start of the creation of man.  (29)</p>
<p>The matter is understood that the obligation of religion is from a special reception and warrant from prophecy, which passed from Moses. Today, we are no longer able to attain this form of consciousness except by means of an inner desire and self-consciousness in love. Even then, [the prophecy or religion]  is uncertain if consciousness can  find a place for  mizvot to use them for a sublime purpose or not. </p></blockquote>
<p>Rav Kook&#8217;s use of prophecy as a translation of self-consciousness  does indeed allow one to create a Hegelian Judaism. Most Jewish Hegelians were into the History and here we have an interest in the Phenomenology.  Kook’s understanding of consciousness as prophecy would has the potential to mediate mediate and modern thought. If followed it would have been similar to the Islamic scholars Corbin or Nasr who do not relinquish prophecy.  Rav Kook holds that in the world to come after the  resurrection of dead-then everyone will be a prophet. Yet he questions the role of Mizvot at that time.  At this point, his position seems closer the position <a href="../../../../2010/02/13/aleksandrov-rav-kook-buddhism-and-gentile-religion/index.html">which he rejects in his letter to Alexandrov</a>. The weak point in his theory is that rather than giving us a phenomenology of prophecy, he says that we lost most of the details and criteria.  It is kinda hard claiming prophecy as the epitome of the sciences if one does not give the details. </p>
<p>To return to his original question, he answers that any religion that helps in the evolution of humanity is needed and one should respect them. Since he already acknowledged that they can have prophecy, he extends his thought and states that other religions can even have sensory wonders and signs  based on Divine influence in order to lead humanity forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider, the religion which gives the possibility to arrange the sublime evolution of mankind to be absolute truth. But with every religion that serves idolatry – there is no certain hope to arrive at this level.  Behold only the knowledge of unity of God can perfect humanity to congregate in a single spiritual center to create a representational central place, a place of peace and love. But in the mistake of idolatry this hope of perfection is lost. [This hope is] only in the Torah of Israel and the Torah that draws from it.  29-30</p>
<p>Consider, that the religions that draw from their own, it is not fit to looking upon them in an ungenerous manner.  It is possible to be that from their foundations a divine influx is given in order that they should be engaged in incorporating a significant part of humanity in what is fitting to them. From this perspective of purpose it is possible that certain matters of sensory wonders if needed to strengthen them since the matter concerns all of humanity because God’s hand is outstretched from the beginning  of creation until  its end.  However, the side of error mixed into them is nothing except what is impossible to be grounded in them  as their principle nature of their guidance to the final perfection to find a single spirituality in the world.</p>
<p>The matter is understood that except for Israel there is no nation in the world that has absolute merit over another from the perspective of spiritual acquisitions of ethics and Divine religion.<br />
The opinions rooted in the books of Christians and Muslims that state that the value of Israel is transcended, forefend, needs to be nullified in order for humanity to arrive at its rationale and eternal  purpose.<br />
But the status of the inner ethic there is in every religion to enlighten and to benefit it is fitting to respect… they are engaged in the worship of God according to their arrangement.</p></blockquote>
<p>He grants Christians and Muslims an independent status. Whereas Franz Rosenzweig starting from the same Hegelian premises gave the task of perfection of the world and space to Christians and left Jews in the eternal unity, Rav Kook sees everyone working toward the perfection of humanity. Until the eschaton, the other religions play a role in the divine plan for the world. And in his reading of the Jewish sources defective forms of Biblical monotheism or prophecy are still valuable as base for those religions. Their understanding of the principles of religion are sufficient for  them even if we differ in the details. The Trinity is not a false god but the God of Israel “Even if they mix in imagination” or “weaker understanding.’ </p>
<p>Every nation has its own religion, and weakening a nations religion weakens the state. We should support those that are organized based on their national history and national concepts. Conversion weakens a nation but shows the inner striving of people to find the best inner moral qualities. Other religions are only good for those born into them since because the concepts are rotted in the soul, But they are not for Jews whose souls  contain pure ideas of God.</p>
<p>In chapter thirty, he returns to some of these them and states that religions are not to be judged on the practical details, rather on their power for the future, their ability to aid in the evolution of mankind. </p>
<p>In chapter fifty two, he states that our concept of tolerance is based on the need for everything playing a part in perfection. Therefore, a gentile that learns Torah, in the sense of the idea of God, is like a high priest.  Rav Kook connects this idea to prophecy and revelation and says that Torah from Heaven is the pillar of religious freedom and freedom of the spirit because true faith transcends any one finite category. Finally, he gives us a few cryptic lines that he thinks disproves the radicals among the Biblical critics because it is a historic fact that the knowledge of God destroyed the ancient idolatry. And this activity of negating idolatry and bringing knowledge of God was “mit-ha-beret im sefer Torah.”</p>
<p>What is he refuting, considering the Bible as primitive? What does “mit-ha-beret im sefer Torah.” mean?<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Rabbi Avi Weiss just made the news for letting women lead Kabbalat Shabbat, however there was a precedent 23 years ago. Back in 1987, I was studying in Israel. One morning, I received a phone call from friends in Washington Heights asking for the phone number of Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits. They had organized what they termed a halakhic havurah, in which about 30 people participated. and wanted a pesak for women to lead Kabbalat Shabbat.  Here is a first draft based on assembling  the story via email.</p>
<p>In the late 1980’s there was Halakhic Havurah consisting of RIETS students, Female Revel students , YU graduates and other who attended for social reasons that lived in the heights. The leadership consisted of [Rabbi] Danny Lehmann, Larry Yudelson., Shoshana Jebwab and Michal Lieberman. The Hazanot were Michal Lieberman and Lisa Soleymani.</p>
<p>One of the founders formulated the motivation as a way &#8220;to push the boundaries, find allies and support, and learn about social action and power sharing. It allowed us to expose the socially conservative attitudes of our teachers, who more or less told us it was permitted but they weren&#8217;t going to allow it anyway. We were feminists who were troubled that halakhic obedience meant we were beholden to social and ethical mores of Babylon&#8217;s early Middle Ages.&#8221; </p>
<p>The group chose to have a woman lead Kabbalat Shabbat in a nonshul setting (an apartment in Washington Heights) because as far as they understood there was no actual halakhic problem with a woman leading Kabbalat Shabbat  in a mixed group, especially  if it was not a regular shul. They reasoned that there was no need of a minyan for Kabbalat Shabbat  nor even a need to actually recite Kabblat Shabbat since it was only a sixteenth century custom</p>
<p>The group called Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits z”l who had recently published his works calling for halakhic flexibility and sensitivity to women’s issues. Rabbi Berkovits said it&#8217;s legamrei mutar (completely permitted), no question. He quoted a halakhic authority who ruled that all issues of modesty and community honor follow the local sensibility. He cited how the Jews of Yemen wrote to Rambam saying that in their lands people wear shorts. Are the Jews allowed to wear shorts to the bima? Rambam answered in the affirmative. Rabbi Berkovits sent the group a  teshuvah as a handwritten letter.</p>
<p>They also called Rabbi Yossi Adler of Congregation Rinat Yisrael in Teaneck who also said it was mutar and that he allowed the group  to publicize the psak in his name. It is important to note that Adler was still willing to give this leniency even after Rabbi Hershel Schachter had pillaged and insulted  Rabbi Adler in Hadarom for supporting women’s prayer groups. The assumption in 1987 for many was that the liberal forces among Rav Soloveitchik students would naturally triumph despite the critiques of woman&#8217;s prayer groups in 1983. </p>
<p>In addition, they called Rabbi Joel Wolowelsky of Yeshivah HS of Flatbush who was an advocate for women saying kaddish. Surprisingly, Wolowelsky said that it should not be done. His argument was that although kabbalat shabbat is not formally part of the service in a full halachic sense, we have been treating it as such for 400 years, so if women  can&#8217;t lead maariv, we should not allow them to lead kabbalat shabbat either. Alternate rememberance, he said that a woman leading the kabbalat Shabbat  in a mixed group is technically permissible but is not public policy. He was an advocate for the preservation of the status quo. </p>
<p>There was some push back from two of the RIETS students concerning kol issah, allowing a woman to publically sing. Therefore they had two women recite Kabbalat Shabbat at the same time. Nevertheless, one of the two left the group anyway. (As an ironic touch, years later he left the Orthodox community.) </p>
<p>According to one of the two women hazanot: “Leading with another person was very disappointing for me &#8211; we had to coordinate to sing everything together, so there was none of the spontaneity that one has leading Tefillah alone. When I lead tefillah at our Women&#8217;s Tefillah Group I can change my mind about a tune at the last minute, or add something, which i enjoy much more.”</p>
<p>The early 1980’s was a time of a direction not chosen. There was widespread women’s prayer groups, Rabbis Yitz Greenberg and Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits were invited speakers at RCA conventions, and Rabbi Stevie Riskin was still in NYC. This group, the first group of gen-xe’rs wanted to push the envelope further. They expected the liberal positions to carry gen-x. However, by this point in 1987 Rabbi Yitz Greenberg was no longer an acceptable speaker on campus. This halakhic havurah was trying to push back, but that was not to be. </p>
<p>Shoshana Jedwab states that &#8220;In retrospect, I feel it was more experimental than a serious attempt to found a havurah that would last from year to year.&#8221; Eventually everyone in the group moved on, married, moved away, and started careers. Some of the participants are no longer Orthodox, others remain on liberal side of their communities, and  a few slouched into an acceptance of Centrism. But this should be remembered as the start of women leading Kabbalat Shabbat in YU Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Note- This post will likely change when I receive more information and corrections from the participants.</p>

				<p>Who is the Stranger today?<br />
This weeks&#8217; dvar Torah from Uri l&#8217;Tzedek offers us a return to the universalism of Hermann Cohen. Paam, once upon a time Herman Cnohen was an accepted part of a Rabbinic education, Mosad Harav Kook kashered him up and translated him, Akiva Simon and Harold Fisch debated which verses to use for Jewish universalism and Rav Soloveitchik did his degree on him. (And we get chief rabbis Sacks quoting him without citation.)</p>
<p><a href="http:///www.uic.edu/depts/phil/bios/fleischacker.htm">Samuel Fleischacker a professor at the University of Illinois</a> offers us an expanded definition that seeks to overcome ethnocentrism.  Hermann Cohen taught that we should judge a person&#8217;s ethics by how we relate to the economically and socially downtrodden. It is easy to pride ourselves on our ethic of helping our own community and building one&#8217;s own enclave. But what of those not part of the community, especially those who work for us or we live among?</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.utzedek.org/socialjusticetorah/parsha-divrei-torah/357-parshat-eikev-by-sam-fleischacker.html">Parshat Eikev by Samuel Fleischacker</a></p>
<p>This week we are commanded to love the “stranger.” (10:19)  Who is this stranger?  Halakha tells us that it is the convert.  This is disappointing, if we are looking in the Torah for signs of concern for humanity in general, and it seems a clear stretch of the verse.  For what 10:19 tells us, more precisely, is to love the stranger “because you were strangers in Egypt.”  This echoes two verses in Mishpatim (Ex 22:20 and 23:9), which warn us against oppressing the stranger and note that we “know the soul of the stranger” from our experience in Egypt.  We were, however, certainly not converts in Egypt.  Rather, in knowing the soul of the stranger from our experience in Egypt, we know a generally human kind of suffering.  P’shat in these verses would seem to demand that we not oppress non-Jews, should we ever rule over them as the Egyptians did over us.</p>
<p>And that supreme Being presumably cares about all sorts of strangers, not just converts to Judaism.  Verses 18-19 indicate that we are to emulate this sort of love, to care about all humanity as God does.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen suggested that it is only in loving the stranger that we fully express our monotheism.  We understand God as truly the ruler of the entire universe, creator and guardian of all humankind, only when we recognize Him as the God of the stranger and not just of our kin.  Loving the stranger is the most difficult of loves, the greatest challenge to our inclination to limit our concerns to the people and social system we know.  But to care just about what we know is to worship ourselves, and to limit God to a being who takes care of the Jews is idolatry.  True monotheism, a true recognition of God as source of or ruler over the entire universe, requires us to see God in the unfamiliar, the alien, as well as the familiar — in the complete outsider and not just in our neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>In practice this means, for Jews in Israel, seeing God in the Palestinians, and for Jews here in America, seeing God in the Latina/os and other immigrants who work in our restaurants and stores and homes.<br />
The God of gods&#8230; stands with all these people against their oppressors just as He stood with us in Egypt, cares for them as He does for us, and is ready to deliver them, as he does col adam, from one who is stronger than them, even when that stronger person is a Jew.<br />
We were not delivered from Egypt to set up another ethnocentric system that oppresses outsiders. </strong> We were delivered, instead, precisely to spread the message that the true God cares for all humanity (that is how we become a “holy nation”).  <strong>And that requires that we understand “love the stranger” broadly and richly:   not just in legal terms but in the expansive terms that allow us to mirror God’s own love, and help bring about God’s own justice.<br />
