				<p>This was forwarded to me. Doing PR work for Israel&#8217;s poor attempts at hasbara is now formally defined as kiruv. What isn&#8217;t kiruv at this point? On the other hand, now kiruv can be separated from mizvot and be applied to AIPAC or ZOA work. Thoughts?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Ezriel Guenzig (1868-1931) was a Orthodox rabbi in Moravia and later, he became the head of the Mizrahi Tahkemoni School in Antwerp. In his time, as editor of the journal Ha-Eshkol, he was a conduit of Western and academic knowledge to his Hebrew reading rabbinic audience; unfortunately, he is remembered little today. Besides Hinduism, Guenzig wrote on Abulafia and other interesting topics. It seems he was influenced and even wrote a book about <a href="http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Mieses_Fabius">Fabius Mieses,</a> the source for Rav Kook&#8217;s knowledge of modern philosophy. And his journal <em>Ha-Eshkol</em> is available as a <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=book-uLAXAQAAIAAJ&amp;feature=more_from_author">free android app.</a> </p>
<p>In 1900, he wrote an appreciation of the recently published works belonging to the series <em>Sacred Books of the East</em> edited under the direction of Max Muller.  He compares the Hindu positively to Judaism, noting the similarities of the two religious worldviews Kabbalah and Hinduism, especially emanation, nirvana, eyn sof, sefirot, and theories of the soul. Guenzig’s approach consists of focusing on the Vendata philosophic works and the ancient Hindu scripture to formulate a Hindu monotheism, which he then connects to his own Perennialism. Mentions of Indian thought in Rabbinic thought in the first part of the 20th century proceed in a similar manner. Note his labeling monotheism as the &#8220;moral foundation&#8221; for humanity gained through cultural evolution.</p>
<blockquote><p>In perusing these works we find many concepts and images, mores and customs, principles and many doctrines that also stand in the highs of our religion.  We see astounding similarities in many ways between the faith of the Hindus and the faith of Israel, not just in details but even in the principles of purpose, their studies, and their opinions…Just as the Therapeutae in Egypt brought Neo-Platonism into Judaism, the Essenes in Judea brought the secrets of Buddhism- the masters of secrets in India- to the masters of secrets in Alexandria and other Jewish works who, in turn, brought these allusions in the secret of our holy writings.</p>
<p>The belief in the Oneness of the creator and the unity of existence is a sublime step in the cultural evolution of humanity, the moral foundation for all religions of Enlightened peoples. </p>
<p>Also the [Hindu] doctrine of the relationship of the individual soul to the universal soul and the spiritual perfection by cleaving to divinity, freed from all desire and physical lusts… is found in many Jewish believers and also is found by our ancient wise and the early kabbalists who followed them.  </p>
<p>If a scholar delves into the Vedas will see that the early kabbalists, the fathers of the philosophic Kabbalah most of them followed the Hindus… </p></blockquote>
<p>Ezriel Gruenzig, “Hindu Philosophy and Kabbalah” [Hebrew] <em>Ha-Eshkol</em> 3  (Cracow: 1900)  40-48.</p>

<p>A forthcoming Islamic reality television show in Malaysia aims to find the best women preachers and change conservative mindsets on the role of women in Muslim societies. The 13-episode prime time program titled “Solehah,” an Arabic word meaning “pious female,” is a talent contest that will feature charismatic young Muslim women judged by clerics on their religious knowledge as well as their oratory skills and personality.</p>
<p>Although Islam allows both men and women to preach the religion to society, the field remains dominated by males in most Muslim countries, something the show’s producers in this mainly Muslim but multi-religious Southeast Asian country hope to change.</p>
<p><em>“If American Idol can help their contestants develop as singers, our show aims to help Muslim women develop as Islamic preachers,”</em> said Zulkarnaen Mokhtar, brand manager at the private television station which produces the show. It will start airing in October and follows on the heels of the hit Islamic themed show “Imam Muda,” or Young Imam, which is shown on a rival TV station and seeks the best Imam or male Muslim leader. Imam Muda is set to enter its second season.</p>

				<p>Continues from <a href="../../../../2011/06/09/david-hartman-part-i/index.html">Part I here</a> and <a href="../../../../2011/06/14/david-hartman-2-%E2%80%93-landes-on-hartman-and-the-mutual-responses/index.html">from Part II here.</a></p>
<p>Here is another post about the 1985 book <em>A Living Covenant.</em> I assume that I will receive the interview with Charlie Buckholtz soon, then and only then will I address the new book directly.<br />
In the very friendly review of Hartman by David Ellenson of HUC in <em>Modern Judaism</em>, we learn that Ellenson finds Hartman as exemplar of what Orthodoxy, nay the entire modern rabbinate should be. And then Ellenson gives a few broad critiques. Why does Hartman base himself on Talmud and Rabbinics and not the Bible? What would compel the modern Jew to follow Hartman’s Talmudism? Important questions for the ex-Orthodox Ellenson who continuously looks to Orthodox Teshuvot for guidance.</p>
<p>This review by Neil Gilman of JTS. offers a strong contrast to the review of Landes and Elleenson.</p>
<p>Gilman pegs Hartman as a follower of the approach of Jacob Katz in which sociology changes halakhah. In that for Jacob Katz  there is an “interpretive power of the community to interpret halakhah- based on what the community will accept. God’s Torah can be interpreted in a liberal way if the community accept it. [AB- but it is important to note that Hartman himself makes his argument from ethics, not from historical change.]<br />
(Back in the 1960’s the Jewish Observer considered the use of Jacob Katz enough to make one Conservative, by the 1980’s there came to be a YU interpretative of Katz without the historic change or historicism.) </p>
<p>But Gilman asks is that enough or even justified. For Gilman there is a human role in the writings of the Torah. The Bible and the entire creation of Talmud as human documents. When Gilman quotes Hartman as saying that the debate over tanur shel achnui shows the potential of God’s word, Gilman adds [SIC] after Hartman&#8217;s mention of &#8220;God’s word&#8221; to demonstrative to his reader that &#8211; of course it is not God’s word. How could Hartman be so foolish to belief that?</p>
<p>For Gilman, to interpret means that it is a human product. He does not understand how for Hartman and Berkovits to reinterpret is a power of the Divine halakhah itself. For Gilman innovation means a human change from the past, not a continuation of the tradtional idea of chiddush  (AB &#8211;catch that Hartman’s belief in Chiddush is not Maimonides and closer to what we consider Nahmanidean- <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/Gruss/halbert.html#anchor145856">see Halbertal on the topic of the continuous growth of halakhah</a>.)</p>
<p>In this review, we see that the Orthodoxy of Berkovits and Hartman argues for ethical consciences: and pragmatics in the law. The Conservative approach of Gilman needs the Torah to be a human text, he needs a rejection of traditional theology, and historical/sociological argument.<br />
On the question of Hartman’s relationship to Rav Soloveitchik in his writings. Landes – did not see any break. Depending on the topic, Hartman was closer to the Rav thought then was Landes. However, Gilman sees a break. I already have read the new 2011 book and in that one there is clearly a break. </p>
<p>When I first read the book in 85, then I just did not recognize the Rav Soloveitchik that I knew in the pages of Hartman’s <em>Living Covenant</em> Even though the Rav’s influence came out in Hartman’s public talks, I did not see it int he book. In the 1980’s Hartman would talk about how much therapy time he spend working through his relationship with Rav Soloveitchik, how he had an Oedipal relationship with the Rav. But at the time, I felt that Hartman’s presentation of Rav Soloveitchik’s creativity vs submission is not the same as the Rav’s own majesty and humility.I chalked it up to my youth and to maybe the 30 year difference in the Rav. And in those years, people were much more troubled by revisionism from the right since, at the time, it seemed a complete distortion.</p>
<p>Gilman review- he does not think that Hartman has a liberal enough theory of revelation, talks too much about God’s Torah, he wont win against rising Fundamentalism. But he likes his Zionist theology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Alternatively, he could adopt a view of revelation that denies literal-ism in favor of acknowledging a more substantive human role in shaping the contents of Torah </p>
<p>But both of these positions would inevitably require Hartman to redefine what he means by mizvah and to reconsider the issue of the authority of Torah, thereby undermining the traditionalist cast of his entire study. (His subtitle is, after all, &#8220;The Innovative Spirit in Traditional Judaism&#8221;). In fact, under both of these models, the authority is transferred from God to the community. Both poles of the dialectic, the autonomous and the theonomous, become embodied within the community. But has not Hartman, himself, conceded this result in accepting Jacob Katz&#8217;s definition of the limits of interpretive freedom as &#8220;. . . what the community is in fact prepared to accept as Torah&#8221;? </p>
<p>On this issue, then, Hartman is in a bind. As a result, the issue is avoided and his covenantal anthropology, however acutely perceived, authentically rooted and programmatically desirable, floats in a theological vacuum. </p>
<p>In fact, A Living Covenant ends up as a much richer and more substantial version of Eliezer Berkovits&#8217; Not in Heaven, with much the same shortcomings. Like Hartman, Berkovits argues for a more open recognition of the subjective, flexible, pluralistic understanding of the halakhic process as a legitimately human undertaking. Berkovits, too, plumbs the tanur shel akhnai anecdote which he interprets, much as Hartman does, as insisting on &#8220;the human share and responsibility in the interpretation and administration of the revealed Word of God (sic)&#8221;, and that &#8220;the affairs of men cannot be guided by absolute objectivity, but only by human objectivity.&#8221; Halakhah represents not &#8220;objective truth&#8221; but &#8220;pragmatic validity&#8221; (p.48). &#8220;Once a Jew accepts the Torah from Sinai, whatever it teaches him in his search for its meaning and message is the word of God for him&#8221; (p.51). Berkovits repeatedly invokes what he calls the &#8220;halakhic conscience&#8221; which he perceives as impelling the rabbis to limit the application of, or, at times, even render inoperative, a piece of biblical legislation which they find morally offensive (p.28). But, again, one searches in vain for a theology of revelation which might ground his understanding of the halakhic process. </p>
<p>While Berkovits limits his argument to the issue of halakhic development, Hartman&#8217;s canvass is much broader. It encompasses a phenomenology of much of Jewish religious life and teaching. The book remains, then, a passionately argued and authentically documented defense of a humanistic, pluralistic, flexible, and creative reading of traditional Judaism. Programmatically, then, it serves as an apologia for Modern or Centrist Orthodoxy. This position is clearly under siege today, both in Israel and in America. If anything, the current wave of fundamentalism in religion reflects a preference for the temper of submission and self-denial which Hartman rejects. This contemporary style in religion, together with Hartman&#8217;s critique of much of Soloveitchik&#8217;s theology, will unquestionably render this volume suspect in the eyes of precisely those of Hartman&#8217;s confreres who could benefit most from his inquiry. If this is, indeed, the outcome, the Jewish theologically concerned community as a whole will be the loser. </p>
<p>But, if for no other reason, this book should be studied and taught for its concluding chapter, &#8220;The Third Jewish Commonwealth.&#8221; Here, Hartman applies his reading of Judaism to the new challenges posed by the creation of the State of Israel. He insists that even if we reject, as he does, a simplistic reading of the rebirth of Israel in messianic terms as reflecting God&#8217;s overt intervention in history, this event can yet exert extraordinary religious influence on the life of the community. Economic, social, and political issues, the moral quality of the army, the exercise of power moderated by moral sensitivity, can all be brought under the purview of Torah.<br />
In fact, Israel also exposes the moral and spiritual inadequacies in the Jewish tradition and can thus provide &#8221; . . . unique conditions for a serious critique of Judaism as it is practiced by commited halakhic Jews&#8221; (p.294). </p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, then, Hartman calls for a thoroughgoing re-evaluation of the place of religion and halakhah in Israeli life. But even beyond this, the chapter provides the most compelling argument for the Jew&#8217;s throwing his lot in with Israel in a direct and personal way, not, as the usual Zionist rhetoric has it, because diaspora Judaism is doomed, but, rather, because Israel provides the broadest possible canvass for Judaism&#8217;s engagement with modernity.</p></blockquote>

				<p>I am proud that two former students are finishing their PHD’s and are continuing as academics. Unfortunately, Modern Orthodox tends to confuse being a wonker or engaging in &#8220;hocking&#8221; about scholarship with actual academia. Ringel defends on June 30th. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Ringel, The Sephardic Rabbinate, Sephardic Yeshivot, and the Shas Educational System, Brandeis University</strong> (Near Eastern and Judaic Studies)<br />
Joseph Ringel’s dissertation explores the debates over Sephardic identity by examining how Shas’ network of schools and Sepahrdic yeshivot transmit what they consider to be Sepahrdic values in the student body. This process of identity reconstruction includes the search for a usable past in order to confront the challenges modernity poses to the Sephardic religious tradition – this process has resulted in the preservation of certain religious practices and traditions, the creation of new customs and ideas through re-interpretation, and the misinterpretation and distortion of other elements of the Sephardic tradition. In exploring the debates within the Sephardic world surrounding Shas’ reconstruction of Sephardic identity, Ringel’s dissertation explores the complexities of connecting past experiences and traditions to current realities.</p>
<p><strong>Joshua Z. Teplitsky, Between Court Jew and Jewish Court: David Oppenheim, the Prague Rabbinate, and eighteenth-century Jewish politics, New York University </strong></p>
<p>David Oppenheim (1664-1736) was, among other things, the scion of a rabbinic family, the chief rabbi of Moravia and then of Prague and Bohemia, a legal authority, and a Talmudic commentator. Oppenheim’s various roles placed him at the crossroads of several important developments of the early modern period for both the history of Jewish political cultural development and the history of the Habsburg monarchy and its imperial politics.  Joshua Teplitsky’s dissertation views the changes in the relationship between the Habsburg state and local Jewish communities in the early modern period through the lens of Oppenheim’s career.</p>
<p>Not a student but a relevant topic. It is on how the whole question of authority (serara) in the public sphere is an American Christian influence.<br />
<strong>Caroline Block, The Spirit of Tradition and the Institution of Authority: Knowledge and Community in American Orthodox Women’s Talmud Programs, Johns Hopkins University (Anthropology)</strong><br />
Caroline Block notes that while these women are enrolled in postgraduate programs that are part of the Judaic tradition of preparing for rabbinic ordination through textual studies, they are also profoundly affected by the American practice of denominationalism, particularly due to the way in which the rabbinate in the U.S. has been influenced by the Protestant tradition, and “rabbi” has come to refer not to an academic distinction, but to a job in the public sphere. Block’s dissertation explores the tensions of American Jewish denominationalism and particularly how denominationalism relates to Modern Orthodoxy.</p>

				<p>My recent post on the <a href="../../../../2011/06/10/yct-graduation-speech-where-is-the-promised-land/index.html">YCT graduation speech</a> generated a large bevy of comments; go read them -many of them are excellent. But is seems to have hit a raw nerve with some readers of the blog. Was this nerve hidden until now?</p>
<p>The comments did not deal with the speech itself. The comments offered several detailed and well thought out comments on Modern Orthodoxy, way beyond what we are used to hearing. Go read them.</p>
<p>It seems to have revealed the live issue among the commenters. But what was the issue? What was the meta-issue at stake? There seems to be two clear sides with at least 6-7 on each side. Neither side was advocates of an intellectual ghetto and neither side wanted to relinquish Orthodoxy.  Yet, half the commenters evoked a visceral reaction from the other half who called the first half negative or cynical.  So what is the dividing line? Why so emotional? </p>
<p>One side wants to be Orthodox and read Hegel, Derrida, and Biblical criticism but does not work on resolving any problems. This position seems to strike the other side as a rejection of Modern Orthodoxy, as Neo-Haredi, as anti-Orthodox. Why?  Is the other side clamoring for synthesis works? And why the emotions?</p>
<p>Is it that one side sees Orthodoxy as a social imaginary in the Charles Taylor sense, non-foundational and not subject to apologetics. </p>
<p>One side wants Torah uMadda volumes of apologetics that are comforting even if they don’t prove anything because maybe they do prove something? Or they show the strength of Orthodoxy to confront modernity.</p>
<p>Is it that one side wants truth claims even if apologetic and the other side relinquishes the need for truth?</p>
<p>Is it that one side thinks that one must be invested in a specific ideological project called Modern Orthodoxy and the other more  loquacious side believes that one can be committed to Orthodoxy and Western culture without a specific ideological project, or to a specific project of synthesis?</p>
<p>Is it simply that one side has a double truth theory and the other side has a single truth theory. Why does the position of Averroes, Maimonides, Albalag, Narboni, Ibn Caspi  or in modern times Krokhmal and Isaac Breuer seem to betray Orthodoxy to the other side? </p>
<p>Is this mid-brow vs high-brow?</p>
<p>And what about the struggle and angst? Do people on the synthesis side really think that everyone has to have it? Or is it just a need for confrontation of ideas and not necessary angst?</p>
<p>There are lots of good lines to quote in all the substantive comments but to give one:<br />
Isaac- “Maybe the whole struggling trope is an existential answer to the contradictions of modernity and Orthodoxy, rather than a strategy for overcoming or resolving them.”</p>
<p>Deep struggle with ideas in graduate school in a chosen discipline makes sense after training a field for many years and where one knows the prior data and method. Then struggle can lead to new knowledge. But does intellectual struggle to achieve synthesis and confrontation mean something without training or enough prior mastery of the problem so that one can formulate something of significance? Is it important to struggle to go though open doors?</p>
<p>Bottom line- some blogs have their identity on a fault line of  pro and con skepticism, others are pro and con feminism,  it seems this topic is one of the live fault lines on this blog. So those of you who responded viscerally or felt that the anti-synthesis side is wrong. What is the issue?</p>
<p>So Nachum, Jon, Isaac – how do you explain the fault line? Even if you called the other side negative – what do you offer in its place that AS &amp; EJ did not offer? </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I was out of town, but this past month <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Barton_%28author%29">David Barton</a> was featured in the New York Times and on the John Stewart show. Barton is a Christian Conservative author who preaches a Christian view of the past, corresponding to the Jewish history as it should have been, Artscroll approach. He is a revisionist of the first order. What is interesting for me is that lesser authors are arguing with him about how he distorts the truth and is not academic. But the better reviews know right for the start that he is no doing anything corresponding to academic research, so they ask: what is his religious appeal? How does he come up with his opinions? They treat him as object, nor subject.</p>
<p>This had me thinking about the Modern Orthodox types who criticize Artscroll history, as if it was all about comparative methodology. They tend not to treat the Yeshivish versions of the past as object for study or beneath critique. </p>
<p>The debate around Barton opens up questions of how the Evangelical or Orthodox determine who gets to give a homily or write narratives about the past. What is an expert, degrees, and qualifications to write a religious narrative that is not academic? Why are bad credentials seen as good? The Evangelicals have many similar cases of a teacher in an Evangelical school paskening American history, preachers and roshei yeshiva who fracture history, or an implicit providential exceptionalism, which confuses  the theological mesorah with the  secular activity of the historian.</p>
<p>Actual scholars don’t care or don’t debate the views of Evangelicals on the Founding Fathers, nor do Jewish academics care to even refute Roshei Yeshivah about their views of Maimonides, Rabbi SR Hirsch or the Holocaust. They don’t refute them they are not historical- there is no philology, no historical context, no application of social sciences. They consider the relgious stories as products, manufactured accounts for a specific audience.</p>
<p>This first review is from a <a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/4589/selling_the_idea_of_a_christian_nation%3A_david_barton%E2%80%99s_alternate_intellectual_universe/">trained Evangelical historian Paul Harvey</a> who works on the role of religion in American history, but he feels David Barton does not deserve to be called a historian. And that it does not pay to refute him because his audience wont care.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t question the necessity of pointing out Barton’s history of outright falsehoods, explaining the fallacies of his presentism (as in using a 1765 sermon or a 1792 congressional vote to show that the original intent of the founders was to oppose bailout and stimulus plans), and introducing to non-experts the abundant evidence calling his historical worldview of the Christian Founders into question. Yet while these kinds of refutations are necessary, they are not sufficient. That’s because Barton’s project is not fundamentally an historical one.</p>
<p><strong>Barton v. the Historical Profession</strong></p>
<p>That’s why historians’ takedown of his ahistorical approach ultimately won’t matter that much. Nor will historians’ explanations of his presentism, and his obvious and unapologetic ideological agenda (albeit considerably muted for his appearance on The Daily Show). While all the historians’ refutations are good and necessary, ultimately they won’t matter for the audience which exists in his alternate intellectual universe, one described in much greater detail in my colleague Randall Stephens’ forthcoming book The Anointed: Evangelical Experts in a Secular Age.</p>
<p>And it’s also why insinuations about his pedigree (a degree in education from Oral Roberts University) will only heighten his followers’ sense of the cultural elitism of his critics. </p>
<p><strong>Ideas Packaged as Products</strong></p>
<p>Some of that is because of the skill of Barton and his organization WallBuilders at ideological entrepreneurialism. Barton’s intent is not to produce “scholarship,” but to influence public policy. He simply is playing a different game than worrying about scholarly credibility, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. His game is to inundate public policy makers (including local and state education boards as well as Congress) with ideas packaged as products that will move policy.<br />
Historical scholarship moves slowly and carefully, usually shunning the public arena; Barton’s proof-texting, by contrast, supplies ready-made (if sometimes made-up) quotations ready for use in the latest public policy debate, whether they involve school prayer, abortion, the wonders of supply-side economics, the Defense of Marriage Act, or the capital gains tax. </p>
<p>Besides this sort of organizational skill and personal charisma, however, Barton’s success at withstanding the phalanx of professional critics comes because he taps into a long history of “Christian Nation” providentialism.</p>
<p><strong>A Manufactured “Debate”</strong></p>
<p>The issue, then, is not Christian conservatives advocating their views in the public square. The problem, rather, is their claim (at least in places such as The Daily Show or the New York Times) that their Providentialist beliefs and readings of documents from the past represent a kind of legitimate scholarship that should have its place in the public “debate.”</p>
<p>Aside from its remarkable influence on the writing of American textbooks, perhaps the biggest success of the Christian nationalist intellectual ideological universe is to insert points of controversy where there aren’t any in actuality.<br />
But the presentation of the American certificates of birth—the “short form” of the Declaration of Independence, and the “long form” of the Constitution—will not quiet the Christian Nation “debate.”</p>
<p>I use the term “debate” in quotes because it is fraudulent. Even advocates of the viewpoint of the “godless Constitution” (such as historians Isaac Kramnick and R. Laurence Moore) fully understand the religious base of American history. They suggest simply (as Jon Stewart was trying to get at) that the framers rather deliberately excluded religion, not because they sought an exclusion of religion from the public square, but simply to avoid any special privileges for it at the federal level. Eventually, those views were incorporated into state laws through the 14th Amendment, through the pluralization of American life in the twentieth century, and through the epochal court cases of the 1940s through the 1970s.</p>
<p>The Christian Nation “debate” is not really an intellectual contest between legitimate contending viewpoints. Instead, it is a manufactured “controversy”<br />
On one side are purveyors of a rich and complex view of the past, including most historians who have written and debated fiercely about the founding era. The “other side” is a group of ideological entrepreneurs who have created an alternate intellectual universe based on a historical fundamentalism. In their drive to create a usable past, they show little respect for the past as a foreign country.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.philipvickersfithian.com/2011/05/harvey-weighs-in-on-david-barton-at.html">This next historian</a> points out how Evangelicals don’t know there are other positions out there and they frame everything as “secular academics” vs Evangelicals. They don’t realize that there could be an Orthodox historian.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I think what prevents me from doing so is the fact that there are many people out there&#8211;mostly evangelical Christians&#8211;who embrace Barton&#8217;s ideas because they are unaware that any other Christian position on this Christian nation debate exists.  I have seen this first hand as I have traveled to churches and taught Sunday School classes.  There are a lot of people who can&#8217;t imagine that a fellow evangelical could disagree with Barton.  When evangelicals learn that such a position exists some of them are open to change.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/139197.html">Here is a major Clearinghouse page</a> of the reviews and reactions to Barton.</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/american-scripture-how-david-barton-won-the-christian-right/238603/"><br />
My final quote is from the Atlantic</a>, written by a former Maimo Student of mine, Yoni Applebaum. He points out Evangelicals read history the same way the read Bible, directly from the text and without a sense of historical distance. One reads an Eighteenth century documents without philology or context and as having a message for today. How do Orthodox accounts of the past allow carry over their techniques from the beis medrash? Applebaum says that it is not about credentials, method, or peer review.His critics are barking up the wrong tree.  It works because it is part of the same process of Evangelical reading of scripture by opening the text and laying on one&#8217;s heart. What is the Yeshivish process of history as a phenomena of modern popular relgion?</p>
<blockquote><p>Barton&#8217;s errors, exaggerations, and elisions have been exhaustively cataloged; no credible historian defends his work or his conclusions. And yet millions continue to find his message compelling. Why do they trust him?</p>
<p>Barton himself provides an answer on his organization&#8217;s website: </p>
<p>The heart of our educational work, and that which makes WallBuilders so unique, is our library of rare books. We have collected thousands of first-edition works of our Founding Fathers &#8212; including their own handwritten documents &#8212; and it is primarily in these original sources that we conduct our research. </p>
<p>This emphasis on primary sources is the cornerstone of Barton&#8217;s pitch. He explained to Jon Stewart that he is in the business of &#8220;historical reclamation,&#8221; adding that he has &#8220;about a hundred thousand documents from before 1812.&#8221; He took the Times reporter on a tour of his library, showing off his volumes and their yellowed pages. And he uses these documents to brush aside complaints that he lacks any formal academic training in history. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a doctorate in that, no,&#8221; he told Stewart. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot of documents &#8230; and what I got taught and what I&#8217;ve seen in the actual documents aren&#8217;t the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps most crucially, Barton insists that the meanings of these texts should require no additional context.</p>
<p>Barton&#8217;s focus on returning to the original text, and his pointed disdain for the scholars whom he accuses of distorting its plain meaning, seems to resonate with his largely evangelical audience. There is a reason for this. It echoes the general doctrine of sola scriptura, the bedrock of the Reformation, that the text of the Bible alone contains the knowledge necessary for salvation. It draws on the tradition of prooftexting, using verses lifted from a larger text to buttress specific points. And in particular, it mirrors the notion of the perspicuity of Scripture &#8212; that its essential teachings are sufficiently clear that &#8220;not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.&#8221; </p>
<p>In other words, Barton frames historical texts in the manner that his audience is accustomed to encountering the other texts that it routinely studies. He discards the accreted mass of scholarly interpretations, just as Reformation preachers jettisoned the layers of scholastic traditions. He selects key passages for use as texts, and constructs his historical sermons around them. And, perhaps most crucially, he insists that the meanings of these texts should require no additional context; that they are readily evident to all who have eyes to see, and a mind to understand and discern. He proclaims a professoriate of all believers.</p>
<p>When his critics insist that he subject his work to peer review, or disparage his credentials and his logic, they only reinforce the strength of his appeal to his target audience.</p></blockquote>
