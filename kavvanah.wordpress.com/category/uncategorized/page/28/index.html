				<p>The contextual study of the Talmud has generally focused on the Greco-Roman historical context. Asher Gulak in the field of Mishpat Ivri compared Roman and Talmudic Law, Boaz Cohen as a Talmudist compared concepts, and historian Shaye Cohen of Harvard situates Rabbinic family law in Roman context. In contrast, Chief Rabbi Herzog rejected the very idea of comparison. However for many, there was a standoff for decades between Erwin R. Goodenough who saw Judaism entirely enculturated in pagan Greco-Roman culture and Saul Lieberman who limited the influence to legal terms. Now, with the turn to cultural studies, Daniel Boyarin and others return the field to situating Rabbinics as part of a Greco-cultural world. </p>
<p>But what of Babylonian influence on the Talmud? Technically, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanian">we are speaking of the Sasanian dynasty</a> that took power from the Parthians in 226 CE. It was bureaucratically centered in Mesopotamia which had a majority of Aramaic speakers, including Jews, Christians, and Mandeans, but also a ruling Persian speaking population. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism">Their religion was Zoroastrian.</a> Most scholars of the Talmud only made brief note of the context, leaving the discussion mainly to those in the field of religion.  </p>
<p>They either saw Zoroastrian religion as polluting the pure ethics of the prophets or a conduit of perennial wisdom. <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/15283-zoroastrianism#anchor6">They attributed</a> much of the <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14216-talmudic-law#anchor8">worldview unique to the Babylonian Talmud</a> to this influence, including Talmudic magic, sorcery, angelology, demons as well as menstruation and purity laws. They also noted that Adam and Eve in the Bavli reflect the Iranian Mashya (man) and Mashyana, the Iranian Adam (man) and Eve. R. C. Zaehner, a professor of Eastern religions, argues for Zoroastrianism&#8217;s direct influence on Jewish eschatological myths, especially the resurrection of the dead with rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Alexander Kohut, who edited and vastly expanded the classic 11th-century talmudic dictionary, the Arukh, and filled it with Persian etymologies, and was fascinated by the world of Zoroastrian angelology and demonology, charted many correspondences between the Persian system and its Jewish counterpart. The Austrian talmudist Isaac Hirsch Weiss was drawn to parallels between Zoroastrianism and the Talmud; he listed a number of critical areas in which, he argued, the rabbis had adopted Persian practices.  Just as interesting, in other places Weiss claimed to have found signs of resistance—instances in which rabbis established practices specifically as a means of precluding certain &#8220;Persianisms.&#8221; </p>
<p>A Galician scholar Joshua Heschel Schorr wanted to reform his religion radically by subjecting it to the rules of logic and a rationalistic approach.  Schorr did not see in the ancient Iranian tradition an admirable &#8220;natural&#8221; religion or otherwise sagacious philosophical system.  In Schorr&#8217;s orientalism, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesta">Zoroastrian &#8220;Bible,&#8221; or Avesta</a>, was filled with strange and preposterous superstitions.  Any parallel he found between the Avesta and the Bible or Talmud was a sign of corruption in the latter and a reason for excision and reform.</p>
<p>In general, the Iranian element has been relatively slighted. Jacob Neusner began to frame some of his research in terms that encompassed the study of Sassanian Babylonia; in 1982, the late E.S. Rosenthal urged the mastery of Middle Persian, the Sassanian lingua franca, as a gateway to Talmud study. However recently Isaiah Gafni, the historian had a student <a href="http://huji.academia.edu/GeoffreyHerman">Geoffrey Herman</a> who is developing the Iranian historical context and <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/talmud-ii">Yaakov Elman, the Talmudist</a> has a student Shai Secunda who is publishing a book giving an introduction to the Iranian situated Talmud, called appropriately <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iranian-Talmud-Sasanian-Divinations-Rereading/dp/0812245709/ref=la_B00D0N1SXM_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380829972&amp;sr=1-1">The Iranian Talmud.</a> (University of Pennsylvania Press)[go order it] </p>
<p><a href="http://huji.academia.edu/ShaiSecunda">Shai Secunda</a> is a scholar at the Martin Buber Society of Fellows at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a graduate of Ner Yisrael and a PhD from BRGS. He wrote his dissertation on <strong>&#8220;Dashtana &#8211; &#8216;Ki derekh nashim li'&#8221; : a study of the Babylonian rabbinic law of menstruation in relation to corresponding Zoroastrian texts,&#8221;</strong> which will be the topic of his second book. This semester he is teaching at Hebrew University <strong>“Women, Ritual and Religion in Late Antique Judaism.”</strong> In his forthcoming article  <strong>&#8220;Zoroastrian and Rabbinic ‘Genealogies&#8217; of Menstruation: Medicine, Myth, and Misogyny”</strong> he writes</p>
<blockquote><p>The gender politics of textual production dictate that for the most part, ancient religious works which have survived into modern times were produced by and for men. When women are the subject of these texts, it is always through the male gaze. Hence female physiological processes, like menstruation, are often interpreted via male physiognomy, and the normative body is usually the male body. When we look at the way menstruation is depicted in male-authored texts, we find that at the very least the phenomenon is a source of wonder, if not always revulsion and misogyny.</p>
<p>For Sasanian rabbis and Zorasterian dadwars, menstruation was a physiological phenomenon accompanied by a set of prohibitions and purification practices… This paper will attempt a “genealogy” of menstruation in Judaism and Zoroastrianism that will include hitherto neglected texts like the Zand ī fragard ī jud-dēw-dād. The picture that emerges is one of intersecting discourses, many of which betray interaction between the two communities, yet also differences in outlook that remained.</p></blockquote>
<p>1)	<strong>Why is what you do exciting and interesting? How is what you do different than the fictional source critic David Malter from Potok?</strong></p>
<p>I am blessed to be able to get up each morning, sit down in an office lined with books and a up-to-date computer, and read the same texts that Jews have been obsessing over for so long, and yet think about the infinite new and (I hope) important things that remain to be said – from the level of what the actual text (or texts) is, to how the  text was produced, how it relates to its historical context, how it continued to affect Jews in the middle ages, and what it still means to Jews – and non-Jews – today.  </p>
<p>Talmudic Scholars such as “Malter” and Halivni are, ironically, very traditional scholars. They charted out a specific derekh ha-limud – no simply task – and stuck with it to the very end. It may be at variance with yeshivish views of the Talmud and mesorah, but you find that even when pure yeshiva bochurim start reading <em>Meqorot u-Mesorot,</em> they quickly find their way. Prior approaches were not really engaged in other disciplines beyond philology – such as literary theory, feminist criticism, history of religions, etc.  I’m trying to do more integrating across the humanities – history of religions, literary theory, gender, etc. And I acknowledge that this desire for integration is one of the (many) things Neusner did for the field. Also, and this is no false modesty, Halivni and Lieberman were iluyim, while I am just someone who tries to work hard and hone a set of integrated methods for productively reading rabbinic literature. </p>

<p>2)<strong>	What does adding the Iranian context add? </strong></p>
<p>However, the Iranian Talmud focuses on Zoroastrian texts written in Middle Persian (an ancestor of the Modern Persian spoken by Iranians today) because to my mind this to my mind is the most promising site of comparison.  On the most basic level, the linguistic context of Iran undoubtedly influenced the Bavli. We have for example a few hundred Iranian &#8211; usually Middle Persian &#8211; loanwords in Babylonian Jewish Aramaic. Quite simply, knowing Iranian languages leads to a more accurate understanding of the Bavli when it uses these loanwords. </p>
<p>A favorite loanword of mine, the word פיקאר (dispute), shows up in the best textual witnesses to a story in Taanit 24b. The printed edition and less reliable manuscripts have the rather bland עסק דברים (dealings), which probably originated as a late gloss on the rare Iranian term. In the story, King Shapur II&#8217;s mother, Ifra Hormiz, is actually telling her son to avoid disputing the Jews, not simply having dealings with them. </p>
<p>Crucially, the linguistic connections can act as a gateway to appreciating more profound interactions between the Bavli and other Iranian texts from the same period, offering the Bavli&#8217;s literary context.  In terms of my example from Taanit, an Iranian text that may have been part of the Sasanian &#8220;Book of Kings&#8221; describes Shapur II&#8217;s efforts to engage all of his subjects in disputes (pahikārišn). The talmudic storyteller was apparently tapping into the same literary tradition. I have other examples in the book that show that the amoraim and/or talmudic redactors were aware of Iranian (probably oral) texts and participated in the production of Sasanian &#8220;literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>While these textual intersections are interesting, usually when the public learns about people like me working on the Bavli&#8217;s Iranian context, they want to hear about sexy, direct, and unassailable evidence of Zoroastrian influence on halakha or core theological concepts. The truth is rarely that simple, but awareness of the Iranian context does help us appreciate the protracted development of certain, sometimes central Jewish institutions. I discuss at length some talmudic beliefs about hell in the book. My friend <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1868922/_Redesigning_Tzitzit_in_the_Babylonian_Talmud_in_Light_of_Literary_Depictions_of_the_Zoroastrian_Kustig_%20yishai%20kiel">Yishai Kiel has suggested, in a Festschrift in honor of Yaakov Elman,</a> that the Bavli&#8217;s insistence on wearing a &#8216;tallit qatan&#8217; even when one would not otherwise be obligated to do so may have been influenced by the similar Zoroastrian requirement to tie the kustig- a ritual belt. These are nice explanations that account for some of the Bavli&#8217;s novel beliefs and requirements, although the mechanics about how this sort of influence might have operated needs to be worked out. </p>
<p>3)      <strong>How does your approach relate to traditional Gemara learning and halakhah</strong><br />
There are traditionalists who see the Bavli as virtually God-given. As the old wort goes, אמר מר stands for אמר משה רבנו. My book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Iranian-Talmud-Divinations-Rereading/dp/0812245709"><em>The Iranian Talmud</em></a> is an academic book and not specifically directed at this community, though I did try to write it in a relatively accessible manner. </p>
<p>Anyone that understands how halakha actually works knows that it doesn&#8217;t stand or fall by demonstrating that a halakhic institution is based on a misinterpretation of a gemara, a printing error, or possible evidence of foreign influence. The real challenges to halakha for modern Jews do not come from philology or history of religions, rather from profound shifts in our cultural assumptions, for example the equality of women.  </p>
<p>Historical context leads to a much fuller experience of Talmud Torah. As for those who think that Talmud cannot have a cultural context because it is the mesorah, I&#8217;m not sure my theology would work for them. Nevertheless, I think most yeshivaleit have a notion of &#8220;the hashgacha made it develop that way.&#8221; Which means you can still study how the &#8220;hashgacha&#8221; made it develop.</p>
<p>4)     <strong> How is this different than the work done on Greco-Roman influence on the Talmud by Boaz Cohen, Shaya J. D. Cohen, and others?</strong><br />
Well for one, Classics is a far more developed field, and Talmudists have been engaged with it on a high level for longer. So the Cohens and their colleagues are able to build scholarship on a much stronger foundation. But more importantly, the centrality of ritual in everyday Zoroastrian life and the discursiveness of Middle Persian legal and exegetical literature is profoundly different from the vast majority of Greco-Roman literature. Many of the surviving Middle Persian texts simply &#8220;feel&#8221; more rabbinic. They deal with subjects like impurity and more specifically the transmission of impurity in three-dimensional space. After learning Ohalot, you can really appreciate what they are trying to do. And this is just one example among manny. Also, Middle Persian literature contains disputes that are at times structured kind of like basic talmudic sugyot. Plus, they have a complex exegetical relationship with “Scripture,” namely, the Avesta.<br />
Academics have also expressed some skepticism, and are weary of terms like &#8220;influence&#8221; and what they represent. Indeed, so am I. In the last chapter of the book I try to develop some methods of reading that focus on the texts themselves, and which show how we must first chart the internal development of rabbinic (and Zoroastrian) texts before considering how they might have interacted with relevant Iranian parallels. </p>
<p>5)     <strong> How is the Talmud closer to Sasanian law than Roman law?</strong><br />
This is one of the most fascinating aspects of law in Iran. While relatively early on in the history of Roman law, civil law was no longer the domain of the priests, in Sasanian law many of the jurists that show up in ritual discussions are also ruling in what we would call purely civil contexts. Legal systems that have two-way traffic between ritual and civil domains develop in interesting ways. I actually think it&#8217;s one of the things that make halakha what it is and so fascinating. It&#8217;s because of this two way traffic that, for example, property rights invade the ritual sphere in halakha &#8211; think the mitzvah of taking arba minim which must be, legally, owned. Similarly, the role that &#8216;intention&#8217; comes to play in non-ritual halakha, I believe, is at least partially indebted to the ritual side of rabbinic law. We find some of the same features in Zoroastrian / Sasanian law.</p>
<p>6)     <strong> In your <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1845569/The_Construction_Composition_and_Idealization_of_the_Female_Body_in_Rabbinic_Literature_and_Parallel_Iranian_Texts">article in Nashim,</a> you show that the du-partzufim of the Talmud refers to an Iranian story and not the Greek story? Why is that important? </strong></p>
<p>I respond there to Daniel Boyarin’s suggestion in his influential book, <em>Carnal Israel,</em> that the midrash about Adam and Eve being created as a kind of two-sided androgyne was a rabbinic response to Neo-platonic ideas.  By comparing the midrash not just with Classical sources, but also with texts from across the Indo-European spectrum – including Iranian – I argue that in fact, the rabbis weren&#8217;t explicitly, polemically rejecting Neo-platonic ideas by describing a physical Adam-Eve creature in Eden, but participating in a version of the Indo-European myth. This is clear since other versions of the myth show up in, for example, late antique Zoroastrian texts that were not at all Neo-Platonic. Practically speaking, this awareness means that we need to stop thinking of classical Judaism (up until Judaism today)as something that emerged from an encounter between Jerusalem and Athens. There also is Pumbedita and the Sasanian winter capital, Ctesiphon. (<a href="http://www.academia.edu/1845569/The_Construction_Composition_and_Idealization_of_the_Female_Body_in_Rabbinic_Literature_and_Parallel_Iranian_Texts">see article</a>)</p>
<p>7) <strong>What are the best things to come out in the field in the 30 years since the early work of Shamma Friedman? </strong><br />
There&#8217;s so much that has happened beyond Talmudic source-criticism. Some of the developments that I appreciate the most include the rabbinic literature + literary/folk theory school, which in Israel took off with the late Dov Noy and Yonah Frankel, and was advanced in Israel especially by Galit Hasan-Rokem and Josh Levinson and in the US by Jeffrey Rubenstein and others too.  The new generation of law and narrative people is quite exciting, such as Barry Wimpfheimer and Moshe Simon-Shoshan, and Hasan-Rokem&#8217;s student, Dina Stein, who is the best practitioner of Talmud and Theory out there. </p>
<p>Gender also comes to mind. We have, apart from Boyarin, scholars such as Tal Ilan who has devoted enormous resources to feminist history and commentary, and Ishay Rosen-Zvi who has melded philology and gender criticism in fascinating ways. It’s great to see how along with more awareness of feminist critiques in the broader community, academic talmudists are hard at work thinking about how to use feminist concerns to read rabbinic texts more productively. I hope that more of the academic work on gender will make its way into the broader community, and also that vice versa, the community’s concerns and interest will encourage and dialog with scholarship. This is already happening to an extent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, also during this time the philologists have finally published important editions of classical rabbinic texts. Menahem Kahana&#8217;s dream edition of Sifrei Bamidbar was produced and finally published. It will set the standard for the foreseeable future. It is based on decades of running after every scrap of manuscript evidence in the world – from the great British libraries to the former Soviet houses of learning – and then writing an extensive commentary (which is not fully published yet) that takes into account every relevant parallel. When you pick up the edition you can see that the manuscript variants and parallel texts make an enormous difference in understanding the basic meaning of the midrash. Most importantly, Kahana has devoted years of thinking about how to make an edition that is both exacting, accurate, and accessible. </p>
<p>And after a decades-long delay, virtually every scrap of parchment on which Talmudic literature is written is classified in a three volume catalog. This was a project that dates back to the beginnings of Talmud scholarship at the Hebrew University, which survived years when only Israeli soldiers were stationed on Mount Scopus, and which was the life’s work of one of the century’s greatest Talmudists – Yaakov Sussman. The catalog is briefly discussed on the Talmud blog (<a href="http://thetalmudblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/shavua-hasefer-2012/" rel="nofollow">http://thetalmudblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/shavua-hasefer-2012/</a>)</p>
<p>And the biggest thing that happened in the last thirty years? One word &#8211; digitization. It changed everything: How we conduct research using multi-variable searches, how we read and manipulate the talmudic text, etc etc. Along with Elli Fischer I hope to write a book, that began as a review of the Artscroll Talmud app at the Jewish Review of Books, that will look at digitization and Jewish learning. (link: <a href="http://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/83/brave-new-bavli-talmud-in-the-age-of-the-ipad/" rel="nofollow">http://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/83/brave-new-bavli-talmud-in-the-age-of-the-ipad/</a>)</p>
<p>8) <strong>Have you taken up an interest in Zoroastrianism? Do you have a desire to visit Iran or know more about its culture?</strong><br />
I am very interested in Zoroastrianism, and publish in Iranian studies journals, sometimes without direct mention of Jewish studies. I am also interested in the modern day religion which is struggling to survive. I also am interested in modern day Iran and have been lucky enough to have some – very limited – contact with Iranists working in Iran today. And I have literally dreamed about walking around Tehran. I fervently hope that I one day will be able to do so while awake. The rich world of Iranian Jewish cultural production fascinated me as well, especially the great Judeo-Persian poets. All that said, I am professionally only engaged with rabbinic lit on the one hand, and pre-Islamic Iranian studies on the other.</p>

				<p>The Pew Research Center just released <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/10/jewish-american-survey-full-report.pdf">a major 200 page study of American Jewry</a> including both demography and affiliation. If the Jewish community could not afford or agree on a major study, then the Pew foundation picked up the slack. Here are some of the statistic that I found interesting. The Forward has <a href="http://forward.com/articles/184795/jews-bound-by-shared-beliefs-even-as-markers-of-fa/?p=all#ixzz2gRMcsIW8">a nice general article that shows thought and has comments from professionals.</a></p>
<p>Pew estimates that there are 6.7 million American Jews overall, including 5.3 million adults.</p>
<p>Jews make up a smaller percentage of America due to Hispanic immigration, and the percentage of Jews by religion among Hispanics is even lower than in the general public. On the other hand, there have been two major waves of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union in recent decades, and as a result,the share of  Jewish adults who are foreign-born today (14%) is only a little lower than the share of all U.S.</p>
<p>Despite the changes in Jewish identity in America, 94% of U.S. Jews say they are proud to be Jewish. Three-quarters of  U.S. Jews  also say they have “a strong sense of belonging to the Jewish people.”</p>
<p>The survey tolls the end of the triumphalist sense of an Orthodox return. The losses from Orthodoxy are several times larger than the gains. The survey finds that approximately one-quarter of people who were  raised Orthodox have since become Conservative or Reform Jews, Just 7% of Jews raised in the Reform movement have become Conservative or  Orthodox, and just 4% of those raised in Conservative Judaism have become Orthodox.  This was despite the millions spent on an army of kiruv workers during those years.  </p>
<p>The big news is that 17% of the 20-somethings have left Orthodoxy but a whopping 43% left Orthodoxy from the millennial and gen x generations, and these younger generations were raised after the triumphal rise of a more committed Orthodoxy.  Old news was that 59% of the baby boomers raised Orthodox left, but that was a different era when many were non-observant Orthodox to start.</p>

<p>Rates of intermarriage among Jews are perhaps most directly comparable to rates of intermarriage among other relatively small U.S. religious groups, such  as Mormons and Muslims. Same basic statistics no more or less just proportional to our numbers.</p>
<p>One-in-ten Jews identify with Orthodox Judaism (10%),  including 6% who belong to Ultra-Orthodox groups and 3% who are Modern Orthodox. This would yield 670, 000 Orthodox Jews. 202, 000 Modern Orthodox, 403, 000 Ultra-Orthodox. (From other studies we have a percentage of over 75% of this Hasidim and less than 25% yeshivish, maybe as low as 16%. The yeshiva world makes much noise for its size.). and we have 101, 000 of other including Sfardim, Edot Hamizrah, Israelis, immigrants from Latin America and the Former Soviet Union who self-identify as Orthodox but not as Modern Orthodox or Ultra-Orthodox.</p>
<p>Here is a shocker. When asked: Can you be Jewish and not believe in God? The following numbers said yes. Notice that Modern Orthodoxy has the least concern for God. (Hashem Yirachem!)<br />
Ultra-Orthodox 50  Modern Orthodox 70  Conservative 56  Reform 66<br />
When asked about their own belief in God as yes, somewhat/unsure,  or no, we have 19% of Modern Orthodox as unsure and 3 % as outright deniers.<br />
Ultra-Orthodox   96 , 2, 1,<br />
Modern    77   19    3<br />
Conservative 41, 46, 9<br />
Reform   29, 47, 20</p>
<p>Here is a little tidbit- only 76% of Ultra-Orthodox avoid  handling money on  Sabbath</p>
<p>Here is another good tidbit when asked whether they attend a non-Jewish  religious services at least few times a year, both Modern and ultra Orthodox have 15% that do, but with note that it is negligible in high density area like Brooklyn. So it is much higher than 15 % in small towns.</p>
<p>Should Homosexuality be accepted? Ultra-Orthodox 20%  Modern Orthodox 50%. On one hand, this is a divide between the two groups but at the same time a dividing point in the modern camp.</p>
<p>How many went to college? Ultra-Orthodox  25 Modern   65 Conservative   62 Reform 61. Modern Orthodoxy is the highest but in line with the other denominations.</p>
<p>But the biggest and most significant question is do you have  household  income of  $150,000+, placing you in the top 8%. Ultra-Orthodox  24, Modern 37, Conservative   23, Reform 2 9. Modern Orthodoxy is the wealthiest and living in a disproportionate bubble that is wealthier than Reform.</p>
<p>The demographic of Ultra-Orthodox yields only a 4.1 live birth number and if you remove those who leave Orthodoxy and those who die or never produce children, then we have a rough statistic that a statistical couple would only produce three ultra-Orthodox offspring. A far cry from the false numbers in the kiruv literature.</p>
<p>Finally, the Reform movement is growing and the Conservative movement is shrinking rapidly.  But the Forward received a wise email from Prof. Sarna.</p>
<blockquote><p>For Jonathan Sarna, a professor of Jewish studies at Brandies University who also advised the Pew study, the grim statistics facing the Conservative movement could be good for its members. Comparing the movement’s situation to that of the Orthodox movement in the 1950s and the Reform movement in the ’30s, relative lulls preceding large growth, Sarna said that the apparent collapse could force the movement into creative reinvention. It would be “wise to hedge all predictions,”</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>This blog celebrated its fourth anniversary this past week during hol ha-moed. &nbsp;Last year, I forgot to notice the third year milestone. </p>
<p>Over this time the posts have gotten longer and more like articles than short posts. People print and read them as articles. Or they note them and get to them a week or two later. </p>
<p>The original content was to reflect the tension between philosophy and lived religion, hence the title taken from Saadyah was to reflect the tension of philosophy –which Saadyah calls Emunot, things we cognitively accept&#8211; and the world of actual lived religion with its sects, personal opinions, and cultural forms- which he calls Deot, things based on character and predilection.</p>
<p>I did less philosophy this year because the discussions and papers about Torah min Hashamayim took a lion’s share of time.&nbsp; These posts got the blog included on a list of the <a href="http://peterkirby.com/top-50-biblioblogs-by-traffic.html">top fifty blogs on the Bible.</a> I also did less interfaith and parallels to Christianity because the general online world is more aware of the similarities of the Jewish and American Christian world and more aware of how much interfaith encounter, exchange, and discussion goes on even in Orthodoxy, but without the word dialogue. &nbsp;We had a long run on popular culture and Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>I do not post as much on the current religious recession. Even outreach professional have mainly lost their millenarian triumphalism and are acknowledging the loss and fallout from religion, as well as recognizing how much the community let its image be tarnished.</p>
<p>Currently, my main big project is a book on the <em>Varieties of Modern Orthodoxy 1780-2000,</em> which I hope to shop for publishers in 2015 and publish in 2017. It is on theology and not social history, institutional history, or polemics. It will be based on my 2005 YU course available here- <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4brqh">tinyurl.com/4brqh</a> The project has grow much larger than the original course and I have modified the dozen categories in a more narrative approach. I have some other project that I am working on that I will post by the end of Oct.  </p>
<p>Those academics and clergy that want an interview about your books or a guest post, then please let me know. I would be glad to oblige qualified people. Please don’t be shy. Everyone has enjoyed the process.</p>
<p>Thank you for your readership. However, if you want to comment, your comment must actually reflect that you needed to read the post to make the comment and you must be a reader of academic works. If that violates your opinion of the world, then this is not the place to hang out. &nbsp;(Please see the rules for comments.) And because of unscrupulous people, I cannot accept untraceable comments anymore.&nbsp; I need a real email that can be verified with a fixed IP address (no malinator). I really dont want to have to install a sign-up for comments. </p>
<p>Also dont forget to buy, or have your institution buy, my two recent books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judaism-Other-Religions-Models-Understanding/dp/0230622267/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Judaism and Other Religions;</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Judaism-World-Religions-Encountering-Christianity/dp/0230103693/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1">Judaism and World Religion.</a> or <a href="../../../../about/index.html">directly from me.</a></p>

				<p>A group of  religious-Zionist Bnei Akiva youth started organized prayers on behalf of Syrian civilians who are at risk due to the ongoing civil war in their country. The prayer initiative, which began with the Bnei Akiva volunteers who are doing a year of national civilian service in Petach Tikva, has now spread.  . </p>
<p>While Judaism teaches that any individual can pray to God and be heard, prayers said together as a group can have special power. The young volunteers also wished to have a formal prayer to say, in order to ask for divine mercy with the best possible wording.</p>
<p>They asked Rabbi Yuval Cherlow, a leading figure in the religious-Zionist world and the head of the Petach Tikva hesder yeshiva, to help them find the ideal wording for their request for divine assistance for Syrian civilians.</p>
<p>Rabbi Cherlow suggested that Psalm 37 and Psalm 120 would be particularly appropriate for the occasion. Both psalms speak of the plight of the innocent righteous when evil men plot against them. </p>
<p>Rabbi Cherlow also wrote his own prayer, which is beautifully translated by Elli Sacks of Modi&#8217;in (be sure to give Sacks credit). <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4423488,00.html">Here is the original Hebrew.</a> <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/171384#.Uh9V3dKsiSo">Read in English about story here.</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Master of the universe, who makes peace on high</p>
<p>Though we are not accustomed to new formal prayers, we can no longer look at the slaughter taking place in Your world and fail to pray about it. Though we know that both sides in the war are guilty of wanton bloodshed, we are unable to keep silent when so many who are beyond the circle of conflict have fallen victim.</p>
<p>We beseech You in prayer to arouse in the killers their basic humanity and evoke mercy in their hearts, that they may recognize that we are all created in the image of God, and that there are limits even to human cruelty. May You bring to pass what is written in Your Torah: &#8220;He who sheds the blood of man, by man his blood shall be shed, for in God&#8217;s image was man created.&#8221; </p>
<p>Grant us the wisdom to know how to act in this hour of distress, when the dark face of humanity&#8217;s evil inclination is once again fully exposed and we are unsure how to stand against it. Enable us to act with all our energies to prevent bloodshed in Your world, above all in the Holy Land and its environs, as it is written in Your Torah: &#8220;You shall not pollute the land where you are for blood pollutes the land; and the land will not expiate the blood shed upon it, but with the blood of he that shed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>May God who makes peace on high, make peace upon us and upon all Israel, and let us say amen.</p></blockquote>

				<p>In honor of the 50th anniversary of the &#8220;I have a dream speech,&#8221; here are selections from an unpublished BA thesis on the role of Orthodox Jews, Orthodox Rabbis, and YU students in the Civil Rights movement.It is not exhaustive because there were other Orthodox Rabbis such as Danny Landes of Pardes who spent the night in jail. </p>
<p><strong>“Justice, Justice You Will Pursue?” Orthodox Jewry and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1970</strong><br />
A Thesis Presented  By Lora Rabin Dagi, Bachelor of Arts with Honors, Harvard University, March 2006</p>
<p>On March 21, 1965, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led thousands of marchers from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in a political move that would ultimately lead to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Though Rabbi Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel’s presence at the front of the crowd has graced photographs of the event ever since, the story of Rabbi Saul Berman’s imprisonment in a Selma jailhouse just days before seems to have drawn a smaller audience. </p>
<p>Rabbi Berman was arrested on the Jewish fast day of Ta’anit Esther, which fell that year on March 17.  At nightfall, when the fast ended, Rabbi Berman was not able to break his fast on prison food, for it did not meet traditional Jewish dietary restrictions; a friend rummaged through Rabbi Berman’s suitcase and brought back the salami upon which Rabbi Berman was hoping to break fast. This friend also found another cylindrical item in the suitcase – a scroll containing the text of Megillat Esther, the tale of a Jewish girl who became queen of a massive kingdom and saved her people from certain destruction. Both the salami and the Megillat Esther proved to be of great use to Rabbi Berman: having broken the fast, Rabbi Berman celebrated Purim, a holiday commemorating the story of Megillat Esther, by reading the scroll out loud to “about 250 people” crowded into the jail.  One can imagine the power reverberating throughout the room as a young Orthodox rabbi, far from his congregation, read an ancient narrative recounting the deeds of a Jewish queen who saved her people from an enemy within the government – a story that could easily resonate with a group of people hoping to save blacks from their own government’s voter registration prejudices.  </p>
<p>Just two years before, rabbinical degree in hand, Rabbi Berman arrived in Berkeley, California ready to work at Congregation Beth Israel. For the five years he served there, Rabbi Berman worked to better the rights of blacks in Berkeley and beyond.  He returned to Berkeley after the 1965 Selma-Montgomery March determined to become more engaged with local civil rights politics. Though Berkeley’s high school was integrated, its lower education public school district lines were drawn in a way that separated white and non-white students. According to Rabbi Berman, two opposing forces were at work at once: one group wished to redraw the school lines so as to integrate the lower schools, while another group hoped to create a second high school that would essentially keep students segregated. Rabbi Berman primarily toiled to integrate the schools, though the community agenda additionally dealt with issues of free speech and, ultimately, the Vietnam War.  </p>
<p>Rabbi Berman’s case, though not the norm for the majority of Orthodox Jews in America, is by no means unique. Rabbis and some Orthodox laymen throughout the United States of America not only endorsed the Civil Rights Movement, but also worked to end racism against blacks </p>
<p>Rabbi Berman’s colleague in New York, Rabbi Irving (Yitz) Greenberg, also contributed to the Civil Rights Movement. Along with his wife, Rabbi Greenberg first supported the Movement through donations to “various civil rights groups and voting for candidates that were sympathetic to the [Movement];” soon, the two were “attending rallies or special demonstrations” for the improvement of the status of blacks in American society.  As a faculty member at Yeshiva University, a Modern Orthodox institution in New York City, Rabbi Greenberg took the opportunity to bring in speakers who discussed various aspects of the Civil Rights Movement. As a rabbi of the Riverdale Jewish Center, an Orthodox congregation, Rabbi Greenberg “spoke passionately” about the Movement’s necessity.  </p>
<p>Finally, Rabbi Greenberg involved himself in HaTza’ad HaRishon, a controversial and ultimately unsuccessful group founded for the benefit of so-called black Jews. Certain American communities of blacks were presenting themselves as Jews,  though the Orthodox community did not accept them as such. For instance, the Commandment Keepers Congregation of the Living God, based in Harlem, NY, identified itself as a sect of Judaism, though petition for institutional acceptance failed.  Established in 1964, HaTza’ad HaRishon, or “The First Step,” hoped “to serve the Jewish social, cultural, and educational needs of New York’s Israelites, to unify their communities, and to integrate Black Jews into…mainstream” Judaism.  It funded and organized social gatherings, Israeli dancing, “activities with other [white] Jewish youth groups,” prayer events, financial aid and placement in Jewish schools, educational discussion-based seminars, and edifying liaisons to white Jews who would discuss the existence of black Jewish communities.  In addition, the group provided access to Orthodox conversion resources, should its members desire to ensure their full acceptance by all parts of the Jewish community.  Ultimately, between incredibly charged questions of Jewish legitimacy, authority, and conversion, this group collapsed.  HaTza’ad HaRishon, though not the norm, represents both the race-blind aspect of Jewish conversion, and the fact that at least some Orthodox Jews did not view blacks through the lens of ‘absolute other.’ </p>
<p>In New York, Rabbi Greenberg was joined by the young Tsvi Blanchard, not yet a rabbi. Rabbi Blanchard was heavily involved by the late 1950s, and continued to take part in the Movement until the year after the 1965 Selma-Montgomery March. Splitting his time between college and yeshiva (a traditional Jewish institution of learning) in St. Louis, Rabbi Blanchard worked hard in Missouri and around his home in Rochester, New York to further the Movement’s goals. In St. Louis, he “was involved in redeveloping areas of the black ghetto.” In addition, Rabbi Blanchard participated in the boycotting and picketing of Woolworth’s and Eastman Kodak.  The Woolworth’s story is fairly well known: in 1960, four black students started a sit-in at a Greensboro Woolworth’s to protest segregated seating; within weeks, the “Greensboro four” had inspired sit-ins and picketings across the country.  In contrast, the Eastman Kodak narrative dealt with employment issues: Rabbi Blanchard joined Saul Alinsky, community organizer extraordinaire, to challenge Rochester’s Eastman Kodak to hire more black workers.  At the same time, Rabbi Blanchard involved himself in “a whole series of various and sundry picketings of racist speakers,” and supported “black self-organization efforts” such as those surrounding the Kodak protest.  The Selma-Montgomery March both highlights and marks the final stage of Rabbi Blanchard’s activity in this paper’s time period.</p>
<p>Even the South, homeland of the Jim Crow laws and their overt supporters, hosted at least two Orthodox rabbis who quietly worked to promote the message of the Civil Rights Movement. One rabbi from Atlanta chooses to remain anonymous, but writes that he participated casually throughout the time period; for instance, he would occasionally deliver sermons supportive of the Movement.   At times he would host observant Jewish activists who had recently been released from jails in Atlanta, Birmingham, Montgomery and elsewhere. Finally, this rabbi took part in “informal discussion groups” on the matter.  Another Southern rabbi, Rabbi Louis Tuchman of Durham, North Carolina, followed a similar pattern. Though his congregation hired him specifically because he was not a Civil Rights activist, Rabbi Tuchman was preaching pro-integration by 1957. He specifically incorporated the themes of freedom during the Jewish Purim and Hannukah holidays, relating the holidays to the black quest for full integration. Unfortunately for Rabbi Tuchman, that same year his congregation moved to the suburbs and to Conservative Judaism.  </p>
<p>Rabbi Tuchman and his anonymous colleague in Atlanta deserve special recognition for their work. According to Mark Bauman, fewer than forty Orthodox rabbis served congregations in the South in 1954. The states of “Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Mississippi…claimed a total of three Orthodox rabbis,” and no Orthodox rabbis served Florida communities apart from those in Miami and Miami Beach.  Bauman posits that the “limited” involvement of Orthodox rabbis in the South corresponds to the small number of Orthodox rabbis actually present.  This theory relies upon only one incidence of Orthodox involvement noted in his book’s collection; however, one cannot ignore the fact that some forms of informal involvement may prove quite difficult to trace. For instance, more than one or two Orthodox rabbis may have presented this controversial topic to their congregants through holiday sermons. Since participation in the Civil Rights Movement can include actions outside of a certain model of 1960s volunteering,  the judgment of ‘limited’ involvement may be based upon somewhat incomplete evidence. </p>
<p>Some, such as Chicago’s Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik, were better known; this leading Orthodox scholar passionately discussed the basis for equality in halakhah in the keynote address at a national convention for Orthodox affiliate Young Israel.<br />
By 1964, supposedly motivated by competition for “allegiance of the young” liberals flocking to Conservative and Reform denominations, the Rabbinical Council of America publicly declared its support for the Civil Rights Movement.  Young Israel, another Orthodox group, had already backed the Movement in a 1962 editorial.  The Orthodox Union, in turn, preceded Young Israel by agreeing with a “strongly liberal” plan for “civil rights and civil liberties” in the 1950s, and it continued to support the “civil rights gains of blacks” throughout the 1960s. </p>
<p><strong>Yeshiva University Students: The Civil Rights Movement and Other Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Without question, YU students actively discussed the Civil Rights Movement, though not necessarily right away. The record for the 1950s is largely silent on the matter, and aside from late-night dorm-room conversations  and a short editorial despairing over the bigotry extant at the University of Alabama,  there may not have been much debate over the plight of blacks in America. However, analysis of student publications shows that by the beginning of the 1960s, students often discussed and educated themselves about the Movement. For instance, in 1961, Stern students listened to a Nigerian leader maintain the need for blacks and whites to work together.  They later had the opportunity to hear the administrative assistant of the NAACP’s Executive Secretary speak about the history, purpose, methods, and goals of that prominent organization.  In 1964, the YC Yavneh, an “Orthodox Jewish students organization,”  hosted a panel on the Civil Rights Movement.  </p>
<p>An entire supplementary edition of The Observer was dedicated to questions on the causes of black rioting, theoretical solutions to help alleviate racial tension, comparisons between blacks and Jews in the United States, and comparisons between blacks and Israeli-Arabs.  In fact, from 1967 onwards, black rioting and episodes of black anti-Semitism clearly affected the rhetoric on campus. Musing over the previous summer’s black riots, one YC student wondered whether there was any possibility of calming the revolts.   The editor of HaMevaser, the “official student publication of the religious divisions” of YU, acknowledged that SNCC had rejected Jews,  yet felt that “a true religious person” could not blame all blacks for the actions of SNCC and its partners.  Another Observer supplementary edition addressed issues of Black Power, Jewish racism, Jewish withdrawal from the black-Jewish dialogue, and black anti-Semitism.  That same month, the grassroots campus publication Pulse published an author who was discouraged with the fact that black rioting and anti-Semitism had led some Jews to equate the push for black equality with extreme violence and fear, and thus to unsettling memories of the Holocaust. Rather than step away from American black society, this author hoped to encourage interracial discourse and the dissolution of negative black stereotypes among Jews.  Still another student, disgusted with the turn of events, claimed that the Civil Rights Movement had generated a “Frankenstein” of violent militants. </p>
<p>YU students did not simply discuss the Civil Rights Movement; they also actively pursued its goals. For example, in 1960, YU was a member of the Metropolitan Students for Non-Violent Civil Rights Action, and YU students protested Woolworth’s Southern lunch counter policies by picketing and distributing leaflets in front of a New York branch.   The next year, YU students started a tutoring program in a local public school; this program served as a model for other colleges.  One wholeheartedly dedicated Stern student published her memoirs of the March on Washington, where Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech; she later reported on a Washington, D.C. conference on apartheid, Southern segregation, and Northern discrimination.  This student soon worked with other Yavneh leaders to organize a “mass boycott of New York City public schools,” in which Yavneh members taught freedom schools and picketed throughout Harlem and Washington Heights.  In fact, YU even donated the use of one of its buildings for the endeavor.  By the late 1960s, over 100 YC students were tutoring through the Yeshiva University Neighborhood Youth Corps (YUNYC),  and SC started its own version of the same.  </p>
<p>YU as an institution encouraged a positive perspective on the Civil Rights Movement. In 1961, it awarded an “honorary Doctor of Laws degree” to Chief Justice Earl Warren,  who was quite influential in the 1954 vote to end segregation.  </p>
<p>In addition, its medical school application did not ask for a photograph, and thus had color-blind admissions.  This fact is noteworthy in a country whose medical schools were not fully open to blacks until 1966.  Starting in 1969, the medical school’s King-Kennedy Medical Program subsidized lower-income blacks as they prepared their pre-medical curriculum, so that they could later improve medical care in their ghetto communities.  That same year, a black Jewish YC freshman discussed his identity in The Commentator; clearly, a black Jewish student in the College was not only tolerated, but openly accepted.<br />
Though the institution seems to have acknowledged certain values of the Civil Rights Movement, a vocal group also begged its contemporaries to work with caution. For instance, one student responding to the Woolworth’s protest unashamedly critiqued the Student Council for officially backing the picketing: because of this backing, the Student Council had turned YU students into unwilling representatives of all East-coast Jews.  Rabbi Lichtenstein, a major figure in the school, felt that Orthodoxy’s slow response to issues such as the Civil Rights Movement was due to an appropriate sense of prudence;  still others felt YU could not afford to critique society publicly when it was just proving the possibility of living religiously and functioning fully within America.  </p>
<p>Yet another group of students may not have formulated extensive opinions on the Civil Rights Movement at all. Throughout the timeframe, The Commentator and The Observer published articles scorning the supposedly commonplace apathetic student lifestyle. Whether deriding the student body for voting half-heartedly, if at all, in the Student Council elections,  or simply condemning students for displaying “indifference” towards non-academic activities,  student leaders at SC and YC despaired over the seemingly “contagious” apathy displayed by their classmates.  This laziness does not necessarily point to an entire generation of bookworms. </p>
<p>In May of 1961, The Observer reported that nearly half the graduating class was already married, and two women had already borne children.  Interest in femininity encouraged the young women to bring a special instructor on “posture, hair care, make-up, and fashion” to the school three times during the 1963 to 1964 school year.   </p>

				<p>People seemed to like the <a href="../../../../2013/08/24/jewish-sufi-dervishes-1922/index.html">Jewish- Derwish photo from 1922</a> but there is much more Jewish-Sufism out there, even beyond Bahye or Avraham b. Maimonides. The scholarship for the last half century on the family of Moses Maimonides has produced a new shelf of books in halakhah, letters, exegesis, and Sufism. And we have works by those who followed them or asked them questions. Those who published the material are publishing the texts for the first time from manuscript and are dedicated to editing other manuscripts. Currently, there is no synthetic work bringing all this data together in order to provide a narrative of the 250 years of Egyptian Jewish intellectual life after Maimonides. </p>
<p>Here is a text David ben Joshua Maimonides or ibn Maimoni, that would be 1) Maimonides 2) son- Abraham (Nagid) 3) 3rd generationDavid (Nagid), Obadia (The Treatise of the Pool) 4) 4th generation Abraham 5) fifth generation Moshe (Nagid),Joshua (Nagid), and finally 6) six generation David (Nagid) 14th-15th century). </p>
<p>David (b. ~1335), succeeded his father Joshua Nagid of the Egyptian community in 1355, being the last of the Maimonidean dynasty to have held this office. David left Egypt and took up residence in Syria for a number of years (ca. 1375-1386), in the cities of Aleppo and Damascus. During this period he continued, however, to be known and revered as “David ha-Nagid, head of the Yeshivah.”Nagid David’s wrote a commentary on his great great grandfather Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah in Judeo-Arabic. “The commentary is preceded by two laudatory poems in honor of Ibn Sina and another celebrating the virtues of Awhad al-Zaman (al-Baghdadi).” </p>
<p>Nagid David’s<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/murshid-ila-al-tafarud-va-al-murfid-ila-al-tagarud/oclc/20519896&amp;referer=brief_results"><em> Al-Murshid ila al-Tafarrud wa-l-Murfid ila al-Tajarrud</em>, was translated by Fenton into Hebrew as <em>Maqalat fi derek ha’Chasidut</em>,</a> and <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/deux-traites-de-mystique-juive-obadyah-b-abraham-b-moise-maimonide-le-traite-du-puits-al-maqala-al-hawdiyya-david-b-josue-dernier-des-maimonide-le-guide-du-detachement-al-mursid-ila-t-tafarrud/oclc/20874780&amp;referer=brief_results">also into French.</a> The work guides the individual through the“spiritual stations to the exalted plane of Chasidut;” “it is the spiritual itinerary of the devotee which culminates in prophetical gnosis.” This work, Fenton explains, is “thoroughly imbued with Sufi ideology and terminology.” Finally, we see amongst the vast library of works attribute to Nagid David, that the work of Ibn al-`Arif (1088 – 1141) is cited as part of the collection of his copyings. In the Cairo Geniza shows from the numerous copies the famous Sufi Al-Hallaj (c. 858 – 922) and the writings of ibn al Arabi. A Genizah letter addressed and answered by Nagid David tells of Jews attending the meditation and zhikr (Heb: hazkarah) retreats of Sufi Shaykh Yusuf al-`Ajami al-Qurani (d. 1367), who supervised a zawiya hermitage on the Qarafa as-sugra Muslim cemetery east of Cairo. For more, see Fenton, Paul B.. &#8220;The Literary Legacy of David ben Joshua, Last of the Maimonidean Negadim.&#8221; The Jewish Quarterly Review 75, 1 (1984): 1-56.</p>
<p>Now here is a quote from Nagid David when he developed a Jewish-Sufi version of Suhrawardi’s concept of illumination through luminous intuitions, divine sparks, and mental flashes. This state is attained through constant contemplation, intense remembrance of God, and diminution of food and sleep. Thereupon, these lights shine upon his pure heart and an irradiance awakens  an inner desire to receive this divine blaze and angelic flashes. For more on Persian mystic Suhrawardi (1151-1191)- see <a href="http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H031.htm">a website dedicated to him here,</a> and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suhrawardi/#Met">Stanford E of P here </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab_al-Din_Suhrawardi">wiki here.</a> And for those looking for Tishrei <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Shape-Light-Hayakal-al-Nur/dp/1887752153/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y">reading- here.</a> We dont have a photograph of Nagid David in his Dervish clothes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the first station [of the spiritual path] which is that of illumination (zehîrût).</p>
<p>The Hebrew term zehîrût (‘meticulousness’) can have two meanings. Firstly, it can signify ‘scrupulousness’, through striving to reach the goal by deploying painstaking efforts or by abandoning thoughtlessness and renouncing a life of leisure.<br />
Secondly, it can signify ‘enlightenment’ as in the expressions of brightness (zôhar) in the verses ‘The Enlightened will  shine as brightness of the firmament’ (Dan. 12:3), and ‘brightness as the colour of amber’ (Ezek. 8:2). Hence the term zehîrût designates illumination and the individual who reaches this station is called zâhîr or ‘illuminate’. The latter refers to the seeker of the soul’s enlightenment and the spirit’s illumination through luminous intuitions, divine sparks, and mental flashes. </p>
<p>This [state] comes about through constant contemplation of the angelic world, intense remembrance of God, subtle meditation of the world of sanctity, and diminution of food and sleep. Thereupon, these lights shine upon his pure heart in accordance with his progress through the successive stages and stations, each more noble and exalted than its predecessor.<br />
For spiritual effort and illumination lead to further enlightenment  and irradiance, awakening an inner desire to receive this holy effulgence, divine blaze and angelic flashes, and inciting the individual to prepare himself for their encounter. Each arousal is conducive to illumination and each illumination is conducive to further arousal. On this account our Sages stated: ‘illumination leads to zeal’ (TB ‘Abodâh Zârâh 20b), i.e. this station is conducive to the following one.</p>
<p>Commentary<br />
The present text is a translation from the Judaeo-Arabic work al-Murshid ila t-tajarrud or ‘Guide to Detachment’ by David b. Joshua Maimonides (Egypt circa 1335-1410), last known nagîd (community leader) belonging to the famous Maimonides’ dynasty. The Guide to Detachment is a practical manual for the spiritual life divided into progressive stages based on the Talmudic dictum by R. Phineas b. Ya’ir : “Study leads to meticulousness, meticulousness leads to zeal, zeal leads to cleanliness, cleanliness leads to restraint, restraint leads to purity, purity leads to holiness, holiness leads to meekness, meekness leads to fear of sin, fear of sin leads to saintliness, saintliness leads to the holy spirit, the holy spirit leads to life eternal. Saintliness is the greatest of all of these” (TB ‘Abôdâh Zârâh 20b). The author construes these principles as the stages of the spiritual path or ladder of ascension similar to those found in Sufi manuals. </p>
<p>In this opening chapter, he specifies the prerequisites necessary to embarking upon the spiritual path. Having already discussed the initial prerequisite of knowledge, for ‘the ignorant cannot be pious’ (Aboth 2, 6), David Maimonides presents a very original interpretation of the term zehîrût (‘meticulousness’). In addition to its classical meaning of the ‘attentiveness’ which stems from knowledge, he lends it the sense of ‘enlightenment’. Interestingly, he uses as a locus probans the verse used in the opening passage of the Zohar, of ‘Book of Brightness’! However, David’s inspiration here is not Kabbalistic but Sufic, ultimately deriving from the ishrâqî or ‘illuminative’ spirituality of Suhrawardi (executed in 1191), for whom progress in speculative knowledge and spiritual illumination are intimately bound. Thus the starting point of spiritual awareness is a spark, an illumination which serves as a catalyser for the quest. This spark results from a meditative attitude – ‘constant contemplation of the angelic world’, ‘intense remembrance of God’, ‘subtle meditation of the world of sanctity’, – coupled with a corporeal discipline involving the reducing of one’s physical needs such as food and sleep. </p></blockquote>
