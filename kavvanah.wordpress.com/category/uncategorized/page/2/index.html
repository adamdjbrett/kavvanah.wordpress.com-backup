<p>Aryeh Kaplan’s <em>Handbook of Jewish Thought</em> has become a classic of synthesizing the classic positions of Jewish thought into an order fashion both an introductory guide and simultaneously a reference book </p>



<p>Below is a pdf of a full chapter of Aryeh Kaplan’s <em>Handbook of Jewish Thought</em> left out of the published work because he presents evolution as part of the basic tenets of Judaism. The already typeset chapter has an editor’s note across the top asking if the chapter is “fixable” and “true kosher”? There is also an editor’s note that dates the chapter to 1968 when Kaplan was leading a Conservative congregation in Dover NJ.</p>



<p>The <em>Handbook of Jewish Thought</em> was published in
two volumes, the first, containing 13 chapters, appeared in the author’s
lifetime in 1979. The second volume edited by Avraham Sutton, was published
posthumously in 1992. This volume has 25 chapters. While the first volume had
no introduction from the author, the second volume contains the following
statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The bulk of the present volume is from the author’s original 1967- 1969 manuscript that consisted of 40 chapters. Thirteen of these chapters were prepared for publication by Rabbi&nbsp; Kaplan himself and published in 1979 as the <em>Handbook of Jewish thought – Volume I</em>. It is clear that the remaining chapters were set aside with the thought of eventually preparing them for publication. Of these remaining chapters, 25 are presented here</p></blockquote>



<p>Despite the assertion that the first volume was called
“volume 1”, no such statement is to be found in the original <em>Handbook of
Jewish thought</em>. </p>



<p>Quick arithmetic – 13 (volume 1) and 25 (volume 2) indicates that 2 chapters of the original 40 were suppressed. In the end, they &#8211; Moznayim – or the Kaplan family concluded to leave these chapters out of the book.  Generally, the works published by Moznayim are much more circumspect than the audio recording of his lectures. Here is an extreme case. </p>



<p>Moznayim assigned people to edit Kaplan’s writings &nbsp;or tapes of his lectures who were not there at
the lectures or had left for other teachers years before. </p>



<p>I thank Rabbi Ari Kahn for providing access by sending
me the pdf of this gem. If someone has the final – 40<sup>th</sup> chapter – I
would love to see it.</p>



<p><strong>Evolution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>Kaplan is explicit in his affirmation of evolution in
this piece. </p>



<p>In the first three paragraphs, he states that the creation
account in Genesis is not literal and not science but narrated to teach the
history of Israel. He believes that new concepts in science are always being
discovered beyond the limited science known in the Biblical and rabbinical era.
&nbsp;We are, according to Kaplan, to continuously
interpret the Biblical text according to currently available knowledge. </p>



<p>Even though the explicit text is to narrate Israel’s history, nevertheless Kaplan states that the scientific knowledge is hinted at in the Masoretic text through “subtle variations”. In addition, we have traditions that aid in our discovering the scientific truth in the text. Maimonides and other medieval commentators interpreted the text based on Aristotle. Maimonides in his Guide II:29 explains how he would be willing to read texts based on current science. Similarly, Kaplan footnotes Ramchal in his commentary of the Aggadot. </p>



<p>Kaplan considers the creation of the universe as billions of years ago when there was the initial creation as the creation of matter as well as the initial creation of time/space. The creation at the start of Genesis was billions of years ago according to Kaplan, even if the Torah does not explicitly state it. </p>



<p>Kaplan explicitly rejects the 19<sup>th</sup> century Gosse
theory, a theory that the world only appears to be older because God created it
that way. Kaplan writes: “God does not mislead humans by making the world
appear older.” Many of the members of the Association of Orthodox Scientists of
his era did accept Gosse as did the Lubavitcher Rebbe. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaplan defines the creation with the date of 3761 BCE as only the date when Adam (the new being with intelligence) was created. The world itself is billions of years old and various species of men, including Neanderthals  and Homo Erectus, pre-date this created Adam.  People generally assume the creation of the world, creation of men, and creation of the intelligent descendants of Adam occurred at the same time; Kaplan differentiates these events. </p>

<p>The metaphoric sixth day was only when Adam was created in Divine thought as the plan for creation, not the actual date of his creation- see below on Kaplan&#8217;s acknowledging humanoids before Adam. (Berakhot 61b  Eruvin 18a)</p>



<p>Kaplan makes a general statement that the “time of creation is not essential to our thought.” He proves this from a citation in Yehuda Halevi’s  Kuzari,1:60-61” </p>



<p>Al Khazari: Does it not weaken thy belief if thou art told that the Indians have antiquities and buildings which they consider to be millions of years old?” To which the Rabbi in the dialogue answers: “The Rabbi: It would, indeed, weaken my belief had they a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found. Such a book, however, does not exist.” </p>



<p>Kaplan takes this to mean that Halevi would only be bothered if they had a form of religion accepted by the multitude with discrepancy, but not about the claim concerning civilization and ancient books. </p>



<p>Kaplan states that nature does not change so we accept radioactive dating; the method is valid to establish definitively that the world is billions of years old. In this, he rejects the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s opinion that radioactive dating is not valid because nature changes.  Kaplan has certainty that science works without caveats and if the method of radioactive dating of fossils show that they are millions of years old then they are millions of years old. They are not animals killed in the Biblical flood but creatures who lived billions of years ago.</p>



<p>In footnote number 12, Kaplan states that each of God’s years is 365,242 of ours yielding a world age of two billion years, which is not the current scientific age of 13.8 billions of years. </p>



<p>In contrast, in his later writings and talks, <a href="https://www.simpletoremember.com/faqs/Kaplan-SimpleToRemember.com.pdf">most notably his 1979 essay on evolution</a>, he comes up with a 15 billion year date for the universe based on Isaac the Blind, a date closer to the scientific view. For more on his later calculation, see Ari Kahn, <em>Explorations: In-depth Analysis of the Weekly Parashah Through the Prism</em> <em>of Rabbinic Perspective </em>(Brooklyn: Targum press, 2001).</p>



<p>In this early passage in the <em>Handbook</em> and its notes he does not cite Isaac of Acco. At this point, it seems he did not yet have a copy of Isaac of Acco or he might have had a citation but did not have the full sefer or did not fully study it yet. Isaac’s <em>Sefer Meirat Eynayim</em> was not yet published; it was published in 1974. And Isaac’s important <em>Otzar Hayyim</em> still remains in manuscript. Kaplan write that he obtained the photocopy of the manuscript of <em>Otzar Hayyim </em>in the 1970&#8217;s circa 1976. If in 1968 he did not have the manuscript yet, and he only photocopied it after he started publicly teaching Kabbalahthen he might have been relying on an older work of scholarship that cited it. Alternately, he might have been creative enough to develop the Rashi on his own to reach 2 billion. (see footnote 12 below)  </p>



<p>Kaplan explains that God did not really verbalize in
the creation of the world, rather God speaks means the impression of will upon
matter thereby giving it a new property. God speech involves modulating
creation to desired results.&nbsp; (There is
already a sense here of Kaplan’s later focus on mental acts &#8211; meditation).
Kaplan in his spiritualizing of the text successfully manages to be deeply
Maimonidean and Nahmanidean at the same time. He can cite simultaneously
Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed on how locutions such as “God spoke”, “God’s
mouth” or “God spoke to Moses” are anthropomorphic and not to be taken
literally. Simultaneously, Kaplan appeals to Ramban 1:3 in that Divine will
impressed upon the primordial matter of <em>hiyuli</em>, God is not literally speaking
but engaged in the coming to be of the lower hypostatic element, which in turn
will create the world. Kaplan foreshadows his later thought and treats kabbalah
in a non-literal manner. </p>



<p>&nbsp;(In Castilian Kabbalistic language, this would
be keter affecting hokhmah. Later Orthodox attempts to harmonize Biblical
create and science used Ramban’s concept of primordial matter in a literal
manner as an allusion to the Big Bang theory). </p>



<p>Kaplan further spiritualizes the process so the steps
of creation did not happen at the stated time, just that the prerequisites for
God’s goal was complete even though the actual goal would not manifest until
later (15:8)</p>



<p>Kaplan explains the phrase “it was good” to mean the
completion of something essential for the evolution of the universe,
destruction of prior worlds means evolution to something higher. &nbsp;The world is evolving to higher stages. The
destruction of prior world does not mean there were prior worlds just that
lower forms of this world. (15:9) (He cites Maharal Beer Hagolah 39b)</p>



<p><strong>Days of Creation</strong></p>



<p>What was the light created on the first day before the
creation of planets? For Kaplan the light on the first day is the electromagnetic
force in matter responsible for all chemical and physical properties, without
the electromagnetic force the world is chaos and void. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What was created on the second day? It was when God
set the matter of the first day into Euclidean four-dimensional space-time
matrix. (15:12). </p>



<p>On the third day, God created the gravitational force.
The “gathering of the waters” is not about swamps and sea but the “warping of
matter” and the creation of phenomena that follow non-Euclidian geometry. It
was also the physio-chemical properties of matter needed for plant life, (15:13)</p>



<p>On the fourth day, God initiated the process by which
matter would condense into galaxies, starts and planets,” which is the
completion of inorganic matter. </p>



<p>On the fifth day, God started the process by which
organic matter and life came to be. </p>



<p>On the important 6<sup>th</sup> day of creation, God
created the evolutionary potential of higher mammals and primitive man. Nothing
was actually created on the 6<sup>th</sup> day, rather the evolutionary
potential of the development of higher mammals from lower mammals was
designated. After the 6<sup>th</sup> day, God allows world to develop by itself
– without intelligent design- solely through the natural evolution. Just as the
geological evolution of crystals grow naturally over millions of years from
natural processes, so too the evolution of animals is the same way. The
unfolding properties for mammals and eventually man is in the natural order. </p>



<p>Man, known to paleontologists as later stages of homo sapiens, already had mental and physical capabilities about 25,000 years ago according to Kaplan’s scheme. (In 1979, he extends this to 100,000 years ago).</p>



<p>However, it was only 6000 years that man was given a divine soul. This was a new level of wisdom and inventiveness to allow for cultural evolution through invention, metallurgy, animal husbandry, ship sailing (15:22). Actual  paleontologists  place this Chalcolithic period, the period of new wisdom, as between 11,000 to 6000 years ago. Kaplan acknowledges that species change and that even man evolves as shown by his vestigial tail. </p>



<p>Hence, the seven days of creation are as follows:</p>



<p>Day
1 Electromagnetic force </p>



<p>Day
2 4-D space/time matrix</p>



<p>Day
3 Warping of matter, beyond Euclidian space </p>



<p>Day
4 Inorganic matter</p>



<p>Day
5 Organic matter and life</p>



<p>Day
6 Evolutionary potential of higher mammals and primitive man.</p>



<p>Kaplan explains his own method of not treating the
words literally, rather as allegories for scientific principles. Water, sky,
and light are all allegorical terms for the unfolding of the scientific cosmos
because the scientific terms were unknown in ancient times. (15:10) As he wrote
earlier in the chapter, according to Maimonides the words used as not intrinsic
but subject to interpretation and according to Nahmanides, these terms refer to
divine unfolding of the cosmos not physical objects. </p>



<p>In
many ways, Kaplan approach to science is similar to Nahmanides’ concept of
remez, in which scientific concepts are alluded to in the Torah. Both Kaplan
and Nahmanides read the allusions in the Torah to science, psychology, and powers
of the soul. </p>



<p>Nahmanides in his introduction to the Torah wrote: “God informed Moses first of the manner of the creation of heaven and earth and all their hosts… together with an account of the four forces in the lower world, minerals, vegetation, animal, and the rational soul. With regard to all of these matters Moses our teacher was apprised, and all of it was written in the Torah, explicitly or by implication.” (For more about Nahmanides, see Oded, Yisraeli, The Kabbalistic Remez and Its Status in Naḥmanides’ Commentary on the Torah. <em>The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy</em>. 24. (2016)1-30)</p>

<p>Welcome back after the holidays. Before the holidays, we discussed the new book by Miriam Feldmann Kaye and had three responses from Levi Morrow, Zohar Atkins, and Claire R. Sufrin. </p>



<p>  The interview with&nbsp;<a href="../../../../2019/09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/index.html">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye- here,&nbsp;</a>the first response was by&nbsp;<a href="../../../../2019/09/19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/index.html">Levi Morrow- here</a>, the second was by<a href="../../../../2019/09/23/zohar-atkins-responds-to-miriam-feldmann-kaye/index.html"> Zohar Atkins- here</a> and the third was by <a href="../../../../2019/09/25/claire-e-sufrin-responds-to-miriam-feldman-kaye/index.html">Claire R. Sufrin-here.</a>In her final word to response, Feldmann Kaye seeks to disaffirm and negate their specific comments.</p>



<p>At the end of her response, Feldmann Kaye positively affirms that we are called again to respond to the “plentiful array of intersections beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. Profound responses to these deeply philosophical questions, are well on their way, and many more rest on the horizon.” Personally, I look forward to these imminent profound responses. </p>

<h2><strong>Miriam Feldmann Kaye – Response</strong></h2>



<p>Thank
you to Prof. Brill for hosting some of the critical questions of our times.
This blog pioneers contemporary Jewish thought, encouraging new Jewish
philosophical and literary knowledge and engagement. The nature of this
particular conversation reflects a heated discussion of the array of
intersections beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. These responses
partially epitomise the ambivalence towards the term ‘postmodernism’. Although,
expressions of this stance deserve to be addressed with a deeper,
content-based, and respectful nature, of critique.&nbsp; </p>



<p>What
is apparent in this discussion typifies religious approaches towards
cutting-edge theology. In a positive sense, it also exemplifies engagement with
these ideas. The particular focus here is on my book, and an analysis of the
theologies of Rav Shagar (Rabbi Shimon Gershon Rosenberg) and Professor Tamar
Ross, but it is about a far broader picture of engagement with postmodern
thinking, drawing on the wealth of writings of other Jewish thinkers. It is
about the ability of Jewish thinking to cope with, or amalgamate, ideas from
contemporary philosophy.</p>



<p>Before
I address each response, there are two points which I stated in the interview,
that I will emphasise to avoid some of the apparent confusion:</p>



<ol><li>It is not my purpose to champion or to defend postmodernism.  This seems to be an important point to state, and to set aside some confusion. This allows us, or should have allowed us, to go beyond the debate of who is for and against; who agrees and who disagrees; who affiliates and who does not. The book addresses the ways in which, and the extents to which, ideas in postmodern discourse, are integrated into new thinking on contemporary Jewish philosophy. This includes discussions of the limitations of postmodern discourse in propounding a robust Jewish theology for today’s age.</li><li>I continue to take care not to class any of the numerous thinkers I deal with, as proponents of ’postmodernism’’. Throughout the book, I analyse Prof Ross’ and Rav Shagar’s <em>ambivalence</em> towards issues that postmodernism raises. This is not a simple zero sum game and needs to be addressed in accordance to these fine distinctions. </li></ol>



<p>Connected
or unconnected to this, the first two presented responses potentially discard a
great opportunity for a public conversation on the deeper issues at stake. </p>



<p>The
first response, written by Levi Morrow, would have had many of his issues
answered in the previous interview, which it seems was only partially related
to, as illustrated in the following ways: </p>



<p>Morrow
critiques what is plainly a philosophical analysis of Rav Shagar, stating that
“there is something fundamentally strange about trying to identify Rav Shagar
with a given philosophical stream”. </p>



<p>However,
this is precisely the way in which Jewish philosophy has functioned and
flourished for centuries: Philo and his integration of Platonic and Socratic
philosophy; Rambam’s engagement with Aristotle; Maimon and Mendelssohn’s engagement
with Enlightenment ideas; Rosenzweig, Buber and Levinas’ engagement with
phenomenology and existentialism.</p>



<p>The
consideration of future Jewish thought becomes the natural task – and the
consideration of Rav Shagar and Prof Ross as amongst these thinkers, brings to
the fore the issues of today &#8211; including Hasidut, neo-pragmatism, Kabbalah,
phenomenology, semiotics and late twentieth-century hermeneutical trends. This
is hardly ‘’strange’’. </p>



<p>What
is strange is that he states
that my book, which deals with philosophical elements of Rav Shagar’s
philosophy presents a “depiction of Rav Shagar [which] cannot serve to introduce new
readers to his theology’’.
It in fact <em>does</em>
provide readers with philosophical insights into the thought of Rav Shagar.
This simplification seems to be based on a mistaken understanding of the book
as an introduction to Rav Shagar’s life. </p>



<p>Rav
Shagar is indeed recognised for his total commitment to and deep engagement
with the national-religious Yeshiva world, from Kerem B’Yavneh, Mekor Haim, to
Bet Morasha, to Siach as his intellectual ‘’home’’. His writing is steeped in
Torah learning, and, as his works are published, presents an ever-developing
search for the mystical interpretations of religious-Zionism of Rav Kook. </p>



<p>At
the same time, Rav Shagar was also a Jewish theologian, and I invite others to
recognize him as such. His home bookshelf attests to his readings of
Wittgenstein, Althusser and others, alongside R. Shneur Zalman of Lyady. In his
later years, he was comparing the thought of Rebbe Nahman of Bratzlav with
Derrida, Barthes and Lyotard. And so, I re-state that Rav Shagar was a
theologian addressing postmodern thought at the same time as his immersion in
the Yeshiva world – the same way in which philosophers over the course of
Jewish history have also been.&nbsp; </p>



<p>This
encounter between both worlds is an important part of this discourse in its
entirety. In this case, I analyse Rav Shagar’s Lamdanut through the lens of
phenomenology. Another example is that his interpretations of Hasidut, are
analysed within the framework of the philosophy of language. </p>



<p>Neither
Morrow, nor Atkins give hardly a mention to Prof. Ross, who is critical to the
discussion, at the very least in the way that Rav Shagar’s thinking is framed.
Readers might have expected at least one informed comment of Prof. Ross as
unique in her synthesised works on Rambam, and Rav Kook which simultaneously
address the meaning of religious language, and its epistemological
significance. Neither of the first two respondents take this crucial
comparative element into account &#8211; which ultimately suggests a misunderstanding
of the thematic nature of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Unfortunately,
Morrow’s response descends into nit-picking. He finds certain footnotes – of
which there are hundreds in the book – to be ‘’unhelpful’’ and another as
‘’frustrating’’ and another as ‘’insane’’. In addition to this sort of
language, he writes about the book as “misleading’’, and certain paragraphs
which are apparently ‘’lacking’’, and ‘’absent’’. </p>



<p>His
list of referencing publication dates is weakened by his statement that my
dissertation was, over a period of time, ‘’converted by the publisher’’. Is he
unaware, or taking away from the fact that I wrote the book? The content and
style of this critique could be understood as begging the question as to what
is really bothering him about the book.&nbsp; </p>



<p>However, he completes his response by lauding my ‘’visionary theology’’. He writes that this work is ‘’excellent’’ and ‘’constructive’’ which is ‘’deeply in tune with both Jewish mysticism and the power of religious language’’. He also recommends that book ‘’call[s] for us to do much the same’’. Given his erudite readings and initial work of the translations of Rav Shagar’s work, one might have expected him to offer a more respectful response. </p>



<p>The
second response was written by Atkins. In his comments he seems to be missing
elements of the subject that were explicated in the book, and the interview, which
I’ve re-stated above. </p>



<p>Atkins’
response begins with what seems to be a description of postmodernism which he
implies forms the main argument of both my interview and book. &nbsp;He then begins to critique postmodernism, and it
becomes apparent, that he is offering a metaphor for an engagement with
postmodernism, namely my own, with this sceptical critique. He blurs the
boundaries between his criticism of postmodernism and between my writing, wherein
it is implicit that the two are inseparable. </p>



<p>Atkins
considers my use of philosophers – including Derrida, Lacan, Irigaray – as superficial
‘’name-dropping’’ and ‘’miming authority’’ – comparing it to the listing of
names of women objectified in a degrading gangster sexualised rap song. This
inappropriate comparison raises the question as to what he is really
suggesting? Is the problem that philosophers are listed together as
representative of philosophical movements? Or is he offering a critique of postmodern
literature? Or is he critiquing the ongoing misogyny in popular culture, and beyond?
This would have been an interesting, albeit, misplaced debate had it not been
for the derogatory tone – which continues far beyond this paragraph. His
response was then unsurprisingly censored by Prof Brill himself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In
a continued reading of his piece, he repeatedly implies that I am out to ‘’defend’’
postmodernism. One example of this is his critique of Derrida for whom, he
writes, “performance is the point, that there is nothing besides the rhetoric”.
Again, it is probably based on the presumption that the book is putting forward
an unapologetic defence of postmodernism. </p>



<p>He
further states that I am the ‘’expositor’’ of Prof. Ross and Rav Shagar. This
is mistaken, in the same way that a scholar of Rambam is not necessarily a
logician, and a researcher of Kierkegaard is not necessarily a Christian
existentialist. In addition to this, unexplained responses to a multifaceted
discipline are rife: “a tease’’ – with no explanation as to what this means
here; “none of the views espoused by Feldmann Kaye…”; and, ‘’none reflect a
deep phenomenological experience’’. These are simplifications of a far more
complex discourse. </p>



<p>His
call for a methodological deconstruction of postmodernism itself is engaging. I
might too have taken interest in his discussion on Heidegger and Derrida, had
he not made repeated
generalisations of my interview, making the starting point of the discussion
difficult to ascertain.</p>



<p>However, with all
of this, he is “grateful to Miriam Feldmann Kaye for introducing the question of
postmodernism into the contemporary discussion of Jewish thought and theology”.</p>



<p>In the meantime, since publication, both respondents have sent me private apologies.</p>



<p>The
third response was written by Claire R. Sufrin. It was, relatively, a more
thoughtful and engaging response &#8211; not just because it came across in a respectful
manner but because she offers important reflections. I note that she hadn’t
read my book though she does have the decency to say so.</p>



<p>In response to
Sufrin’s point on Prof. Ross as a forerunner in the religious feminist
movement, please see the introduction to my book where I determine her
ground-breaking work on feminism to be a case in point of her broader concerns
in philosophy of epistemology and revelation. </p>



<p>The
question of how new the subject, can first be answered of postmodernism as a
movement itself. In its various formations, it can be said to go back to the mid-twentieth
century, alongside, or offshoots of, and manifestations of, contemporaneous
trends. This is because postmodernism constitutes a discursive model of engagement,
way beyond &nbsp;philosophy and religion.</p>



<p>Postmodern
discourse is now appropriated in the fields of law, architecture, literature
and Political studies (even within Israel).&nbsp;
These fields engage with the questions of how far postmodern discourse
serves to reframe the very questions asked in these fields of study. Some of
the central perspectives offered by postmodernism comprise issues such as
non-binary and beyond binary theories of post-structuralism, post-colonialism,
aesthetics, gender theory as well as meta-ethics. In the realm of religion,
‘postmodern theology’ has been developed by Christian theologians for the last
two decades. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In
the introduction to my book, I suggest that the subject be approached
thematically, rather than by addressing totalised chronological movements of
‘’modernism’’ and ‘’postmodernism’’. What can be said though, is that we are at
the transition between modern and postmodern thought, reflecting the changes in
the trends with which we are surrounded. </p>



<p>I
am however intrigued by Sufrin’s question as to why the book is referred to as
new. I can think of at least ten thinkers, some based in Israel and some based
outside of Israel, who deal with aspects of postmodernism, who include Kepnes,
Handelman, Wolfson, Govrin and Ofrat. In addition to these thinkers, we also
now witness postmodern Jewish exegetical approaches to other aspects of
scholarship, such as of rabbinic literature, feminism, and so on. </p>



<p>As
a whole, we witness a glimpse into different approaches towards postmodern
ideas. We are called again to respond to the issues to hand, and to join the
substantive, heated discussion, about how Jewish thinkers respond to the
critical issues of our times – and to the plentiful array of intersections
beyond postmodern thinking and Jewish philosophy. Profound responses to these
deeply philosophical questions, are well on their way, and many more rest on
the horizon. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.clairesufrin.com/">Claire E. Sufrin</a> is Associate Professor of Instruction and Assistant Director of Jewish Studies at the Crown Family Center for Jewish and Israel Studies. Her research and teaching interests include modern&nbsp;Jewish thought, religion and literature, and American Judaism. </p>



<p>Sufrin thinks that we still need to confront Lyotard because he was observing something he observed. Her comments focus in several ways on why the Orthodox focus on &#8220;pluralism of multiple religious faiths&#8221; and not &#8220;the plurality within Judaism and Jewish thought&#8221;  In addition, why describe Feldmann Kaye as the first when there are antecedents? Finally, is the definition of postmodernism used by Feldmann-Kaye focused on an Israeli Orthodox  definition.  Sufrin&#8217;s substantive comment on the treatment of Tamar Ross is the role of legal theorist Robert Cover for Ross, rather than postmodernism.  </p>



<h2><strong>Claire E. Sufrin &#8211; Response</strong>  </h2>



<p>I want to start by thanking Professor Brill for inviting me to comment on his conversation with Miriam Feldmann Kaye. His invitation and then even more so the record of the Feldmann Kaye-Brill conversation led me to order a copy of her book and to wait for it with anticipation. (It is not yet in my university’s library system.) Alas, I am still waiting at the mailbox, and the original deadline I agreed upon with Brill has come and gone. So I offer what follows below with the caveat that I am responding to the interview as well as to the comments offered by my colleagues but that I have not yet read Feldmann Kaye’s book. As a result, I intend my contribution to this forum not to be a review of Feldmann Kaye’s work so much as a list of ideas and questions that I will bring to her text when it does finally arrive.</p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>I agree that with Zohar Atkins that the term post-modernism
is inherently slippery. Especially if it refers to a “mood” rather than a
distinct movement. I appreciate the genealogy Atkins has constructed of
skepticism and other distinguishing characteristics of post-modernism. </p>



<p>He is certainly right that Lyotard’s claim that
post-modernity is the end of grand-narratives is itself a grand narrative. But
I don’t think that that structural problem should distract us from Lyotard’s
claim. We need to read Lyotard as responding to and trying to describe a change
he was seeing in the world around him. This is true even if he was himself
still struggling to leave a modernist paradigm behind him.</p>



<p>Yet, Post-modernism was a small blip on the screen of
modernity, rather than a new screen altogether. My way of measuring this is
inelegant but still must reflect something: when I was an undergraduate in the
late 90s, the term post-modernism was everywhere. One of my friends joked at
one point that she needed to take a course on the western classics in her
senior year, given all the time she’d spent deconstructing those classics in
every other class up until then. And yet, when I survey the undergraduates I
teach, they rarely have heard the term post-modernism or the name Derrida. </p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism and Judaism</strong></p>



<p>What about post-modernism makes it threatening to Judaism?
If Lyotard’s definition is right—and I generally think that it is and find it
useful in my research and teaching—then postmodernism is threatening because
Judaism is built on a grand narrative. That’s easy enough. But which sort of
pluralism (another word for “no grand narrative is allowed to reign supreme”)
is more threatening—the pluralism of multiple religious faiths? Or the
plurality within Judaism and Jewish thought? </p>



<p>Another point that may or may not be related: why do the other blog posts treat Feldmann Kaye as the first Jewish thinker to wrestle with post-modernity when the subtitle of Eugene Borowitz’s <em>Renewing the Covenant </em>(published in 1991) is “A Theology for the Postmodern Jew.” Surely there are other examples as well.  [siteowner note- think of Marc Alain Ouaknin &amp; Michal Govrin as Orthodox examples of postmodernists]</p>



<p>Borowitz, of course, wrote as a liberal Jew, a leading
figure in the Reform Movement. Does Feldmann Kaye acknowledge his book? Can
post-modernism be a starting point for conversation between liberal and
traditional Jewish theologians? If not, why is Wittgenstein a more comfortable
conversation partner than Borowitz? </p>



<p>If Levi Morrow is right and the “postmodernism” that
Feldmann Kaye has in mind is liberal individualism (something I’d suggest we
should associate with modernism, not post-modernism) and “what comes
after and/or attacks the ideas of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and his son, Rabbi
Tzvi Yehudah Kook.” This is a definition specific to a community within
Orthodoxy. </p>



<p>If Morrow is right, there are a few questions I’d like ask:
first and foremost, what is the audience of this book? If it is other Orthodox
figures—perhaps Ross herself or followers of the now-deceased Shagar—then to
interrogate her use of the term “postmodernism” seems to miss the point.</p>



<p><strong>Tamar Ross and Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>Unlike the other reviewers, I know Tamar Ross’s work fairly
well and I have a deep appreciation for what she tries to do in <em>Expanding the Palace of Torah</em>, even as I
am not sure she is entirely successful. </p>



<p>To me, the heart of Ross’s work is not her use of
Wittgenstein or others I might label “postmodern.” Rather, the importance of
her work lies in two other places. </p>



<p>One is her claim that revelation is continually unfolding, a
claim she bases on her reading of Rav Kook and prior Kabbalists and Hasidic
thinkers.</p>



<p>The other important aspect of her work is her engagement
with feminism, with other feminist Jewish theologians such as Judith Plaskow
and Rachel Adler, and with Robert Cover’s legal theory. (Disclosure: I’ve
written about Cover as a source of feminist theology elsewhere.) There is a
real struggle in this book to find a way for feminism and Orthodoxy to somehow
make sense together. Like Adler, Ross takes feminist Jewish theology to the
next level of complexity and intellectual integrity, beyond earlier works by
Judith Plaskow and Blu Greenberg, which were more focused on disrupting the
status quo and highlighting the exclusion of women from Jewish history,
thought, and community (if not more).</p>



<p>Is Ross postmodern? It’s not a term I would have applied to her; if Morrow is correct about the definition that Feldmann Kaye is assuming, then it applies to her insofar as she is an interpreter of Kook. But what does that get us? Perhaps Feldman Kaye’s book is best understood as a book about Kook’s legacy; but that does not appear from the interview to be the way in which she understands it. I look forward to reading the text and deciding for myself. I am grateful already to Feldmann Kaye, however, for engaging with Ross and giving her work the attention it deserves. To all those who have participated in the formal conversation on this blog and in other fora such as Brill’s facebook page by saying “I have not read Ross but…” I hope that this will lead you to pick up her book and take its claims quite seriously.</p>

<p>This is the second response the interview with <a href="../../../../2019/09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/index.html">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye- here, </a>the first response was by <a href="../../../../2019/09/19/levi-morrow-response-to-miriam-feldmann-kayes-use-of-rav-shagar/index.html">Levi Morrow- here. </a></p>



<p>Rabbi Dr. Zohar Atkins  (<a href="https://www.thelehrhaus.com/author/zoharatkins/">here </a>and <a href="https://hartman.org.il/Faculty_View.asp?faculty_id=301&amp;Cat_Id=333&amp;Cat_Type=About">here</a>) is the founder of Etz Hasadeh and a Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America. He holds a DPhil in Theology from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and semikha from JTS. He is the author of a philosophic work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theological-Appropriation-Heideggers-Critique-Modernity/dp/3319969161">An Ethical and Theological Appropriation of Heidegger’s Critique of Modernity </a>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) and a book of poetry <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nineveh-Zohar-Atkins/dp/1784107395/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1569284600&amp;sr=1-1">Nineveh (Carcanet, 2019</a>). He is the author of a weekly d&#8217;var Torah newsletter: tinyletter.com/etzhasadeh</p>



<p><a href="http://kenissa.org/national-gatherings/national-consultations/2019-national-consultation/building-communities-2019/">His organization <em>Etz Hasadeh</em>&nbsp;</a> is both an emergent community oriented around the existential study of Jewish texts, philosophy, and poetry, and a lab for rethinking the field of Jewish education writ large. We promote the development of personalized, psychologically inflected, existential meaning-making skills. Etz Hasadeh offers an intervention in the way Tanakah and Rabbinic literature are taught and studied, clearing the way for a ​<em>poetic&nbsp;</em>​approach to learning that empowers students to engage ancient images and ideas as metaphors for the challenges of contemporary life.</p>



<p>In this response essay, Zohar Atkins has several points.
First, and easiest to grasp, is that the term postmodernism is difficult to
define and may ultimately be more of a mood than a theory. Second, and more
substantively, Torah is about continuity, tradition, mesorah, and grounded
readings, not skepticism and the limits of knowledge. Therefore, to Atkin’s ear
much of the discussion of consensus, self-acceptance, and progressive
revelation sound like 19<sup>th</sup> century opinions of the followers of Zechariah
Frankel. </p>



<p>Third, postmodernism is clearly not Existentialism,
and Franz Rosenzweig already rejected the early 20<sup>th</sup> century idea of
living “as if” as inauthentic. Fourth, he finds problems with Feldmann-Kaye’s
use of Heidegger who rejected humanism and instead sought an opening to truth,
an unconcealing of Being allowing us to think. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Atkins does try to explain the use of postmodernism as
a way of saying “God wants us to be incapable of finding God. Postmodernism is
just another name for&nbsp;<em>Galut Edom</em>, the Roman Exile.” Yet, he
concludes that: “these flights of poetic fancy are not postmodern, they are
fundamentalist, mythic.” For Atkins, postmodernism has to treat every myth as
an idol. Atkins defines the task of the contemporary religious philosopher to
live “shuttling back and forth” with “an agon with myth for philosophy and an
agon with philosophy for myth. Postmodern theology, thus, is a relishing of
myth and a relishing of demythologization, yet it is an endeavor that, to me,
seems like it can only be idiosyncratic, and a source of great dissonance.”</p>



<p>Finally, Atkins considers thinking “a form of&nbsp;<em>avodah,&nbsp;</em>is a holy, religious task” in which engagement with postmodern thought is necessary. He appreciated the “effort to amplify and beatify Torah (<em>yagdil Torah v’adir</em>),” by placing “it in conversation with the wisdom and insights of other traditions,” in this case postmodernism. &nbsp;He is deeply committed to the horizons of our lived Torah. For him, “Torah should speak to everything we know, love, and experience.”</p>

<h2><strong>Concerning Postmodernism and Jewish Thought-Zohar Atkins<br /></strong></h2>



<p><strong>Defining Postmodernism</strong></p>



<p>Postmodernism is notoriously—though perhaps appropriately—difficult to define.<br /> Is it a school of thought? A literary style propounded by a set of thinkers, writers, artists (often French)? A worldview rooted in skepticism so radical it always becomes its own object of critique? An aesthetic that fuses avant-garde and pop, a la Andy Warhol, Frank O’Hara, John Cage, and Lady Gaga? A historical epoch dating to 1968? A fancy or pretentious synonym for <em>contemporary? </em>A way of saying <em>modernism mamash </em> (<em>really</em> modernism)? </p>



<p><br />
If postmodernism is defined as an aversion to fixed labels and determinacy, is
there any purchase to the term—<em>l’shitato—</em>according to its own standards,
or is it a self-cancelling term, like a witness who comes before a court and
says, “I am an unreliable witness”? Perhaps it is impossible to write about
postmodernism; “one cannot look upon its face and live.”</p>



<p><br /> If I were postmodern, I cannot be said to have an identity; rather identity is something I perform. There is no self, just presentation. To be a subject is to be a prisoner of the social order; my name-dropping does not actually refer to thinkers out there in the world, but only to the act of citation itself, a gesture, a miming of authority. In this sense, the string of proper names, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, is no different than those found in, say, a song with many names in the lyrics.</p>



<p>One reason for the confusion is that one of
postmodernism’s chief proponents, Jean Francois Lyotard, defined
(paradoxically) the postmodern condition as the end of “grand narratives.” Yet
in so doing, Lyotard set up his own grand narrative, in which modernism was
said to be naive and postmodernism was presented as the end of history. In this
way, postmodernism’s self-representation is no different than the bombastic
pronouncements of Nietzsche’s Zarathustra or Hegel’s Absolute Spirit; I suppose
the main difference is the way in which these earlier iterations still aspired
at some ideal, whereas postmodernism aspired to pursue with one hand what it
took away with the other.</p>



<p>If Derrida has become a poster child for
postmodernism, then perhaps what distinguishes postmodern thought from its
critical antecedents is less its content than its mood, the mood of
disenchantment, levity, comedy, neurosis, anti-messianism; or as Derrida put it
“messianism without messianicity.”</p>



<p><strong>Postmodernism and Judaism&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the Roman Emperor
Vespasian for a yeshiva in Yavneh (Gittin 56b) he exchanged politically doomed
Temple-based Judaism for a new paradigm of Jewish life. Sometimes postmodernism
is presented in this way.</p>



<p>Yet if rabbinic Judaism saw itself as continuous with
its historical past, and still, at times, looked nostalgically to the figure of
the Temple in its fantasies, postmodernists emphasized and venerated&nbsp;<em>rupture</em>,
as implied in their prefix “post-”. Never mind that the slogan of literary
modernism was “make it new” (<a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/the-making-of-making-it-new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezra
Pound, translating an ancient Confucian sage</a>); never mind that montage and
irony and indeterminacy and ambiguity were already important conceits before
postmodernism became a cultural shibboleth. Never mind that skepticism is an
ancient tradition, that subjectivism took off with Descartes, that pragmatism
was a Neo-Kantian idea already popularized by William James in the 19th century,
or that the so-called “linguistic turn” can be traced to Wittgenstein, a
modernist, if not earlier to Herder, Schlegel, and the romantic movement?</p>



<p>The ubiquity and unclarity of the term&nbsp;<em>postmodern</em>&nbsp;means
that it often does more harm than help when appended to another term such as
“Jewish thought” or “Jewish theology.” Does postmodern Jewish thought mean
thought that is influenced by postmodern thinkers, thought that simply occurs
in a historic period known as postmodern, or thought that is treated by critics
as having the worst signature features of postmodern writing, namely,
convolution, sophistry, relativism, a “retreat from judgment” (Arendt), etc.?
The term is so contested that it is probably better just to say what one means
than make appeal to this proper name; though one thing shared by postmoderns
through their debt to Quintillian, Schlegel, and Kierkegaard, is that it is
impossible to say what one means; to think we can is to commit the “intentional
fallacy.” “There is nothing outside the text” (Derrida). </p>



<p>Even here, though, postmodern analysis proves no
different than its modernist antecedents; for whether the analysis is
structuralist or post-structuralist, Freudian or Foucauldian, the point is that
the interpreter, and not the text itself, holds the key to its interpretation.
In some ways this posture is quite compatible with a certain understanding of
oral Torah, whereby the meaning of the written Torah falls to the rabbis rather
than, say, the karaites, historians, or philologists. At the same time, the
sages of the Talmud still sought to ground their arguments in a reading of
verses from the Written Torah, and subsequently, in the precedent readings of
earlier sages.</p>



<p>I am not an expert in the thought of Tamar Ross or Rav
Shagar, yet I am a great admirer of anyone who, in an effort to amplify and
beatify Torah (<em>yagdil Torah v’adir</em>), places it in conversation with the
wisdom and insights of other traditions; Torah should speak to everything we
know, love, and experience. And even if Western thought is a kind of Exile, we
should take comfort in knowing that “the divine presence goes into Exile with
us.” Whether Ross, Shagar, and their expositor, Miriam Feldmann Kaye, succeed
or fail, we should applaud their effort at&nbsp;<em>kiddush hashem,&nbsp;</em>of
sanctifying (the Jewish) God. They follow the example of Maimonides, who said
that if Aristotle’s thought were true, the Torah would have to be read in light
of Aristotelian philosophy, and whose thought was, for a time, accused of being
heretical until it became a dominant school of Jewish thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The irony and self-contradiction of a postmodern
Torah, however, is the way in which it challenges the commonsense view of
truth. How can the critique of truth itself be true? What is meant by “truth”?</p>



<p>Reading Feldmann Kaye’s interview, my impression is
that she/Ross regards postmodernism in a positive light as the doctrine that
truth is decided through intersubjective agreement. To me, though, that’s not
postmodernism at all, but positivism, and I don’t see how it’s much different
than the historicist view established by the Conservative movement in the 19th
century. Perhaps the fundamental claim that revelation is ongoing, is
culturally rooted, is emergent, is not different in kind, but only in degree,
from the ideas of Zechariah Frankel. Majority rules is not postmodern, its just
liberal.&nbsp;<em>Minhag yisrael halachah hi&nbsp;</em>(the customs of Israel are
legally binding)—is no different than&nbsp;<em>Vox populi Vox Dei&nbsp;</em>or
Rousseau’s theory of the general will. We find the norm of law by consensus in
the Talmud; but law is not truth; and saying there are many truths a la
postmodernism is different than saying we can’t know the one truth; the former
is an ontological claim, while the later is an epistemological one.</p>



<p>For non-specialists for whom the above sounds rather
dense, let’s just put it this way, Franz Rosenzweig criticizes the view that
truth is decided by human will as “as if thinking,” a form of theological
hedging whereby the non-believer says that the only way to live a good life is
to act&nbsp;<em>as if&nbsp;</em>God exists. If postmodern Jewish theology is “as
if” thinking, is Pascal’s wager 2.0, I find it weak. If postmodern theology
just means existentialist religiosity, it’s both hardly new, and hardly
radical. Kierkegaard and Rebbe Nachman share the view that one cannot have
certain knowledge of anything, yet this self-skepticism becomes a tool for
motivating a leap of faith that, unsurprisingly, is outwardly quite submissive
to dogma and the protocols of religious observance. The only thing that
distinguishes a religious existentialist and a regular&nbsp;<em>eved hashem</em>&nbsp;is
the existentialist’s emphasis on&nbsp;<em>interiority</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Non-Foundationalism&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye invokes non-foundationalism as a
hallmark of both postmodern thought and postmodern Jewish thought, yet ends up
defining it in a foundationalist way as the agreement of people on what the
truth is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Heidegger, truth is “unconcealment,” not social
reality, which he sometimes derides as “hearsay” in&nbsp;<em>Being and
Time,&nbsp;</em>nor is truth some kind of individual experience a la the
romantics. Meanwhile, for Nietzsche, truth is perspectival, yet it is the task
of strong artists and thinkers to will their truth into existence by exercising
a will to power; consensus is for the herd of half-dead unoriginals who are
still too bound up with “slave morality,” whether they be religious
fundamentalists or bourgeois secularists (or, as we now see in our day, bourgeois,
religious fundamentalists). Heidegger is a non-foundationalist insofar as he
rejects systematic thought based on first principles, yet the reason for this
rejection is not because he is skeptic, but because he believes foundationalism
is ontologically impoverished, does not enable us to properly think, and
therefore, flourish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If non-foundationalism means we keep the Torah “simply
because” we are thrown into a heritage, rather than because we have good
rational reasons and justifications that can withstand critical (Western)
enquiry, this is a kind of honest, modest, and yet Rube-Goldbergish way of
utilizing academic thinkers to basically follow in the footsteps of Rebbe
Nachman’s simpleton (see the story “chacham and tam”). It’s good therapy for
people who are born into a thick knowledge of and commitment to Jewish life,
but it is unlikely to win any one over; perhaps this is its virtue—it’s
anti-patronizing, nice, polite pc liberalism. I happen to be a slave to God and
you happen not to be, but, hey, these are both just lifestyles we inherited
from our families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you believe that God revealed&nbsp;<em>everything&nbsp;</em>to
Moses, all the oral law, and all the principles for expounding it, it is very
difficult to make sense of the story in Menachot 29b in which Moses sits,
confused, in the back of R. Akiva’s classroom. If Rabbi Akiva is so great,
Moses asks, why wasn’t the Torah given to him? “Be quiet. Such did it come to
me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One might be tempted to ask, similarly, why God did
not reveal postmodern thought to Moses; why did God wait for our generation to
reveal postmodern philosophy? To ask such a question, though, is to go crazy,
for it is the kind of question that postmodern thought forbids asking with a
straight face (it is somehow less absurd to ask why God waited to reveal
relativity theory to Einstein).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, if we translate it into metaphysical terms, we can say that God wants us to be incapable of finding God. Postmodernism is just another name for&nbsp;<em>Galut Edom</em>, the Roman Exile. But these flights of poetic fancy are not postmodern, they are fundamentalist, mythic. Postmodernism is monotheistic insofar as it treats every myth as an idol, even the myths of Sinai and the myths of an unbroken&nbsp;<em>mesorah</em>. My shuttling back and forth represents not postmodern theology, but an agon with myth for philosophy and an agon with philosophy for myth. Philosophy<a> </a>sought to defang myth; religion is the submission to it. To be a religious philosopher is to defang and submit at once, to make a myth of defanging while defanging it. Postmodern theology, thus, is a relishing of myth and a relishing of demythologization, yet it is an endeavor that, to me, seems like it can only be idiosyncratic, and a source of great dissonance. If I were an amora, I would suggest that this dissonance is divinely prescribed, that philosophy corresponds to the first set of (broken) tablets and myth to the second (whole) set, both of which were kept in the ark together. And if I were an amora (playing Abaye to my own Rava) I would counter, and say the first set refers to myth while the second set refers to philosophy. Teiku.</p>



<p><strong>Use of Heidegger and Derrida in the
Interview&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Feldmann Kaye’s invocation of Heidegger is a tease;
little besides the name Heidegger is given to us that suggests what a
Heideggerian approach to revelation could involve, but even if there were, it
is arguable whether Heidegger can be called postmodern. He is certainly viewed
that way, negatively by Allan Bloom and positively by Richard Rorty. I have no
doubt that Heidegger has much to contribute to contemporary Jewish life and
thought, but none of the views espoused by Feldmann Kaye in the name of Shagar
and Ross fit Heidegger’s thought too well, and none reflect a deep
phenomenological influence; the value of cultural particularism is not unique
to Heidegger and Heidegger would have eviscerated terms like “culture” and
“experience” as remaining caught in a retrograde metaphysics of “humanism.”</p>



<p>When you compare Derrida to Heidegger, besides the
linguistic and political differences, you find a tonal difference. Heidegger’s
mood is heroic, tragic, messianic; Derrida’s is playful, jestful, cerebral.
Heidegger and Derrida are both gnomic writers; yet one senses with Heidegger
that he has something serious to say; with Derrida, one senses that the
performance is the point, that there is nothing besides the rhetoric. In
Heidegger, rhetoric serves the purpose of thought. In Derrida, one feels, there
is nothing besides rhetoric. Derrida scholars can disagree; Heidegger reads as
a reluctant spiritual Master, as a thinker. Derrida reads as a comedian, as
Aristophanes to Heidegger’s Socrates, which isn’t to say Derrida isn’t serious
or that there isn’t a seriousness to his jocularity, or that he doesn’t have
something to say. Still, one never feels levity reading terms like&nbsp;<em>Seinsfrage,
Geworfenheit</em>,&nbsp;<em>Erschlossenheit</em>,&nbsp;<em>die Frage nach dem
Technik</em>; meanwhile, Derrida’s essays seem haughtily pitched to deflate
everything of its gravity, as if any form of seriousness were somehow in danger
of becoming an instrument of fascism. One can certainly make the argument that
Heidegger is postmodern or else presages postmodern thought, yet his
aesthetic—even when playful, even when self-questioning—has a devotional
quality to it. We should consider whether postmodern Jewish thought and life
require us to be jesters in the Derridean mold or pietist in the Heideggerian
one. In the end, the issue of postmodernism might be one of tone and aesthetics
more than content (after all, postmodernism can also be framed as a privileging
of form and frame over content, e.g., “the medium is the message.”)</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For those of us who aspire to think, who believe it is of the utmost import, and who, as Jews, or as religious folk, believe that thinking is a form of&nbsp;<em>avodah,&nbsp;</em>is a holy, religious task, engagement with postmodern thought is necessary. It may be necessary even as a Jacob’s ladder we climb and then kick away. I don’t believe postmodern thought often succeeds in “thinking,” yet I believe it helps us spot the ways in which we are not yet thinking, and this humility is needed today, not just for ethical and political reasons, but also for spiritual ones. To know that one is not yet thinking, is this not&nbsp;<em>the awe of heaven?</em></p>



<p>I am grateful to Miriam Feldmann Kaye for introducing the question of postmodernism into the contemporary discussion of Jewish thought and theology, not because I believe postmodernism can save Jewish life or thought (I’m not sure any doctrine, even an anti-doctrinaire one could do this), but because the question of how to live a sincere, elevated, responsible, pious Jewish life that is critical, self-critical, and open-minded, is upon us.</p>

<p>This is the first in a sequence of responses to the interview with <a href="../../../../2019/09/16/interview-with-miriam-feldmann-kaye-jewish-theology-for-a-postmodern-age/index.html">Miriam Feldmann-Kaye about her book  <em>Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age</em></a><em>.</em> The second response is by Zohar Atkins- here. </p>



<p>The review deals with Feldmann-Kaye’s use of the writings of Rav Shagar. Morrow is pursuing a graduate degree on the writings of Rav Shagar so he has the passion of a graduate student in his vigorous comments. He rejects the ridged division of Rav Shagar into periods (such as “traditional,” “existentialist,” and “postmodern,”  Yet he still works with the division to note that an early homily based on the Maharal should not be used as postmodern, and to note that Rav Shagar has explicit Existential essays in the spirit of Sartre. Morrow points out how the book needed to update its 2002 references since the majority of the writing were published since that date. Finally, Morrow returns us the Israeli sociological meaning of postmodern as post Rav Kook’s religious national project in order to point out that Rav Shagar himself remained in the Yeshiva, taught Torah and was not aiming to be a postmodern, even when he read those works. </p>



<p>Levi Morrow is a Masters student at Tel Aviv University, and is writing his thesis on Rav Shagar and Franz Rosenzweig. He has translated a forthcoming book of Rav Shagar&#8217;s holiday derashot, as well as many of the teachings and poems of Rav Shagar&#8217;s friend and colleague Rav Menachem Froman. Levi teaches Jewish Philosophy in Jerusalem, where he lives with his wife and two daughters.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> A Postmodern Theology from the Writings of Rav Shagar? </strong></p>



<p>Dr. Miriam
Feldmann Kaye’s <em>Jewish Theology for a
Postmodern Age</em> focuses primarily on Rav Shagar and Dr. Tamar Ross. Is it
meant to introduce their respective theologies to the reader as examples of
postmodern Jewish theology? Or is it meant to use them as resources for the
author and readers’ own theologies? A close reading of the book indicates that
the latter is more correct, that constructive theology takes precedence to
historical scholarship. </p>



<p><strong>Understanding Rav
Shagar’s Context</strong></p>



<p>I
can’t speak to the depiction of Ross’s theology, but the depiction of Rav
Shagar cannot serve to introduce new readers to his theology. The focus on
Postmodernism renders it at best partial, and in some cases actually misleading
in understanding the thought of Rav Shagar. A few examples will suffice.</p>



<p>In
discussing the idea of cultural particularism and the historical conditioning
of the subject, Feldmann Kaye quotes from Shagar’s <em>Panekha Avakesh</em>, a collection of derashot on the parashah from when
he was interim Rosh Yeshivah of Yeshivat Hakotel in 1982-83. Feldmann Kaye
states:</p>



<p>Shagar’s conception of cultural
particularism relies on a forceful alienation and negation of the self, which
leads to an all-encompassing awareness of the influence of one’s surroundings. <em>He acknowledges the strong parallels between
postmodernism and hasidic introspection</em>&#8230; With the self utterly nullified,
the individual is no longer subject to delusions. She can look into herself as
if she were a perfect limpid vessel and finally appreciate who she is and,
indeed, <em>the extent to which her identity
and character are the result of a host of conditioning factors. </em>(<em>JTPA</em>, 34; emphasis added)</p>



<p>However, the text
she references doesn’t mention Postmodernism or Hasidism, and misses the source
of the self-negation in the writings of the Maharal. Rav Shagar stresses the
importance of negating the active, egoistic self, as well as purifying the self
from urges and desires, in favor of a return to the “source” and “root” of the
person, which enables recognition of divine truth (<em>Panekha Avakesh</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pUwjbadCE0_e5fY_LSE0YpA8nIAktgTp">62-63</a>). There are many types of
self-negation, and in some places Rav Shagar does connect it to the historical
conditioning of individual identity and character (see, for example, <em>Luhot U’shivrei Luhot</em>, 52). Here,
however, he’s talking about a pious duty to cleanse the self of desires and of
ego in order to connect to a person’s divine source and gain a divine
understanding of truth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I’m not of the opinion that his thought can be
neatly divided into periods (such as “traditional,” “existentialist,” and
“postmodern,” as I’ve heard suggested), but there’s clearly some truth to it.
His early texts (and <em>Panekha Avakesh</em>
is the earliest of his published teachings!) simply don’t reflect postmodern
themes and ideas, which would make some sense as he doesn’t seem to have read
them yet. Some of the same concerns may exist throughout, but the changing
forms these concerns take is important. Rav Shagar talks about negation of the
self, <em>bittul</em>, from his earliest texts
to his latest. In the former, this means humility, purification of the self,
and connection to the source. In the latter, it means recognizing the divine
nature of the self exactly as it is (<em>Luhot
U’shivrei Luhot</em>, 419).</p>



<p><strong>Sartre and
Existentialism </strong></p>



<p>Another
example of the value of a closer reading arises in a discussion of freedom. Feldmann
Kaye discusses an essay called “Freedom and Holiness” from the book <em>Kelim Shevurim</em> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RgzSiCDWQXJ1UC_4faJXgbtN7PpMZKN6">a lightly edited
version</a>
appears in the later <em>Luhot U’shivrei
Luhot</em>, and it was translated into English in <em>Faith Shattered and Restored</em>), and remarks that </p>



<p>Shagar guides his readers away from
the existentialist idea of freedom as individual autonomy. He takes Jean-Paul
Sartre to task by arguing that his understanding of the concept leads
inevitably to nihilism or fatalism&#8230; Shagar takes exception to Sartre’s
understanding of the self. The latter lays the burden of freedom on the
individual, placing on her shoulders the onus to choose her own essence and
thereby devise the ‘project’ that is her existence. Sartre saw the self as the
sole arbiter of values. Shagar, however, criticizes such a conception of
freedom on the basis that it leads to anarchy, and proposes instead to shift
the burden for formulating truth claims onto the community&#8230; he qualifies his
own version as ‘mystical freedom,’ that is, an inspired freedom derived from
‘the unity of the human and the divine’ which enables the community of Israel
to shape its own set of truths <em>ex nihilo</em>
(or in mystical terms as <em>yesh me’ayin</em>).
(<em>JTPA</em>, 40-41)</p>



<p>The
problem here is that Rav Shagar is actually aiming at a version of freedom
closer to Sartre than to any other thinker he mentions, a “Sartre Plus” model
rather than a rejection of Sartre (this is eminently clear from the essay, but
also from similar texts such as Passover derashot on freedom in <em>Zeman Shel Herut</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RfxXvVPFJXufzfdecy7mqo-6jKL5Q5XD">163-168</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16tHNbowy0mitNJRxwwAv93Cz6B4uNmWd">169-178</a>, and an essay on the self in <em>Nahalekh Baragesh</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzQYdQcngakSdG5jYzhNQlpCSnhZbUx2RlZjV1A4UDhybkNr">139-146</a>). In the essay, Rav Shagar
catalogues models of freedom, including that of the Tanakh, the Rambam, Rav
Kook, and Sartre. Of all of them, Sartre is the only one who believes that
freedom means the ability to create values, and this is what Rav Shagar wants
to embrace. </p>



<p>Rav
Shagar’s problem with Sartre is that Sartre, he says, thinks human creations
can never be meaningful because they can never transcend their creator and gain
a sense of absoluteness, meaning that a person can never commit to values that
she herself created. He solves this by paradoxically identifying human creation
with divine revelation. After a person creates their own values, they should
paradoxically see them as divine values to which they must commit. Living a
life of “covenant” (“<em>berit</em>”), Rav
Shagar says, means seeing our freely-made choices as inevitabilities, like a
person seeing their freely-chosen spouse as the only person they could possibly
have married. This is Rav Shagar’s “Sartre-Plus” model of freedom.</p>



<p>Moreover, the emphasis on community
that Feldmann Kaye sees in the essay is almost entirely lacking. The discussion
of the concept of freedom in Tanakh mentions that the “subject” with whose
freedom Tanakh is concerned is the nation, not the individual, and I can see
Feldmann Kaye could construe that toward a postmodern cultural particularism.
However, that concept is nowhere to be found in the section on “mystical
freedom,” or the passages on Rambam or Rav Kook, for that matter. The emphasis
is on the individual and her ability to make creative choices, and the essay
concludes with a discussion of how modern man (<em>ha’adam ha’akhshavi</em>, which if I would most accurately translate as
“the contemporary individual,” but that begs my conclusion) possesses an image of
God on the level of <em>ayin</em>,
nothingness, a liberating non-essentialism that allows them the ability to
create <em>ex nihilo.</em> </p>



<p><strong>Updating the References
</strong></p>



<p>On
a more technical note, I want to briefly address the issue of references. <em>JTPA</em> is a revised version of Feldmann
Kaye’s 2012 PhD dissertation, and it has been excellently converted by the publisher
into a more popularly accessible book. One area that did not receive enough
attention in the intervening years, however, was the references to Rav Shagar’s
writings. Many volumes of his writings have been published since then, and
referencing (nevermind quoting) them would certainly have enriched the book,
but they are almost entirely absent (with the exception of <em>She’erit Ha’emunah</em>). Just to give one example, her discussions of
both cultural particularlism and linguistic determinism would be greatly
enhanced by Rav Shagar’s Hanukkah derashah “Religious Life in the Modern Age,” <em>Faith Shattered and Restored</em>,” 41-65,
published in Hebrew as “<em>Halakhah,
Halikhah, Ve’emunah</em>,” <em>Le’ha’ir Et
HaPetahim</em>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzQYdQcngakSaDgzREZxY0NJd1E">158-186</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, many of the references
may have made sense in 2012, but the publishing since then has made them
confusing. For example, there are references to “<em>Broken Vessels</em>, vol. 2,” a non-existent second volume of <em>Kelim Shevurim</em>. For someone well versed
in the editors’ footnotes to Rav Shagar’s writings from before it was published
in 2013, this is clearly <em>Luhot U’Shivrei
Luhot</em>, which the editors sometimes referenced as a forthcoming, expanded,
second edition of <em>Kelim Shevurim</em>.
However, for anyone not so versed, the reference is unhelpful (this also means
that the correct pagination could have been tracked down, and wasn’t).
Similarly, there is the essay “My Faith” which has been published twice, in
Hebrew and English (<em>Luhot U’Shivrei Luhot</em>,
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eA5DWzht-tK4rAOLg5hbrnykxQdxM7GK">407-426</a><em>;
Faith Shattered and Restored</em>,
21-39), but which in 2012 was an unpublished file available only to those in
the know. Feldmann Kaye’s reference to the text demonstrates just how thorough
her PhD was, but the lack of an updated reference, referring to either of the
essay’s two versions, is frustrating. </p>



<p><strong>Is Rav Shagar a
Postmodern?</strong></p>



<p>By
way of conclusion, I would return to more substantive issues Is Rav Shagar a
Postmodernist, or a thinker who deals with Postmodernity? ( cf. <em>JTPA</em>, 35) He is certainly the latter;
perhaps he is sometimes the former, but he is also so much more than that. It
is a shame that so much of the discussion about him revolves solely around his
interest in Postmodernism. He was a constructive
theologian as a Rosh Yeshiva, deeply in tune with the cultural and religious
shifts his community was undergoing, and he marshalled the best of the Jewish
tradition and his readings of non-Jewish philosophy to respond appropriately.</p>



<p>As with the first example in this review based on the Maharal, there are of &nbsp;many more postmodern counterexamples from Rav Shagar’s writings. In one text, he explicitly denies the ability of a person to create <em>ex nihilo</em>, instead celebrating the bricolage of creating something new out of something else (See <em>She’erit Ha’emunah</em>, 24). But that itself is exactly the point. There is so much in the writings of Rav Shagar, which are quite rich and full of theological explorations, that make it reductionist to consider them only from a postmodern perspective. Rav Shagar was a born-and-raised Kookian Religious Zionist, a Post-Kookian Religious Zionist, a brilliant talmudist, a driving force in Religious Zionism’s Hasidic revolution, an existentialist, and yes, a postmodernist as well. Appreciating all of the different voices that emerge from his writings requires care and precision, something I find somewhat lacking in <em>Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age</em>. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the matter of
Postmodernism quickly becomes a question of what we, and Rav Shagar, mean by
it. Tomer Persico and Alan Brill <a href="https://7minim.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/pomo/">have &nbsp;shown</a>
how Religious Zionist opponents of “Postmodernism” and Rav Shagar himself
define postmodernism as liberal individualism. For all of them, “Postmodernism”
is what comes after and/or attacks the ideas of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and
his son, Rabbi Tzvi Yehudah Kook, a category that can include a lot more than
what people typically call “Postmodernism” such as Buber, Sartre, and Rav Nachman.
</p>



<p>It’s not incidental that Rav Shagar’s
“postmodernism” is shaped by his Jewish theological context. He spent his whole
life in the yeshivah system, never attending university, and was not shy about
his unfaithful, ahistorical readings of secular philosophical texts: “We aren’t committed to ‘scientific,’ faithful-to-the-original,
readings of Western or Eastern philosophy” (<em>Luhot
U’Shivrei Luhot</em>, 132-133).</p>



<p>On some level, there’s something
fundamentally strange about trying to identify Rav Shagar with a given
philosophical stream, while he was so self-conscious and explicit about
appropriating a variety of such streams for his own theological ends.
Understanding Rav Shagar requires paying close attention not to his
affiliations but to his appropriations, the way his readings of non-Jewish
texts constructively shape both those texts and his understanding of Judaism,
“the external light and the internal vessel.”(ibid.).</p>



<p><em>JTPA</em> is an excellent constructive work,
one that attempts to delineate specifically postmodern issues for theology, and
then proposes methods for dealing with them through readings of Rav Shagar and
Dr. Ross. Feldmann Kaye’s call for a “visionary theology,” one deeply in tune
with both Jewish mysticism and the power of religious language, is a call for
us to do much the same.</p>

<p>Anthony Giddens, the world-renowned sociologist divides Western modernity into three periods, the enlightenment, modernism, and late modernity. The Enlightenment as the first form of modernity, characterized by the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries’ attempt to turn towards literacy, reason, science, and autonomy, as well as the fight against the old regime and traditionalism. Modernism, the second form of modernity, is the enthusiastic embrace of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries’ turn to urbanization, individuality, and new understandings of humanity and society. The goal was to cultivate a religion that grapples with modernist challenges and accounts for individuality. Modernist expert knowledge— such as science or the university— during this period was authoritative. Late modernity, the third form of modernity, was a loss of trust in the expert authority of modernity, which resulted in the emergence of multiple forms of authority while also embracing the new materialism and post-secularism. We are in the later age. Some who emphasize philosophy and theory call this period last period postmodernism, a period that sees the limits of modernism. and its universal visions. </p>



<p>Among those using this philosophic language is the recent book by Miriam Feldmann Kaye, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Theology-Postmodern-Cultural-Studies/dp/1906764689">Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age </a></em>( Liverpool University Press in association with&nbsp; Library of Jewish Civilization, 2019), a short but smart book encouraging us to simultaneously expand our horizons and those of contemporary Jewish theology.

<p>Feldmann Kaye’s book seeks to make philosophy and theological meaning from the writings of Rabbi Shagar and Prof Tamar Ross. She seeks to rescue them from sociological explanations grounded in changes in Israeli culture, and instead, sees them as directions for Jewish thought in the post-modern age, postmodern in the broad sense of general philosophic trend after modernity.  </p>

<p>Feldmann Kaye’s method is to first present the theological tenor of the current age, followed by showing how Rabbi Shagar and Prof Ross fit into this age, then to give examples and directions for expanding these ideas. &nbsp;Feldmann Kaye is comfortable contextualizing her subjects in postmodern thinkers even if the subjects themselves have not read them.&nbsp; If Wittgenstein is important in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and her two thinkers fit into this trend of Wittgenstein, then she can offer other thinkers and ideas – such as by Paul Ricoeur, W. V. O. Quine, or Martin Heidegger- to amplify and develop the idea. &nbsp;This method would be akin to discussing the Existential Age of Buber, Sartre and Camus, then showing that Heschel and Soloveitchik should be contextualized as Existentialists, and concluding with ideas from Tillich, Maritain, or Rahner. </p>



<p>All her discussion points to Feldmann Kaye’s own &#8220;visionary theology&#8221; bursting out between the lines of the book never articulated, even with my coaxing for this interview. She has sympathy for the post-secular 21<sup>st</sup> century ideas of Richard Kearney’s anantheism and Jean Luc Marion’s saturated event.  She wants to open up to a theology &#8220;which does not rely on an ultimate and singular truth, but posits instead that the notion of a multiplicity of truths.&#8221; For Feldmann-Kaye &#8220;The implications are twofold: firstly, since faith does not lend itself to scientific verification, it becomes difficult to justify a preference for one’s own world view or way of life. Second, if such truths are perceived as culturally particular social constructs, their prime function is limited to defining communal boundaries.&#8221; &nbsp;I heard part of it at the World Congress of Jewish Studies in 2017. &nbsp;I hope to hear more. </p>



<p>The book focuses on three specific themes in their thought, (1) Cultural Particularism, (2) Language, and (3) Revelation. </p>



<p>In 1979, Lyotard published <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postmodern_Condition">The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge</a>,</em> a work acknowledging that the era of modernism and existentialism had ended. In its place, Lyotard offered skepticism about universalizing theories and a rejection of universals and metanarratives. Feldmann Kaye relies heavily on this seminal work to define the philosophic climate of our era.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size">The first, cultural particularism is Feldmann Kaye’s way of saying that there are only local religious truths; no longer do thinkers have to respond to modernist universals of authority and knowledge. Rav Shagar has an approach of being at home in the study hall and one finds one’s truth in the study hall, while Prof Ross has an approach of working within the particularistic canon of Kabbalah, Hasidut, and Rav Kook. Feldmann Kaye does not discuss the biographic element that Rav Shagar and Tamar Ross were friends and talked to each about theology. Nor does it discuss their specific personal uses of Hasidut, Rather, her book discusses the relationship of kabbalah and postmodernism in the thought of Sanford Drob and the role of truth in Heidegger. </p>



<p>The concept Feldmann Kaye focusses on is that of language and especially of Lyotard’s reading of Wittgenstein. Lyotard (mis)used Wittgenstein’s phrase “private language” to mean that there are no longer universal truths. She shows how Rav Shagar and Prof. Ross each have a sense of a private language and she discusses parallels in Richard Rorty, Jean Baudrillard, more Heidegger. &nbsp;I wish she had been more analytic here since Wittgenstein is subject to many interpretations by theologians. Evangelical and Fundamentalists read Wittgenstein as interpreted by the scholar DZ Phillips as a fideism, a dogmatic private language in which the gospels are a private language not subject to any alien methods. In contrast, the scholar Norman Malcolm reads Wittgenstein as only allowing an act of faith since we cannot have any certain knowledge. But I believe Prof Ross is closer to a third reading, in which language is the rules of a game or the grammar. </p>



<p>Finally, Feldmann Kaye’s third topic is revelation based on these ideas of truth and language. She shows that Prof Ross accepts an idea of progressive revelation, a metaphysical idea of the unfolding of the truth, which she based on Kabbalah and Hasidut. But rather than discuss the Ross’ feminist application of this view of revelation, Feldmann Kaye opens up the discussion to Paul Ricoeur’s theory of interpretation. Rav Shagar uses the language of the study hall and treats the ongoing creativity of the Torah scholar in what he calls lamdanut as revelation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be posted a few responses to this interview in order to generate some discussion. I will return with some clarifications and some of my own views on the topics after the responses. We should thank Miriam Feldmann Kaye for opening this discussion with her smart book  <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Theology-Postmodern-Cultural-Studies/dp/1906764689">Jewish Theology for a Postmodern Age </a></em> about the importance of contemporary thought for Jewish thology. In the meantime, this is a good chance to read, if you have never read it, Lyotard’s <em>The Postmodern Condition </em>a dated period piece and then jump to the 21<sup>st</sup> century by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anatheism-Returning-Insurrections-Critical-Religion/dp/0231147899">Richard Kearney’s <em>Anatheism: Returning to God After God</em> <em> </em>(2011</a>) to get a sense of how the secular ideas of postmodernism are used by 21<sup>st</sup> century religious theologians including Miriam Feldmann Kaye. </p>

<ol><li><strong>Are you actually discussing postmodernism?</strong></li></ol>



<p>The thinkers I
deal with Rabbi Shagar and Tamar Ross grapple with late 20th century modernist
thought continuing to read current thought through to the current era. Rabbi
Shagar joins several Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century who engaged with
the existentialist movement, Ross with analytic engagement. Both of them
grapple with Rav Kook, joining the ranks of some of the most significant
theologians in contemporary times. </p>



<p>It would be
reductionist to call them ‘postmodern thinkers’. I have clarified this
important point &#8211; that the majority of thinkers I deal with, reject the term “postmodern”,
and especially the label of “postmodern thinker”, and I have tried to respect
this throughout. They are not just postmodern thinkers, but rather, draw on a
breadth and a depth of contemporary philosophical movements.</p>



<p>In fact, I am
not dependent on the term ‘postmodernism’ and would not have been opposed to
using in the title the term “twenty-first century Jewish philosophy”, or even
more specifically, contemporary. In the way in which I have used it,
postmodernism refers to the temporal era of the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> and
start of the 21<sup>st</sup> century A period after modernity – literally
post-modern- in which we see the limits of modernity. In its most basic sense,
postmodernism embodies a critique of different elements of modernity. </p>



<p>Having said
that, taking sensitivities into account, I am not afraid of the term
postmodern, and neither to use the word relativism, and believe that these
words and concepts must challenge and draw us in as much as they repel us. </p>



<p>I do not think that postmodernism immediately signals relativism – it is important and preferable to separate between the two, and challenge the ambivalence towards the term. In the more lenient use of the word ‘postmodern’ in this book, I draw attention to what is meant by using this frame of Jewish thinkers who engage with postmodern philosophy. </p>



<p>2. <strong>Is ambivalence towards Postmodernism justified? </strong></p>



<p>I want to
address the ambivalence towards the term postmodern. Postmodernism is a contentious
word which is easily associated, by some, with a nihilistic relativism. The
outlooks it espouses indeed reflect a breakdown of ultimate truths and values. </p>



<p>I actually
identify with the hesitation surrounding the term, and have sought to break
down the fear in a way that theologians have done for centuries with
surrounding cultural movements which have seemed, and which have been, strongly
at odds, with the worldview that one seeks to maintain. </p>



<p>This is why I
decided to change the title of the book, initially, “Jewish Theology <em>in</em>
a Postmodern Age”, to “Jewish Theology <em>for</em> a Postmodern Age”. This
change frames the purpose of the book – Jewish theology engages with its
contemporaneous philosophical trends, and the volume addresses profound
development of what will, in my view, become an immersion in the areas of
intellectual creativity that the postmodern age has begun to offer. It must be
understood as an enigma which demands our attention and as a challenge to
thought, rather than a corrosive problem which must be destroyed. </p>



<p>The change in
the book was made to highlight the distinctions between postmodern philosophy
and Jewish thought, and to reflect the nature of the book which is a
philosophical quest to understand the parameters of a new conversation. </p>



<p>In light of
this, theology takes an active role engaging in that conversation where
postmodernism as a worldview might be constructive, as well as destructive, to
contemporary Jewish philosophical debate. </p>



<p>I made clear in
the outset of the book, that my aim has not been to defend postmodernism –
rather, to examine its various themes, as a negotiation with diverse elements
of Jewish thought in the twenty-first century. This means leveraging what
philosophy of religion became towards the end of the twentieth century –
existentialist, dialogical, pragmatic, and following how these ideas develop
into the new century. In this sense the main question becomes whether and how Jewish
thought which can function and be compelling, in today’s world.</p>



<p>This change reflects my approach towards the thinkers I deal with: their engagement with issues of the day, does not necessarily class them as postmodern thinkers. Rather, I have written about their thinking as addressing certain issues that postmodern philosophy raises, and the acute questions it raises. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Why is it important to approach Rabbi Shagar’s and Tamar Ross’ thought from a philosophical viewpoint? </strong></p>



<p>One of the main characteristics of the book, has been to set
aside sociological analyses of both Shagar and Ross. My own academic training
has been in the field of philosophy of religion. </p>



<p>This forms the backdrop for my intense engagement with Shagar
and Ross. It is the lens through which I examine numerous texts. I probe their
thinking, asking the critical questions of contemporary times, from a Jewish
perspective. I specifically analyse Shagar’s later engagement with non-Jewish
continental philosophers, even if he did not read them, which is so important,
in my view, for understanding the true contribution he makes to contemporary
Jewish thought. I am interested in the epistemological and linguistic
contributions that Ross makes to Jewish philosophy, seeing feminism as a case
in point, rather than as the central objective. </p>



<p>In Israel, some of the discussion around the yeshiva world of Shagar is associated with New Age and the pop-Hasidut of contemporary “spirituality”. Much continues to be written on this topic. Suffice it to say, there is more than meets the eye to this neo-Hasidic thinking, which actually calls for an understanding of the roles of Hasidut and Kabbalah in postmodern theology. </p>



<p>4. <strong>What are Rabbi Shagar’s and Prof Tamar Ross’s main contributions?</strong></p>



<p>Ross and Shagar
are engaging in an original dialogue about culture, language, revelation. </p>



<p>They both demand
a revision of the concept of Torah and revelation for a postmodern age. Shagar
and Ross are two of the first thinkers to reconceptualise revelation on terms
which do not get caught in the issues of modernity.&nbsp; Although in the book I deal with their
thinking in parallel, I draw points of reference for comparison and contrast. </p>



<p>The book shows how this dialogue is representative of the sort of discussion seeking to engage which strands of contemporary philosophy will be most accepted in contemporary Jewish thought. In this way, we are offered an unusual insight into how they firstly recognise, and secondly handle postmodern ideas. This forms the basis for an analytical consideration of how internal Jewish theological ideas are interpreted in this age.</p>



<p>5. <strong>What is Cultural Particularism?</strong></p>



<p>The
book is split into three main conceptual sections: cultural particularism,
language and revelation. </p>



<p>“Cultural
particularism’” is a central feature of postmodernism.I use
this term to refer to the position which states that our understanding and interaction
with the world is contingent upon culture. </p>



<p>According
to radical interpretations of cultural particularism, the category of
objectivity is limited altogether, and only multiple different perspectives
based on local perceptions and interpretations, each anchored in a specific
cultural context, hold water. </p>



<p>Furthermore,
in these interpretations the notion of objectivity is a figment of our
philosophical imagination, itself conceived through the lenses of our
respective cultures. </p>



<p>In
my book, I analyse the impact of this contentious theory specifically in the
realm of religion. Firstly, postmodern theology regards religion as a
particularistic endeavour, fundamentally rooted in cultural idiosyncrasies. As
a result, it downplays the modernist quest for universal truth and objectivity
outside one’s culture. Secondly, truth claims no longer purport to represent
absolute, universal, and justifiable statements about the world. A radical postmodernist world view conceives of
an individual’s values and beliefs as a drop in an ocean of culturally-accepted
norms. </p>



<p>This shift in thinking carries far-reaching implications in the domain of Jewish theology. Currently, most Jewish religious responses to the challenge of cultural particularism have come, perhaps inevitably, from a generation of thinkers who have found themselves in a transitional period between modernity and postmodernism. Even though philosophically they accept the notion of multiple truths, they still dread the ethical and practical implications of relativism. </p>



<p>6. <strong>How does Rav Shagar deal with Cultural Particularism?</strong></p>



<p>In
discussing their treatment of the problem of multiple truths and relativism, I show
how their arguments facilitate the acceptance of a multiplicity of
truth-claims. Nevertheless, I underscore a persistent refusal on their behalf
to what they view to be a ‘collapse’ into a relativism according to which one’s
own faith holds nothing truer than that of others. </p>



<p>Shagar
appropriates cultural particularism by rendering truth subject to a cultural
context. He rejects the idea of a fixed, monolithic truth as little more than
an artificial, human construct.The way he envisions the community
‘playing’ a sophisticated language game allows for a degree of freedom and
human creativity rarely observed in traditional circles. </p>



<p>Cultural
particularism, the deconstruction of the universal, of the monolithic, is linked
to Shagar’s notion of <em>Beit’iut&nbsp;
-“home-ness” shorashiut – “rootedness”</em>. The philosophical ‘home’ is
the starting point of theology, rather than an empirically decided universal
standpoint. Beitiut is an example that Shagar uses for cultural particularism.
Religious meaning is where the home is. The starting point for &#8216;doing&#8217;
philosophy is not a neutral or objective standpoint &#8211; rather it begins and
necessarily must remain, in the particularist context called &#8216;home&#8217;.</p>



<p>In
Shagar’s discussion on <em>Shabbat</em> and the Hindu ritual of <em>Samadhi</em>,
he draws comparisons between the spirituality of these two states of existence.
The home is the contextual and therefore conceptual starting point, which I
delineate as cultural particularism. </p>



<p>Given the role of immersion in contextual community, often described as a socially constructed community, collective discourses are what inform practice and conversation around its meaning. The individual does not operate in a theological vacuum, as he or she did prior to these times, even in times where existentialism was most prominent in religious discourse – wherein the personal experience affected and was effected by one’s own religious experience – the <em>ennui</em> or malaise of the age. </p>



<p>7. <strong>How does Prof Tamar Ross deal with Cultural Particularism?</strong></p>



<p>Tamar
Ross views local religious truths as valuable precisely because they are
relative to a particular group. She uses this relativism to put forward a
non-empirical, kabbalistic, metaphysical truth, and in so doing, endeavours to
redeem relativism from its negative connotations. She affirms the relative
nature of each religion, and claims that such a conception of religious truth
permeates the history of Jewish thought</p>



<p>&nbsp;Ross, like Shagar, dismisses the self as the
frame of reference for determining reality. She reaches this conclusion by
exploring the implications of a Kookian, Hasidic conception of the divine as a
singular unity, which converge with the postmodern breakdown of subjective and
objective.</p>



<p>Having internalized the
epistemological uncertainty characteristic of the postmodern critique.</p>



<p>Ross seeks to establish a sound ground for religious
knowledge. She turns for that reason to non-foundationalism, a contemporary
epistemological position that justifies truth-claims not on the basis of their
purported grounding in some neutral or objective source of knowledge, but on
the degree to which they cohere with other beliefs and opinions. This attitude
she contrasts favourably against any sort of radical postmodern relativism, which
turns the rejection of absolute truth into nihilism and anarchy on the
simplistic assessment that all truth-claims are of equal value. Instead of
establishing the truth-value of a proposition against the background of an
objective, metaphysical source, non-foundationalists rely on intersubjective
agreement within the wider community</p>



<p>Ross
similarly takes Kook’s innovative and non-traditional theology as an inspiring
model. She describes him as ‘wise to be suspicious of all claims to absolute
truth, or to any direct and perfect correspondence between our perceptions and
ontological reality’. Indeed, she identifies with his scepticism and notes that
such a feeling ultimately leads to ‘a fundamental shift in the expectations
surrounding traditional theological claims’.</p>



<p>However, for her, cultural particularism, does justify one’s
ability to posit a belief of ‘truth’, without believing that this constitutes
the only truth. From an analytic philosophy perspective if a truth is
subjective, then it is not Truth. </p>



<p>From the perspective of continental thought, it is evident that this misses the point. It is perspectival. This forms the demand for postmodern deconstruction of the notion of Truth altogether, linking to the ‘inter-subjectivity’ of Heidegger amongst others. </p>



<p>8. <strong>Is Cultural Particularism relativism?</strong></p>



<p>There is a
question asked of Shagar: if cultural particularism defines the starting point,
the all-pervasive contextualisation of language and culture have the potential
to relativize values as a whole. </p>



<p>We find a response to this question in Ross’ discussion of
the self through Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam- even if it was not used by
Shagar or Ross. Analytic (behaviouralist or neopragmatic) theories of language,
propounded by Rorty, Putnam and Quine, is the idea that language it holds
meaning insofar as it means something to the one who uses or understands that
language. In other words, a metaphysical being or essence is not assumed when
using such language. How is this constructive in philosophy of religion?
Because the distinctions&nbsp;between language as &#8216;true&#8217; or &#8216;false&#8217; need not
bother us so much anymore. Philosophy has moved on from these questions, and
this gives us the opportunity to reconsider a Jewish theory of language. I have
said many times, that this is not necessarily a new idea, but the response to
it, in the relevant discourse, is highly original.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Ross, this reading deepens the question as to how
mysticism should be understood. If not given to neo Hasidic spirituality, how
should mysticism be interpreted on the philosophical level? Empirically or
allegorically? In response to the theory of cultural particularism and
relativism, she responds by questioning the role that truth claims play, rather
than their supposed abstract metaphysical essence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Shagar addressed the issue through an interpretation of Slavoj
Zizek’s reading of Jacques Lacan, and the idea of chosenness. Shagar provides us with
a unique reading of this sort of discourse, interspersed with interpretations
of Hasidut, and its relevance to this new thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately Shagar bequeaths to us a “hierarchy of truth”,
rather than an acceptance of the zero sum game that some modern vs. postmodern
debates seem to embody. </p>



<p>I critique all these responses concerning the limitations as to how far Jewish thinkers can go in cultural particularism without falling into relativism. I end this section with a broader observation that the deconstruction of universalism, plays an ethical role in its breakdown of the fallacious belief in ‘one truth fits all’. </p>



<p>9. <strong>How do both thinkers deal with language in a postmodern age?</strong></p>



<p>If language cannot describe anything beyond itself, how can
any statement be true? Do beliefs serve any purpose if they do not express
something true about the world? According to postmodern theory, each culturally
particular community functions according to its own semantic and linguistic
system, similar to Martin Heidegger’s “intra-worldly” and Ross’ “inter-subjectivity”.
</p>



<p>For Tamar Ross, certain aspects of this new postmodern philosophy
of religion become fundamental in examining what we mean when we use
theological language. To give three examples, Francois Lyotard claimed that
meaning is contingent on its context. For Rorty, language serves the claim of
different collectives, and in this sense is functional. Jurgen Habermas and
others view this in a constructive way – how does meaning arise in a particular
cultural context? </p>



<p>Wittgenstein’s theory of the “language game” is utilised at
various points in constructing postmodern positions, by Shagar and Ross. </p>



<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein&#8217;s concept of &#8221;language games&#8221;&nbsp;is
often held up as his flagship contribution to the philosophy of language.
However, his idea of &#8216;Forms of Life&#8217; is critical in studying a contemporary
Jewish consideration of religious language. It is in fact&nbsp;far more telling
of the nature of religion today,&nbsp;and how language functions as a
theological tool in our communities.</p>



<p>Thus, the role of Wittgensteinian thought must be reconsidered. It is at this point where the role of language comes in. Ross in a way, clears the path for what Shagar means when he speaks of revelation.</p>



<p>10. <strong>Does Language affect Reality?</strong></p>



<p>Before the advent of postmodernism,
philosophers generally viewed language as concordant with reality. In other
words, they assumed that the words, phrases, and sentences we use correspond to
the objects in the world that we purport to describe. This assumption that a
‘signifier’ (most notably, in speech) necessarily relates to a specific
‘signified’ is known as ‘correspondence theory’. Philosophers of language, in
turn, seek to investigate the nature of this relation. They consider, among
other questions, <em>whether</em> and <em>how</em> language reflects reality. This is
known as ‘the problem of language’.<strong></strong></p>



<p>For Shagar, language illustrates,
and manifests itself through, reality. It is the nature of reality, which
changes, together with that of language. According to Jean Baudrillard, the
very nature of reality alters according to the cultural-linguistic turn. I
discuss his theory of semiotics as coinciding with theological interpretations
of reality. </p>



<p>Shagar wrote about Baudrillard,
combining his thinking on the nature of reality with mysticism. This led Shagar
to an analysis of the role of mystical language as descriptive of reality,
without having to be understood as empirically historic. Semiotics is the study of signs. It relies on the fact that our
understanding of society comes through ‘signification’ (signs) which are
referred to by language and in the media, but that do not exist in and of
themselves. Hence language and cultural rituals <em>symbolize</em>, but do not embody, reality.</p>



<p>Today’s world is full of ‘signs’. Although we may not be fully
aware of them, these signs surround us, and effectively build up what
Baudrillard terms a simulated ‘hyper-reality’. Facebook and Twitter, for
example, create an artificial, simulated social existence. Virtual exchanges on
the cyberspace&#8212;on our smartphones and computers&#8212;allow individuals to bypass
reality. It is crucial to
recognize that a simulated reality is not a false reality. It means that we are
aware of the factors that make our reality what it is. Shagar turns to
Baudrillard to reconfigure the role of language in postmodern religion. His
position is original on two accounts: it acknowledges the problem of language,
and in response, re-envisages it as a network of signs that help the religious
community generate its own simulated reality.To him, the language
of the community serves to engender, rather than merely refer to, the religious
values of its adherents. </p>



<p>The way Shagar is able to accommodate these positions is by relying
on the Jewish mystical tradition. He employs concepts drawn most notably from
Lurianic kabbalah and Bratslav hasidism to draw out a theological discourse
that comprises both postmodern linguistic elements and traditional ones.</p>



<p>Through Ross we arrive at a fascinating, and
distinct treatment of the language in her interest in the structures and types
of language available to us. For her, the metaphor is instrumental in opening a
world of reality which might lend themselves to, as she says, “direct
intimations of the Divine”, </p>



<p>&nbsp;For Jacques Derrida, we find that metaphors can express truths with more power than any literal statement. For language is poetic, and imaginative, rather than literal. So, literal statements about empirical facts on which religious claims might be made, are in fact, lacking in their potential for describing a reality far beyond what is imaginable, and therefore more fitting to the sort of dialogue that we have. The purposes of language in the realm of theology, are less to describe factual events, and more to create and sustain a phenomenologically compelling image of the world as it is true to us. In this sense, we move further away from the language game as a problem for theology. </p>



<p>11. <strong>How do the chapters on culture and language lead to a new approach to revelation?</strong></p>



<p>The first two
chapters bring together a new approach to <em>Torah min Hashamayim ‘ (loosely
‘translated’ as Torah from Heaven) </em>wherein the ‘text’ responds to the
issues raised in the two previous chapters. <em>Torah min hashamayim</em> (Torah
from Heaven) is released from modern ongoing debates of science vs religion.
Denominations as being formed around responses to these questions. Certain
Jewish communities, particular in the diaspora, retain this question as the
overall arbiter of what is meant by Jewish thought. Moreover, it is applied to
aspects of Jewish practice. </p>



<p>Ross’ epistemology is her idea of cumulative revelation –
where Torah min Hashamayim is understood as a perpetually unfolding reality,
manifesting itself in the lives of those who live by it. Shagar’s position is
not dissimilar – but expressed in a more yeshiva-style way, wherein truths and
meaning in Torah are unravelled through <em>Lamdanut</em>&nbsp; &#8211; ultimately a theory of interpretation and
hermeneutics. Torah inherently refers to and embodies continual revelation. For
both, <em>Torah min Hashamayim</em> is a continual, ongoing, dynamic process,
accompanied by upholders of the faith via halakhic debate and praxis, and
engagement with textual exegesis and its intersections with the <em>ruach</em> –
spirit &#8211; of the world around us. The will of God is continually discovered in
each generation. Neither position is necessarily ‘postmodern’ but it is
expressed in language of the cultural-linguistic turn. So, the “life of the
text” as Mikhail Bakhtin argues, presents a solicitation of the text within and
outside of a language game, reaching out beyond this world to an unspeakable
reality – necessarily undetermined (“deferred” according to Derrida) in
postmodern theory. </p>



<p>The book compares Tamar Ross to Paul Ricoeur’s understanding of the “conflict of interpretations” and its meaning in a textually generative community. Linguistic interpretative techniques are esoteric in their nature, pulled out of a static existenceand given a life of their own, in a dynamic, living process. Similarly, for Shagar,<em> Lamdanut</em>, does not constitute a language game, but a reaching out for a reality, generating its genuineness as a phenomenological community. <em>Lamdanut</em> and biblical and Talmudic interpretation, represents a grappling with the text which fits with the notion of postmodern hermeneutic activity as part of the continuing manifestation of oral Torah. It is here that Covenant becomes the immense and intense engagement in this process, in its various manifestations.</p>



<p>12. <strong>How is phenomenology important to this thinking about revelation?</strong></p>



<p>The phenomenological
movement of the 1920’s sought to explore the philosophical articulation of
human experience. Edmund Husserl, and later, Martin Heidegger, put forward the
claim that experience happens with human existence, rather than as separate
from it. Whilst it was others who were to apply this to religion, it has come
to provide a different and more useful way of considering religious language
and the experience around linguistic dialogue. Experience is a key component of
how religious meaning and truth are understood. Religious phenomena include the
sense of the miraculous, the encounter with a striking text, or the sensation
of transcendence at a holy site. It is the community as phenomenological
discourse, which accepts upon itself the ultimate link to and connection with
Torah. </p>



<p>Revelation as “perpetual revelation” is a development on the
acceptance of the ideas of cultural particularism and language. Revelation and
the language through which it is understood and experienced, depend on the
nature of reality. </p>



<p><em>Torah min Hashamayim</em> becomes the primary cultural particularist,
linguistic conduit, for religious experience, rather one that works against it.
Study is itself done through language and Torah is transmitted from Moses to
Sinai in our very textual and dialogic activity. This is one of the main points
that we arrive at in postmodern Jewish theology.</p>



<p>&nbsp;And it is this that I
have termed Visionary Theology – an embryonic model for Jewish thought today. </p>



<p>The methodology reflects the objective, which is to weave
together postmodern and Jewish thinking side by side, rather than as
conflicting opposites. &nbsp;I place
Jean-Francois Lyotard and Michel Foucault alongside Jewish thinkers in speaking
about the first step of my claim – cultural particularism. Much of contemporary
Christian post-metaphysical theology deals similar themes, such as that of
Jean-Luc Marion and Richard Kearney – an area of theology which I continue to
research. </p>



<p>I have put forward the case for their opening up to a
Visionary Theology which does not rely on an ultimate and singular truth, but
posits instead that the notion of a multiplicity of truths as compatible with
Judaism. </p>



<p>The implications are twofold:
firstly, since faith does
not lend itself to scientific verification, it becomes difficult to justify a
preference for one’s own world view or way of life. Second, if
such truths are perceived as culturally particular
social constructs, their prime function is limited to defining communal
boundaries. </p>

<p>This past summer I taught a graduate course in comparative mysticism at <a href="http://icrs.ugm.ac.id/">University Gadjah Mad</a>a in their <a href="https://crcs.ugm.ac.id/">Center for Religious and Cross-cultural Studies</a> in Yogyakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia. In addition, and maybe more significantly, I spoke at a variety of Islamic colleges (&amp; Christian and Hindu colleges). Indonesia is the 4<sup>th</sup> largest country in the world and it is the largest Islamic country in the world.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The goal was to bring them a knowledge of Judaism in order to clear up misconceptions and to foster a more receptive attitude to Judaism. I was sponsored by Gadjah Mada University and by the AJC-API (American Jewish Committee -Asia Pacific Institute) for the University teaching and sponsored by Gadjah Mada University and the regional Islamic colleges for my important travel to give talks. </p>

<p>University Gadjah Mada is the major center for the study of religion in Indonesia and is the feeder school producing the faculty of the Indonesian Islamic colleges. I stayed in a lovley guest house a mile from the university and walked to work each day down the main shopping avenue. </p>



<p>In my class, I covered contemporary approaches to mysticism such as Michel de Certeau, Jeffrey Kripal, and Amy Hollywood, then the theory was applied to mystical texts from the Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions. &nbsp;I taught a course in mysticism since it complements the Indonesia emphasis on mysticism as a main rubric for self-understanding of their own religion and as an easy way to introduce Judaism into the curriculum since I spent about 40% of the classes discussing Judaism. I was specifically brought to introduce the Judaism into this major graduate program of religion, which because of its status as a feeder school producing MA’s and Phd’s who go into administration and teaching in Islamic colleges. </p>



<p>Indonesia is
predominately an easy-going hybrid Islam oriented more toward local traditions
of the arts and devotion than law. By their own estimates, no more than 25% of
my classroom prayed daily, let alone five times a day. They said it was between
them and God. They said they all fasted during Ramadan but did not go to
prayers. </p>



<p>They like Sufism but
are not into Sufi saints or graves. They read the Sufi mystics Ibn Arabi and
Mulla Sadra about the “unity of being” (waḥdat al-wujūd) in which all of
creation is a manifestation of the divine. But they also accepted as meaningful
to their Indonesia Islam the universal Sufism of the West, including Inayat
Khan, Idries Shah and Robert Frager. This acceptance of western universal Sufism
by Indonesian is similar to going to Monsey NY and finding the Chassidim
reading Buber.</p>



<p>My syllabus included
the Jewish Sufism of Bahye, Ovadiah ben Avraham ben Maimonies, Isaac of Acco,
and Eliyahu deVidas as a bridge topic to show a Judaism that was similar to
their Islam before I turned to the Zohar and Hasidism. We also covered
Christian Kabbalah as a hybrid form of Kabbalah because their own conceptions of
religion are about hybridity. </p>



<p>Indonesia was founded
on the motto of “unity in diversity” and has Pancasila as an official ideology
in which one must accept one God, revelation through a prophet and scripture.
The government has determined that the six official religions that follow this
are Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. It
is a world where Muslim acknowledge Hindus and Buddhists as having one God and
where conversely Hindus and Buddhists see themselves as having one God,
revelation, and scripture. </p>



<p>Pancasila was legally mandated from the founding of the state until 20 years ago. Now, it is still accepted but has many interpretations and variants. How much&nbsp;it is social policy as opposed to theology is debated; one finds explanations of this as a policy of social cohesion and for others it is a liberal and tolerant reading of Islamic theology. The country uses the phrase “God almighty” in official events to refer to all six religions.</p>



<p>The Islamic focus on tawhid-
divine unity remains in place but also includes the other religions. Tribal
religion is treated as culture and folkways- not as theology or religion- so those
practices can be integrated into any of the six. The tribes were basically made
to pick one of the faith for their identity cards, Depending on the region they
chose Christian, Muslim, or Hindu.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Jews are not included in this list anymore since there are not many Jews in Indonesia. They were briefly included at the founding of the state before they emigrated to Australia and the U.S. There is a trend of recent conversions to Judaism clustered in several cities, which deserves its own discussion. (In the meantime, read the two articles <a href="https://azjewishpost.com/2019/48224/">here</a> and <a href="https://azjewishpost.com/2019/indonesia-revisited-synagogue-welcomes-shabbat-visitors/?fbclid=IwAR23d1PPSTIKgNZ-yDLBThxpLYlsm6uJCDQbJ0Z3kH78qqiaNfrTFL6UIR8">here)</a></p>



<p>There are also Muslim
who study Hebrew and Jewish books as Judeophiles. Many of the latter reached
out to me before I arrived when they read the announcement of my arriving. </p>



<p>My own host professor
at the university and co-instructor is one of these Judeophiles. He is Christian,
teaches Judaism, and has been on The Brandeis Schusterman program for Israel
studies. He even translated Heschel&#8217;s <em>The Sabbath</em> into Indonesian and
could not find a publisher because there was no market.</p>



<p>However as I write this,
I note that Americans tend to know little about Indonesia and few college
students study Indonesian. Sufism is a good way to introduce Indonesian Islam
before I speak directly about the Islamic colleges. </p>



<p><strong>Indonesian </strong><strong>Sufism</strong></p>



<p>The East Java city of Kediri is
on the site of an 8th century Hindu city and is now an Islamic factory town,
known as the headquarters of the leading brand of Indonesian cigarettes, mainly
clove cigarettes. When I visited Kediri to speak in an Islamic college, my
hosts graciously took me to the shrine of Sufi Sheykh Sulaiman Al-Wasil
Syamsudin. The shrine is downtown right near the bus station and main hotel
owned by the cigarette company.</p>

<p><br /> In the 12th century, Sheykh Al-Wasil Syamsudin brought Sufism and Islamic teaching to Kediri in East Java from Persia. His Sufism included astrology and fortune-telling. In the 16th century, a Chinese Buddhist style enclosure was built around his tomb with Hindu and Buddhist temple ornamentation. The shire has an actual inscription about his work in old Javanese. The tomb is in the middle of a small graveyard. Around the graveyard is a mosque, community cemetery and concessions for Islamic ritual objects.</p>



<p>When I visited at ten PM
there were only two men reciting Quran as a remembrance of God near the tomb
and another two or three women behind a curtain. There is no set ritual to be
done there. Outside the shrine, there were a few tables with literature from
the various local Sufi organizations who venerate the shrine. Finally, as in
Turkey, there were shops for sweetened Turkish style coffee in glasses.</p>



<p>Around the shrine, one sees
items of the broader syncretic faith of Java. These include a mural of the
Chinese goddess of the sea on the wall of one of the shrine’s building,
Javanese Gamelan instruments, holy water for ritual in the Hindu style., and a
“Cambodian tree” as a place to pray for marriage (like Amukah in the Galilee).
This syncretism is characteristic of traditional Javanese Islam; one that does
not worry about purity, legalism, or other faiths. This syncretism was
important for me to see with my own eyes.</p>



<p>Clifford Geertz, the
important anthropologist, considering true Islam as centered on law (fiqh) based
on his knowledge of Islam in Morocco, and therefore saw Javanese Islam as an
Islamic veneer over Javanese traditional religion. More recent scholars such as
Mark Woodward reverses it and makes Islam as the primary religious category,
which uses the local cultural blend of a Hindu-Buddhist-animist practices as ways
to be Muslim. </p>



<p>Sufism is an alternate
fundamental mode of Islam that is alternative to the version we know based on
law. This is the primary mode of Islam in the Islam of Kediri. The Quran and
Hadith are read in Sufi terms. It is strictly Muslim, in that, Muslims use
Islamic prayer modes and chant Quran, Javanese Hindus and Christians do not.
But Islam is embedded in Javanese culture. For greater detail, consult the
experts on Indonesian Islam who have produced a vast secondary literature.</p>



<p>This Sufi Islam that accepts
the practices of the local Javanese culture is rather mellow, pluralistic,
irenic, and accepting of its cultural setting. In addition, Java also has many
nominal Muslims, without Islamic practice or knowledge. I will talk more about
it when I discusses the colleges that I visited and people I had personal
discussion with about Islam. But it is important to note how mellow is their
tradition flavor of Islam. One of my colleagues at the University, recently
wrote a paper showing how Islam is compatible with animism. A paper that is
border line between empirical observation and creating a progressive 21st
century Islamic political theology that embraces tribal religions. </p>



<p>Since I taught mysticism, I
found out quickly from both my classroom students, and subsequently from
readings, that Indonesian Sufism and mysticism to them is not the sublime
unitive mystical experience of William James or an inner meaning as described by
the classic books on Arabic and Persian Sufism. Rather they used the word
mysticism for any religious experience or connection to religious or ritual
forces. The terms in Indonesia are kebatinan, which in class they used for any religious
experience and kepercayaan for relgious faith. </p>



<p>Ritual done by Sufis is seen
as having powers and blessings. And Sufi leaders, for their followers, have
supernatural powers. People want the blessing (Karamat) and become Sufis. For
Geertz, this was a native Javanese animism with an Islamic veneer and for
current trends it is clearly Islamic Sufism making use of local language and
practices.</p>



<p>There are many Sufi groups in
the city of Kediri. The major groups recruit the male adolescents at the
Islamic boarding schools and are traditional quoting Al Ghazali and requiring
the following of Islamic precepts. However, there are others ranging from those
that include women and children, to those that recruit through social media for
outreach, and there are those that primarily cater to addicts and criminals.
Some allow non-Muslims to attend. Some of them only meet at the shrine and not
in a mosque because the nominal Muslims do not feel comfortable in the
normative in the Mosque.</p>



<p>In general, the Sufi
directive is that everything one does should be for God, “Le- allah” and one
should think of god in all you do. Similar to the parallel concepts in Hasidut
and Neo-Hasidut. According to the books about Kediri Sufism, even for the
traditional groups, they assume if something is not forbidden in the Quran then
it is permitted.</p>



<p>They do not relate to
stringency of later generations. Most of the Sufi groups care little about
later Arabic fatwas or later fiqh. I received similar answers from the Muslim
graduate students in my classroom or local Muslims in Jogja (Yogyakarta). If
you asked them about how they relate to anti-Christian (or Jewish or Hindu)
writings of the medieval ibn Taymiyyah (or other conservative Islamic
thinkers), they answered that it is not Hadith and does not apply to them or
that they are not Salafi so he does not matter.</p>



<p>Finally, I wanted to take my entire University class to a Sufi dhikr or visit a tarikah since as a group of university liberals they had never been. They may have personal theologies based on Ibn Arabi or Mulla Sadra, but no actual pietistic practice or exposure. But my hectic lecturing schedule outside of the university precluded the visit. Next time.<br /> </p>



<p><strong>Islamic Colleges </strong></p>



<p>Besides teaching graduate school at the university, I traveled to speak about Judaism in several Islamic colleges around the country. The goal was to give them familiarity with Judaism. </p>

<p>Many Indonesian attend religious colleges- Christian,
Hindu or Islamic- funded by the state and subject to state supervision. They
are generally BA institutions; students go to the secular universities for
graduate school. The Islamic colleges teach Islam in a college social-science
style. They have a mandatory freshman course in Islamic religion and culture.
The rest of the courses are part of the various majors. A history major can
take history of Islam, a sociology major can take a course on Islamic
sociology, an education major can take courses on Islamic education. Even a
college that has a major in Islamic law, offers courses of a historic-social
nature such as “Rise of the Salafi in the Modern Era.” The overall approach to
their Islam is to rely on the Indonesian tolerant culturally embedded form and
to study in a historic manner.</p>



<p>In some ways, one can compare their Islam to ideas of
a tolerant &#8220;Catholic Israel&#8221; historic form of Judaism with deep
respect for folkways and using their own clear thinking about the classic texts
over the stringent interpretations made in later centuries. The heads of these
Islamic colleges ideally have graduate degrees from places like the center of
religious studies at the secular Gadjah Mada University where I taught. These
deans, and department heads have the responsibility for the formation of a
tolerant Islam in their institutions.</p>



<p>In each Islamic college, I began my talk by
introducing myself and my religious background as a Jewish American, a rabbi,
and a professor. And in each place, I created opening connection by recounting
how the medieval Fatimid traders who originally brought Islam to Indonesia
included Jews among the traders. We have responsa from the Cairo Genizah
permitting wives back home in Egypt to remarry after Indonesian shipwrecks.
Indonesians understood these as analogous to the similar fatwa permitting
remarriage for the Muslim traders. But they also understood that Jews were on
the Fatimid trading ships as part of what Marshall Hodgson called the Islamic
Caliphate; the Jews were part of the diversity of Islamic Egypt in many ways
similar to my culturally belonging to the US.</p>



<p>The first part of the talk was an introduction to
Judaism as similar in structure to Islam in unity of God, prayer, and the other
pillars of Islam. I also showed similarity in dietary practices, circumcision,
and other rituals. Then, I repeated those ideas in a historic manner mentioning
Talmud, hadith, kalam, Maimonides, shaariah, fatwas, responsa and Jewish sufis.</p>



<p>Then, I gave a brief overview of Jews under medieval
Islam, both symbiosis and tension. I included famous contrasts such as the high
that Shmuel Hanagid reached and then the pogrom against his son. I continued
the history briefly survey the decline of the Jewish-Muslim relationship under
colonialism and the rise of nationalism. I transitioned to contemporary
interfaith efforts of Muslim organizations as well as very briefly mentioning
the basic terms of 21st century interfaith and intercommunal relations.</p>



<p>Finally, I concluded with the story of one of my
current Muslim Seton Hall students. He came to the program wanting to know
about interfaith and Christianity, and through the course of his study decided
that he wants to become a professor of Judaism in a Muslim country. He is
currently working on a PhD on medieval Jewish texts. I concluded with his story
as an exhortation for them to encounter Jews and study Judaism.</p>



<p>The students ostensibly know English as part of their
HS and college education, but in all the school I used a translator stopping
after every idea. In the first school, the translator only helped with some
words and summarized a few ideas. By the last school, I sat with the translator
the night before and went over the entire talk.</p>



<p>The content of the talk was not original. It included
the texts from the two chapters on Islam from my book Judaism and World
Religions, articles and handouts from Rabbi Prof Reuven Firestone, and speeches
from Rabbi David Rosen. For the first talk, not knowing what the students would
be interested in discussing in the questions and answers, I brought lots of
pages with me. A whole stack. For the next talk, I just brought the script of
the talk.</p>



<p>The reaction was better than anyone expected. I was
told to anticipate 30-50 students showing up in each school. Instead I had
attendance numbers like 200 in Manado and 160 in Kediri. They were excited
beforehand and afterwards to meet a Jewish scholar. There was sincere
appreciation for opening new vistas. After one of the times that I spoke, a
female student came up to me saying: “You give really good dawah,” using the
Arabic phrase for outreach or calling to God. </p>



<p>They had never heard any of this material before. They
did not really know the basics of Judaism, the history of Jews under Islam, or
met a Jew. In some ways, and I don’t say this to flatter myself, it was like
Swami Vivekananda speaking at the Parliament of World Religions (1893) to introduce
Hinduism, when his audience knew nothing about Hinduism, or at best, just knew
it as paganism. I do not know the stereotypes that they had before the lecture
since there was no before the lecture survey and Jews are not a big topic for
discussion.</p>



<p>I was repeatedly warned to prepare for abrasive
questions from the students about Palestine/Israel. In each case I was told to
brace myself. But these questions never came. Maybe they were just polite.
Maybe I seemed more of a cleric than a politician, the same way one would not
ask a Swami from the Vedanta society about Indian national politics. I assume
that I was perceived as more religious knowledge so no political questions. Or
maybe they themselves do not associate their Islamic practice in anyway with the
politics of Arabia, Pakistan and Syria, or even their own governments actions
to suppress rebellions. Alternately
as one Christian pastor involved in seminary education told me “Israel is a
Christian country”&nbsp;and he did not understand the existence of post-Jesus
Jews.</p>



<p>Instead, I was asked by the students in each school
about the normal concerns of contemporary college students. The questions of
the students were: Judaism and LGBT, Judaism and feminism or woman’s rights, is
internet good for religion, and what is the role of the internet in fostering
peace or violence. They did ask about overcoming social media hatred about
Middle East conflicts. They also asked about Jewish dietary laws and the exact
times of Jewish prayer. They wanted PowerPoint images of Jewish ritual objects,
tallit, tfillin, head coverings, synagogues, Jews from different lands. I
regret not having prepared such a display.</p>



<p>They had little interest in the theological questions of Moses vs Mohamed, or the nature of Jewish scripture, or even Quranic passages. They already have a basic respect and tolerance for other faiths as part of their curriculum.</p>

<p><br /> Since the Indonesian constitution states that &#8220;the nation is based upon belief in one supreme God.&#8221; The first tenet of the country&#8217;s national ideology, Pancasila, declares a required belief in one God, revelation and scripture, which is fulfilled by accepting Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Confucianism. There would be an automatic sense that we all worship one God and one sticks to one’s tradition. This basic equivalence of faiths as political theology allows them to easily add Judaism to their accepted religions. They have all studied this in high school as part of civics or civil religion.</p>



<p>The Islamic colleges seek to go beyond the mandated
course and offer a required course in world religions as part of their goal of
creating a tolerant Islam. They actively dismiss the hardline exclusive
readings of Islam produced in other countries. So, my audiences knew something
about Judaism from the chapters in introductions to world religions books of
Huston Smith and Ninian Smart. Those 1960’s classics present Judaism as
essentialized, without medieval history, and as a religion outside politics.
They have the other world faiths discussed in Ninian Smart in Indonesia, so I
was the novelty of meeting a believer in faith they never met before.</p>



<p>There are few books in Indonesian exclusively on
Judaism, some of the few books available are <em>Abba Eban, My People </em>and a
work by a Dutch Christian. This Fall 2019, one of the Islamic colleges will be
introducing a new course focusing on Judaism. I have a copy of the textbook
that the teacher produced; it builds on the categories of Ninian Smart. I also
met students who are studying Hebrew and came to the event in t-shirts embossed
with Shalom in Hebrew.</p>



<p>After each talk, I would be surrounded by dozens of
students wanting to take a selfie with me. Indonesia is a very big Instagram
country. There are hundreds of pictures on Instagram of me with young female in
a jilbab (Indonesian name for hijab) students. The jilbabs are an interested
facet of Indonesian Islamic life. They were generally not worn in the 1980’s
and returned in the 21st century as part of the self-identity of the younger
generation. The head covering by the young generation absolutely drives crazy
many of the baby boomer age Muslims who feel their children are getting too
religious. Yet, this young generation is more educated, open, and tolerant. </p>



<p>There is a vast literature on how the young feel the
jilbab is essential to their Islam and how at the same time they are more
likely than the previous generation to write dissertations on eco-feminism or
greater feminist rights. Part of the current acceptance of the jilbab is that
they are now in bright colors, vivid patterns and serve as bold fashion
accessories. More than half of my graduate classroom was female. From what I
hear, that is a major change from 15 years ago. </p>



<p>On the other hand, most of these same women wanted to shake my hand and then put their arm around me for the selfie. I asked many of them: Is touching a member of the opposite sex permitted. I have been in other Muslim counties where it clearly was not permitted, even in non-Salafi ones. Each woman gave the same basic answer. “We are not Salafi” so we touch. Salafi functions as a pejorative in the language of the college students for those too strict in the law or those who invoke a fatwa made in the Arab lands. They have their own identity as traditional Indonesian Muslims.</p>

<p><strong>What about Salafi Islam? Isn’t it taking
over?</strong></p>



<p>Some of my readers may remember that Bali was bombed in
2002 by Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamist group. &nbsp;But the government has been banning,
imprisoning, and expelling radical Islamic forces. Those convicted in relation
to the bombings were sentenced to death. </p>



<p>On the other hand, the NYT considers the younger generation
of feminists and phd students who wear a jilbob as a right-wing turn. However,
it is a truism around the world that the younger generation of Orthodox of any
faith who are more educated than their parents have a greater return to textual
practice as part a transition from traditionalism to a text-based religion. And
Indonesia has had religious parties that have wanted more Islam in the country since
it founding 1945, but they want an Indonesia Islam. </p>



<p>Recently, there was a wonderful article by Muhammad
Sani Umar &amp;&nbsp; Mark Woodward, “The
Izala effect: unintended consequences of Salafi radicalism in Indonesia and
Nigeria” in Contemporary Islam. In the article they “argue that the Salafi
religious and cultural agendas are incompatible with Islam as understood by a
vast majority of Muslims in these regions.” They see the extreme Islam as inauthentic
compared to their version. The Salafi seek to ban the cultural Sufi world of
poetry, music, performance and that drives the Indonesian to totally reject the
Salafi. &nbsp;The Salafi want to introduce
Arabic culture and people are proud of their Indonesian culture, so the Salafi
are obviously false. They show that Indonesians associate all forms of Salafi-
Wahhabism with violence and terrorism.</p>



<p>To return the opening discussion of how does
Indonesian Islam accept Hinduism and Confucianism as a unified monotheistic God
of tawhid. Indonesians study the Sufi mystics Ibn Arabi and Mulla Sadra who are
monists and &nbsp;define tawhid as the “unity
of being” (waḥdat al-wujūd) that denies an ontological distinction between
Allah and creation because all of it pre-existed in the mind of Allah prior to
the moment of creation. All of creation is a manifestation of the divine; we experience
the divine in all things. Since &nbsp;Salafis reject these propositions, then from
an Indonesian perspective they do not have the proper Islamic worldview.&nbsp; </p>



<p>My students certainly had these mystical perspectives
and their parents certainly went to Sufi shrines. Hence, they are compelled to
reject Salafis. Arabic beards and robes do not make the Muslim, rather the
unity of God in the heart. </p>



<p>Plato, in the Republic wrote &#8220;when modes of music
change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them.&#8221; Here
the converse is true. The Indonesian commitment to Gamelan music and ritual
performances &nbsp;means the extremism is not
accepted. I am not an ethnomusicologist and did not pay the same attention to
music as to religion. However, gamelan music is taught to children. People told
me that their relatives taught it to them as children or they went to Sunday
school for gamelan music. &nbsp;One Sunday morning,
standing before an open-side building design, I watched such a class for 30
kids. I even met some American ex-pats who were sending their girl &#8211; age six to
the Sunday gamelan class. People shows off to me that they could play. But
outside of the classes or special festivals and events, I heard little of it on
any island. Even the masjid in Kediri had a set up for playing gamelan music in
the mosque. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, yes, 2019 Indonesia is stricter than
1999 Indonesia. Alcohol and porn are banned on Java as an act of upholding Islamic
values- but that does not mean they want other aspects of the law or the
undoing of religious diversity. </p>



<p>Do not confuse Java with Aech on the northern tip of
Sumatra, which follows Sharia. I did not visit it and it functions, in many
ways, as its own region. I also was not in Papua or the Maluku islands. </p>



<p>In addition, do not confuse Islamic popularism in
politics with Islam as a religion. Indonesia has its share of Islamic versions
of Naftali Bennett, Ayelet Shaked, and Bezalel Smotrich, below the threshold
but making lots of noise. But they are not Bnai Brak Haredim, so too the
Islamic popularists are not Haredim. </p>



<p>For example, there is preacher at as a masjid on/near
the campus of University Gadjah Mada who advocates an ethno-national Islam of
wanting to exclude Christians and Hindus from teaching and living together, but
it has little connection to Islamic observance or knowledge of Islam. The same
ethno-nationals may not pray Islamic prayers or follow Islamic law. It mainly attracts
the formerly secular and those in the natural sciences. The strictly observant Muslims
are products of Islamic boarding schools and are more politically tolerant than
these ethno-nationals. The University’s administration counters the
ethno-national Islam by giving greater voice to the graduates of the Islamic
boarding school system who can read Arabic and know the Islamic religion. </p>



<p>Finally, seventeen years ago in 2002, was the last
time the university had a visiting professor of Judaism, Rebecca T. Alpert of
Temple U. In her own account of her time in Indonesia, she remarked how people
thought she was crazy to go to a Muslim country. Now, it is common to meet fellow
ex-pat Jews in Dubai, in Turkey, and elsewhere. Also she notes how she learned
of how the Biblical stories are portrayed in the Quran in this visit. Now there
are Jewish professors of Islam and Christianity as well as Muslim and Christian
professors of Judaism. The age of globalization creates a field of greater
travel for interfaith work, and in the 21<sup>st</sup> century there is greater
Jewish-Islamic encounter and knowledge of one another. My trip did not have the surprise element
but is all part of today’s interfaith work. <br />
