				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In the comments section on the post about the limits of Yoga for Jews, Avi Solomon, a reader of this blog, posted that as a Jew from Mumbai India he knew that Indian Jews knew how to keep a distance. (He is the author of a <a href="http://avisolo.blogspot.com">blog  avisolo.blogspot</a> that mainly discusses Abulafia and technical writing.)  Since he has firsthand knowledge of Jewish practice in India, I decided to ask him a few questions and then a few more questions. I wanted to learn how they keep a distance and where they put the lines.</p>
<p>Please treat him and his answers with respect. We don’t need to point out where the practice among Indian Jewry is different than the Rambam, Rama or Pithei Teshuvah. Nor should we correct him with hindsight. The goal is to ask what can we learn from the natural practices of Indian Jewry.</p>
<p>When I posted on Yoga and Judaism, it was during Diwali. I was receiving many emails wishing me a happy Diwali. So the first thing I asked was concerning the holiday.  </p>
<p><strong>How did Jews relate to Diwali? Did they give greeting? Go out to the festivities?</strong></p>
<p>We participated (along with members of every religion) in setting off very loud firecrackers! We greeted the Hindus when socially appropriate but attended any Diwali festivities only if we were invited. We told them we have our Diwali too -Hanukkah, which usually came a week or two after Diwali.</p>
<p><strong>Which holidays did the Jews avoid?</strong></p>
<p>None really. All holidays were an social occasion to meet the Goyim or to do excursions together as a (Jewish) family. This included the [Muslim] Id festivals too.</p>
<p><strong>What were some of the things forbidden as Avodah Zara in India?</strong></p>
<p>Never bow down to an Idol or at any place of worship that was not a synagogue. We somehow knew instinctively when we were about to cross a line.</p>
<p><strong>How much did Jews know about Indian religions, its practice, and its Gods?</strong></p>
<p>A lot &#8211; we were neighbors and Mumbai is a very cramped place.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything noticeable that was allowed?</strong></p>
<p>Stuff to do with protection from ayin hara. For example a lemon with seven chillies would hang from the main door under the mezuzah as &#8220;additional protection&#8221;; or breaking coconuts on various occasions to ward off ayin ha ra.<br />
Some religious customs were adopted from the Goyim but thoroughly koshered, for example the &#8220;Malida&#8221; ceremony honoring our &#8220;patron saint&#8221; Eliyahu HaNavi:<br />

Shirley Berry Isenberg&#8217;s classic book &#8220;India&#8217;s Bene Israel&#8221; has more info.</p>
<p><strong>Did you model yourself on the Muslims?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. The Jews were there a lot before the Muslims and there was always some tension with the Muslims. The positive model to aspire to in India were the Zoroastrians (Parsis) who are ironically called the &#8220;Jews of India&#8221;. In fact my family lived next doors to a Zoroastrian family and our house overlooked a fire temple.</p>
<p><strong>How did Jews relate to Zoroastrianism?</strong></p>
<p>Congenially &#8211; Zoroastrianism was closer to the Jews as they worship an invisible God albeit made present in the form of fire and there was a sense of companionship as  Zoroastrians were fellow &#8220;exiles&#8221; in India even after being there for a few thousand years. Also the Zoroastrians/Parsis were the most cosmopolitan Indians and the Indian Jews (Bene Israel) of Bombay naturally gravitated towards the same middle class status as them.</p>
<p>See the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120848">&#8216;Such a Long Journey&#8217;</a> for an intimate portrayal of the Zoroastrian life in Bombay.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239795">&#8216;Percy&#8217;</a> is also good but difficult to find.</p>
<p><strong>How did you relate to  the fire temple?</strong></p>
<p>It was off limits to any non-Zoroastrian. I was able to sneak in once as a kid with my Parsi neighbor friend. Don&#8217;t tell anybody. 🙂</p>
<p><strong>What were the boundaries with Zoroastrians?</strong></p>
<p>None apart from not bowing down to their prophet.</p>
<p><strong>Was it different than Hinduism?</strong></p>
<p>No. Will all religions the boundary was not bowing down before their Gods (you could go into their places of worship if you wished and they allowed). The other boundaries were not marrying goyim or eating non-kosher meat. Of course there were some Indian Jews who crossed these lines and paid prices. For young Jews the solution was usually to immigrate to Israel to find a Jewish partner. When the community is down to 5000 it&#8217;s hard to find someone suitable.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know of any writings on how actual Jews related to Indian religions? (Besides Nathan Katz)</strong></p>
<p>Mostly fiction (Shirley Berry Isenberg&#8217;s non-fiction book <a href="http://India's Bene Israel: A Comprehensive Inquiry and Sourcebook [Hardcover]">India&#8217;s Bene Israel: A Comprehensive Inquiry and Sourcebook</a> [Hardcover] is the best factual accounts):<br />
<em>Shulamith</em> by Meera Mahadevan (hard to find &#8211; movingly shows that Indian Jewish life was not all hunky dory)<br />
<a href="http://estherdavid.com/books.html">Esther David</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baumgartners-Bombay-Anita-Desai/dp/0618056807">&#8220;Baumgartner&#8217;s Bombay&#8221;</a> is a unique fictional account of a German Jew who ended up in Bombay just before the war and stayed there.</p>
<p>There is an online <a href="http://www.jewsofindia.org/community_forum.html">Jews of India forum.</a></p>
<p>These documentaries on the Bene Israel might be useful:</p>
<p>See, brandeis.edu/jewishfilm/Catalogue/films/beneisrael.htm</p>

<p><strong>Were there any rabbis- or hakhamim who were stricter? (I wanted to know if anyone followed the way it is discussed in the poskim.)</strong></p>
<p>Not that I know of &#8211; most of the strictness was in setting a personal example of high levels of observances.</p>

				<p>This article by Adam Jacobs of Aish presents Sefer Yetzirah as an ancient esoteric wisdom of different forms of energy and states of consciousness, useful for our secular lives.  The way this shell game works is to draw equal signs between different things and not worry about whether the associations works. Sefer Yetzirah= 32 states of consciousness= Huxley on altered states of consciousness= right-brain left brain pop psych= Freud= Chabad modernization of chochma and bina. As one commenter put it “where are the other 30 states and how do you actually attain them.</p>
<p>Aish usually likes the esotericism of creating a gematria to artificially connect a Zohar to modern psychology, implying we have from Sinai a deeper well of contemporary pop psych than the secular world. This one caught my eye because of the scientology or Kabbalah Centre language of guidebook, harness, tools, and benefit.  It is a “guidebook that explains the tools and techniques.”  I wonder which traditional commentaries is he reading? Notice also the lack of for its lack of reference to God.</p>
<p>People have always said that those who know kabbalah should offer something to compete with the Kabbalah Centre. American academics say that we should teach them to read Zohar and understand it as myth, symbols, and history. But that isn’t useful tools and techniques. Chabad teaches about your neshoma and your connection to God.. But is also not an esoteric guidebook to manipulate the world. Now, we have  Aish giving the world what it wants: a Da Vinci Code that will make your material life better. </p>
<p>What makes this article even more interesting is that Irwin Kula of CLAL showed up in the comments in order to call Adam Jacob&#8217;s bluff. Kula states that &#8220;traditional people like to imagine that the latest science is in the ancient texts. Kula then calls on Jacobs to get beyond the gobbeldy gook and admit that if one is interested in these topics then read the scientific literature. Kula asks Jacobs the empirical question of whether religion offers any teachings about any states of consciousness. </p>
<blockquote><p>Rabbi Adam Jacobs<br />
Managing Director, Aish Center in Manhattan Posted: November 7, 2010 &#8211; <a href="http:///www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-adam-jacobs/the-32-types-of-conscious_b_779128.html#comments">Full Version Here</a><br />
The most ancient (and still used) text of the Kabbalah is called the Sefer Yetzirah or Book of Formation, and its contents are generally attributed to the Biblical patriarch Abraham. The book opens with a discussion of the &#8220;32 Mystical Paths of Wisdom,&#8221; paths derived from the 10 digits on our hands (quantity) plus the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which we use to construct language and thereby describe reality (quality). These paths are also reflected in the 10 sefirot &#8212; spheres of energy that are the building blocks of physical reality yet also relate to character traits as well as states of consciousness:</p>
<p>The Sefer Yetzirah is a guidebook that explains the tools and techniques that are required to enter these states. One important (and practical) distinction that we can all make and relate to concerns the states of chochma (expansive subconsciousness) and binah (the conscious mind). Long ago, the Kabbalah knew that creativity was housed in the right brain and analytical thought in the left. Freud and Jung were familiar with these kabbalistic works and borrowed heavily from them (as did Newton and others). </p>
<p>Therefore, we are all familiar with these two states of being. Chochma is what we experience when we are at our creative best &#8212; when we are in &#8220;the zone&#8221; and experiencing a natural, easy flow. Artists, musicians and other creative people know it well and they also know that they are able to achieve, channel and create in that space in ways that would be impossible in normal waking life. Chochma is not concerned with life&#8217;s practicalities </p>
<p> Chochma is the dimension where, as Aldous Huxley wrote, &#8220;we see the world as it truly is &#8230; infinite&#8221;. He also said that in order to do that, the &#8220;doors of perception&#8221; needed to be cleansed. The Torah is the instruction manual that guides us along that path.</p>
<p>Binah is our analytical, practical and down-to-earth state. One that is useful for accounting, problem solving, computer programming, paying bills on time and the like. It is grounded and practical and has the ability to take the inspiration from chochma and &#8220;make it real&#8230;Though useful, binah does not always bring us to tranquility, harmony and big picture thinking. </p>
<p>For a stunning, impactful and crystal clear example of what I&#8217;m describing, have a look at this video of Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, a brain scientist describing the effects of a stroke that shut down her left brain. What she describes is simply pure chochma consciousness in its most distilled form as her binah was completely switched off. It&#8217;s as beautiful as it is astounding. This is the state that the Sefer Yetzirah is teaching us to access, and there are wondrous benefits available to all those who succeed in harnessing and bonding these two great powers of the mind.</p></blockquote>
<p> The right left brain version of <a href="http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380431/jewish/Right-and-Left-Brain-Activity.htm">Chabad seems traceable to a source like this.</a></p>
<p>Jacobs seems inspired by secular new age works like this <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Personal-Kabbalah-Paths-Inner-Purpose/dp/0806958987">Personal Kabbalah: 32 Paths to Inner Peace and Life Purpose</a></em></p>
<blockquote><p>I recommend this book if you&#8217;re looking for personal and professional success and fulfillment. It not only explains ancient wisdom in non-religious, contemporary, practical terms, it also gives you methods for accomplishment. The techniques in this book work for personal use as well as business.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a good thing that Jacobs speaks as the authentic tradition. Image where he would be if he could innovate. As one commenter put it- &#8220;this makes Scientology believable&#8221;. Kula grasps the important point is that one readers of this pseudo-scientific religion dont really want a deep understanding because if they did they would read popular science. The question that Kula does not ask is:Why are people satisfied with this? Why are the successful MBA&#8217;s, that he gives private classes to at 10K each, happy with this?</p>
<p>Rabbi Irwin Kula comments </p>
<blockquote><p>I really do appreciate both the creativity of your response and its precision-quite an example of integrating chochmah and binah- which is nothing more than an ancient language for what we know as right brain and left brain. Traditional people often like to see contemporary scientific discoveries hinted at in their past traditions as it gives them a sense that their religious inheritance is really smart especially as it is becoming irrelevant to increasing numbers of people.</p>
<p>But forgetting about the gobbeldy gook of all this (which you point out quite humorously) especially when you can actually get a far deeper understanding of both chocmah and binah from reading Daniel Pink and other neuroscientists I have a question for you. And forget about the god stuff and the esoteric theological language that presumes all this is true in some metaphysical way, do you think there are a variety of levels/ states of consciousness that we have access to or can experience that can be parsed/explained with enough detail that we can recognize them. In other words besides asleep and awake are there other levels of awareness (making no metaphysical claim about them) that give us insight into ourselves/our world that are worth trying to attain. And last do you think there is a possibility that &#8211; admittedly in an inaccessible language and often crudely &#8211; ancient wisdoms happened upon some of those states and tried to record them in ways that might help us understand them better.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Irwin</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>This past August, Professor Marshall Breger organized an unprecedented mission to the death camps at Dachau and Auschwitz led by Rabbi Jack Bemporad for eight influential Imams. The reactions were life-changing.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>At the end of the service, prayer leader Muzammil Siddiqi, imam of the Islamic Society of Orange County, California, offered up an additional prayer: “We pray to God that this will not happen to the Jewish people or to any people anymore.”</p>
<p>Siddiqi was one of eight American Muslim leaders on a study tour to Dachau and Auschwitz that was co-sponsored by a German think tank and the Center for Interreligious Understanding, a New Jersey-based interfaith dialogue group. The delegation’s sole female member was Laila Muhammad, daughter of the late American Muslim leader W.D. Muhammad and granddaughter of Elijah Muhammad, the late leader of the Nation of Islam.</p>
<p>The unusual trip was the brainchild of Marshall Breger, an Orthodox Jew and a Republican who served as a senior official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Breger, who wore his yarmulke on every leg of the trip, said he first had the idea of organizing the expedition last year, while he was in Israel during the visit of Pope Benedict XVI. He described it simply as a kind of eureka moment.</p>
<p>“There is a view that there is growing anti-Semitism in the Muslim world, reinforced by people like President [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad, that there is growing Holocaust denial in the Muslim world,” explained Breger, now a law professor at Catholic University. “In light of that, the idea was to offer education to those who might not have the kind of knowledge that we’ve had about World War II and the Jewish community, and to do this in a public way.”</p>
<p>It is impossible to know what the long-term impact of such a trip will be. But if the heartfelt comments of the trip participants — including some with a history of previous statements that many Jews view as problematic — are any guide, Breger did not underestimate the value of direct experience in promoting education, understanding and even, perhaps, change.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was not hard to imagine that some of the Muslim delegates might be viewed as imperfect candidates for dialogue by Jews wary of discussions with those they see as Islamists or as prone to extremist views.</p>
<p>Emerging from the crematorium at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the delegates signed a memorial book. One of the inscriptions, from Sayyid M. Syeed, an interfaith activist, read, “For Muslims to see the Holocaust is an overwhelming experience.” It went on to quote a verse in the Quran stating that though man was created by God in excellent form, he is capable of becoming the lowest of the low.</p>
<p>In some of their most sensitive discussions, several delegates grappled with the issue of how to present the truth of the Holocaust in a way that would be accepted and taken to heart by their congregants. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/130013/">Full Article in the Forward- here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Statement of Muslim American Imams and Community Leaders on Holocaust Denial</p>
<p>‘O you who believe, stand up firmly for justice as witnesses to Almighty God.” (Holy Qu’ran, al-Nisa “The Women” 4:135)</p>
<p>On August 7-11, 2010, we the undersigned Muslim American faith and community leaders visited Dachau and Auschwitz concentration camps where we witnessed firsthand the historical injustice of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>We met survivors who, several decades later, vividly and bravely shared their horrific experience of discrimination, suffering, and loss. We saw the many chilling places where men, women and children were systematically and brutally murdered by the millions because of their faith, race, disability and political affiliation.</p>
<p>In Islam, the destruction of one innocent life is like the destruction of the whole of humanity and the saving of one life is like the saving of the whole of humanity (Holy Qu’ran, al-Ma’idah “the Tablespread” 5:32). While entire communities perished by the many millions, we know that righteous Muslims from Bosnia, Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, and Albania saved many Jews from brutal repression, torture and senseless destruction.</p>
<p>We bear witness to the absolute horror and tragedy of the Holocaust where over twelve million human souls perished, including six million Jews.</p>
<p>We condemn any attempts to deny this historical reality and declare such denials or any justification of this tragedy as against the Islamic code of ethics.</p>
<p>We condemn anti-Semitism in any form. No creation of Almighty God should face discrimination based on his or her faith or religious conviction.</p>
<p>We stand united as Muslim American faith and community leaders and recognize that we have a shared responsibility to continue to work together with leaders of all faiths and their communities to fight the dehumanization of all peoples based on their religion, race or ethnicity. With the disturbing rise of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred, rhetoric and bigotry, now more than ever, people of faith must stand together for truth.</p>
<p>Together, we pledge to make real the commitment of “never again” and to stand united against injustice wherever it may be found in the world today.</p>

				<p>Sometime this week, <a href="../../../../2010/09/13/half-shabbos/index.html">the original post on half-shabbos</a> and the squeal on <a href="../../../../2010/11/03/half-shabbos-again/index.html">&#8220;half- shabbos again&#8221;</a> became my all-time most read post. Why?<br />
It is not novel. People already know about these things. Was it just the web effect of going viral? Is it the sensationalism of peering behind a door? Were educators and rabbis really unaware? Was it the name &#8220;half-shabbos&#8221;? Was it just because it talked about the community and not ideas?</p>
<p>My runner-up biggest posts are on Rav Kook, Rav Amital, Kugel, Green, Riskin, Sacks, and post-orthodoxy &#8212;each of these posts had content not found elsewhere. Therefore, I understand why they received many readers. The Riskin post was my third biggest post without any links or discussions on other sites and without going viral, just because I was the only one who covered the topic.<br />
But half-shabbos?? An overheard fragment. Really! Thoughts on why?</p>

				<p>There is a Jewish or Orthodox parallel somewhere. It sounds familial.  There is something to take note of here. But the similar Jewish debates do not immediately spring to mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bishops Play Defense On Anti-Poverty Initiative </p>
<p>(RNS) For four decades, the U.S. Catholic bishops have maintained a nationwide program designed to help the poor lift themselves out of poverty. And for just as long, fierce critics have tried to kill it.</p>
<p>Proponents of the Catholic Campaign on Human Development (CCHD) say it exemplifies Jesus&#8217; preference for the poor and downtrodden; opponents, including several bishops, say it funds left-wing activists, some of whom undermine church doctrine on homosexuality and abortion.</p>
<p>As the U.S. bishops&#8217; flagship anti-poverty program, the CCHD is funded through a special collection taken up each year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. Since 1970, the program has disbursed $290 million in grants, according to CCHD officials.</p>
<p>But the program&#8217;s practices and guiding philosophy have been sharply attacked by conservatives armed with Internet-enhanced research, a sharp nose for malfeasance, and a deep apprehension for anything that sniffs of socialism.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Someone told me a story of how they were at a wedding last year, and that during the course of dinner the head of a major Modern Orthodox institution told a Rosh Yeshiva that he does not smile enough. One should always be smiling. I have nothing against smiling, I do it often myself. But there was something interesting in this post on another blog that made me think of that wedding story. Here are selections from the other blog&#8217;s 12 points. It reminds me how hard it is to speak of Navardok today.</p>
<blockquote><p>2. In the Protestant West today, smiling has become a moral imperative. The smile is regarded as the objective externalization of a well ordered life. Sadness is moral failure.</p>
<p>3. The motif of late-capitalist society is the stylization of happiness, the cultivation of lifestyles from which every trace of sadness has been expunged. Peter Berger identified ‘the Protestant smile’ as part of Protestantism’s cultural heritage in the West. In a Catholic country like France, it is still considered crass to smile too often, or at strangers. Evangelical churchliness is the re-utilization of bare-toothed crassness. Our cultural obsession with health, happiness, and positive thinking is a secularization of the evangelical church service.</p>
<p>4. The cultural triumph of the smile leaves behind a trail of casualties. Where evangelical churches theologize happiness and ritualized the smile, sad believers are spiritually ostracized. Sadness is the scarlet letter of the contemporary church, embroidered proof of a person&#8217;s spiritual failure. </p>
<p>5. When the church’s theological rejection of sadness was secularized, sadness became a pathology requiring medical intervention. The medicalization of sadness is the final cultural triumph of the Protestant smile. If Luther or Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky had lived today, we would have given them Prozac and schooled them in positive thinking. They would have grinned abortively – and written nothing. The truth of sadness is the womb of thought.<br />
.<br />
8. I know a fellow who was interviewed for ordination in an American denomination. Asked to describe his hope for the church’s future, his eyes filled with tears and he admitted, ‘I don’t know if I have any hope for the church.’ Perplexed by this response, his ecclesiastical interviewers furrowed their brows, scribbled little notes and question-marks, conferred gravely about his fitness for ministry – though they ought to have asked for his prayers, or poured oil on his head, or sat at his feet and made him their bishop. </p>
<p>9. Where sadness is expunged from a culture, the cry for justice falls silent. Johnny Cash carried darkness on his back, refusing to wear bright clothes as long as the world is unredeemed. Why do we dress our priests in black? Are they not in perpetual mourning for a world that is passing away? Is not Christian joy carried out in the shadow of this sadness? In a culture of happiness, it is all the more necessary that our priests continue to dress in black, refusing the cheap comfort of bright vestments and the empty promise of the rainbow. </p>
<p>10. At the turn of the millennium, J. G. Ballard wondered how the next generation would perceive the 20th century: ‘My grandchildren are all under the age of four, the first generation who will have no memories of the present century, and are likely to be appalled when they learn what was allowed to take place. For them, our debased entertainment culture and package-tour hedonism will be inextricably linked to Auschwitz and Hiroshima, though we would never make the connection.’ How do we explain the fact that Auschwitz and Hiroshima are immediately succeeded by the cult of happiness and the triumph of the smile? How can it be that the worst century was also the happiest? Our children will interpret our happiness as blindness and self-forgetfulness. We have drugged ourselves against history; sadness is truthful memory. </p>
<p>12. The Bible promises the end of history and the end of sadness…This can be understood as eschatological promise only on the presumption that history is catastrophe, a vale of tears. Sadness is overcome through cosmic redemption. A culture without sadness is a culture without hope. The cure for sadness is God.</p>

				<p>I once had a student attempt a cultural analysis of Bat Ayin. Here we have a sociological article on the topic. Her example of dredlock peyot in a good catch,but I wish there the article had a thicker description, in the Geertz sense.</p>
<p>Joanna Steinhardt, <em>American Neo-Hasids in the Land of Israel</em> Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, Volume 13, Issue 4, (2010) pages 22–42,</p>
<p><em>Some wore a blend of Eastern-style clothes, such as Thai fisherman pants, open-collared Indian shirts and embroidered vests; others wore baggy pants and T-shirts like any other American youth. The women wore long flowing skirts and dresses, multilayered over loose pants, with colorful tunics, scarves and shawls. The young Americans were demonstrative in their piety, uninhibited and enthusiastic in their adherence to Jewish law, and youthful and informal in their behavior.</p>
<p>At parties they sat on the floor in a circle playing acoustic guitars and drums, singing Hasidic songs, drinking and smoking&#8230;Their speech was interspersed with Yiddish exclamations—Mamesh! Gevaltic!—that took some time for me to decode.</p>
<p>These young people seemed to embody a unique variation on mystical religious Zionism, which mingled American counterculture with a primordial philosophy of the Jewish people’s tie to their ethnic-spiritual homeland, the Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p>In my fieldwork, I sought to understand better how American countercultural discourse provides an ideological bridge to Zionist Orthodox Judaism. In this case, I found that the countercultural discourse, with its particular construction of “spirituality,” disrupted the familiar right-left political continuum in Israel by exhibiting both progressive and reactionary political features.</p>
<p>My fieldwork began with in-depth interviews in 2005 and 2006 of students at Yeshivat Chesed V’emet (CV), located twenty minutes outside Jerusalem in the settlement of Bat Ayin&#8230; Although Gush Etzion is known for its suburban atmosphere, Bat Ayin is more akin to the extremist settlements deeper in the West Bank. Yitzchak Ginsburgh helped found the settlement with his students—a mix of American and Russian immigrants and native Israelis, the majority ba’alei teshuvah—in 1989.</p>
<p>When I told secular Israelis that I was interviewing people in Bat Ayin, their immediate association was the story of the Bat Ayin cell.<br />
Beyond this public association with political violence, the culture and policy of the settlement reflect extremist attitudes in relation to the Palestinian Arab population and the claimed right of the Jewish people to the biblical land of Israel. Bat Ayin has long maintained a ban on Arabs working in the community and, more recently, a total ban on Arabs in the community for any reason. While this antagonism is indicative of settlers’ attitudes in general, Bat Ayin is extreme in its relatively lawless militancy.</p>
<p>I was told that the surrounding Arab villagers refer to the Bat Ayin settlers as “the crazies.”  As many students noted, the proximity to “nature” was a key ingredient in their positive experience at the yeshiva. In a similar vein, the simple and rugged lifestyle is conducive to introspection. On a more complex level, I sense that the political extremism and marginalization of the settlement also appeal to these yeshiva students, but only to the degree that these qualities reflect the values of anarchism, radicalism, and self-sufficiency and an underlying mystical vision—even though the same students may be uncomfortable with the racism or violence that results from these same values and ideas.</p>
<p>At first I dressed in T-shirts and skirts that hit below the knee (a typical Modern Orthodox look), but I noticed that some of these interviews had the subtle atmosphere of a date coordinated by a matchmaker for religious singles. In the next few interviews, I wore jeans and found that the date atmosphere quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>Since I was interested in the reach and influence of CV, Yeshivat Shirat HaTorah (ST) was a logical extension of my research.</p>
<p>For example, students cited 1960s counterculture books, authors and iconic figures, such as Carlos Castaneda’s The Teachings of Don Juan (1968) and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932), as well as writings by Timothy Leary, the Beat poets, William Blake and others. Independently of each other, four CV students cited Ken Kesey as an influential figure in their youth. “Read that book,” said Aharon, referring to The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe’s journalistic account of Kesey and his LSD-dropping crew, the Merry Pranksters&#8230; </p>
<p>Nearly every interviewee had been part of the countercultural milieu that includes subcultural successors to the 1960s hippie movement—Rainbow Gatherings, Grateful Dead and Phish concerts, raves, radical environmentalism, Neopaganism, anti-globalization activism, and other youth subcultures. Students from this milieu shared a particular construction of spirituality associated with the New Age movement and an antagonism toward mainstream society.</p>
<p>Yonatan cut off his dreadlocks but left two above his ears as peot hanging down to his chest in long s-shaped curves under his knit kippa. In this way, CV and ST students created a syncretistic material culture linking countercultural styles with innovative religious ones.</p>
<p>American Neo- Hasidism in Israel, as practiced at Chesed V’Emet and Shirat HaTorah, is a syncretistic revival of traditional Judaism that uses American countercultural expressions to give meaning to Jewish practice and identity.</em></p>
