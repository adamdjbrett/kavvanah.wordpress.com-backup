				<p>As of this week, I return to regular blogging. I thank everyone who contacted me wondering where I was. A few points before we resume our regularly scheduled programming.</p>
<p>1] Due to recent events, comments will no longer be allowed from an unknown email or IP addresses. You can remain with an anonymous screen name such as EJ or IH, but you need a verifiable email and IP addresses corresponding to a person known on the web. No more malinator email accounts and no phony emails. I will not place an ID program on the blog. Just give me an email that I can google to verify with a matching IP. (I understand if you have a separate IP for home and work.) If you need to explain yourself, then do it in the line for URL. I already have a stable IP address and email for many of you but for those whom I don’t, you will need to start using one. Don’t take it personally.</p>
<p>2] It appears that the majority of my readers are not reading the posts in real time. They are noting the articles that they want to return to read and then returning on the weekend or in later weeks. People use Pocket (nee Read It Later) and other programs to mark the article to return to read. I get spikes on a post two weeks after posting. Hence, comments are no indication of number of people reading a post. It also means that people like longer posts so they can treat them as magazine articles.</p>
<p>3] I would like guest bloggers to fill in some of my time away. If anyone is interested and has material appropriate to this blog, then let me know.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://www.theapj.com/symposium-on-jewish-bioethics/">An online discussion</a> had a wonderful post by the important Jewish Medical Ethicist, Alan Jotkowitz MD. In the post he gives five programmatic directions for the future of medical ethics. Some are statements of his different starting points and others are open questions  (1) To recognize the lack of precedents for Jewish medical ethics and its reliance on aggadah and Jewish thought. (2) To encourage that it serve as a source for the general ethical discussion. (3) We  need a greater recognition of the role of patient autonomy is needed, similar to Western medical ethics. This goes with a lesser rabbinic presence. (4) Does the lack of consensus undercut the discipline? (5)There is a greater need to focus on the sources of confession and death bed to develop an ethic of empathy and altruism. I hope he finds time to write a book soon.</p>
<p>His approach breaks the denominational and legalistic straitjacket of the field in the last twenty years. I discussed some of these issues when I posted on Immanuel Jacobovits <a href="../../../../2012/11/28/rabbi-immauel-jakobovits-and-the-loss-of-the-deathbed/index.html">here</a> and <a href="../../../../2012/11/12/rabbi-immanuel-jakobovits-and-christiaan-barnard/index.html">here. </a></p>
<p><b>A Dialogue on Jewish Medical Ethics &#8211; Alan Jotkowitz MD,  </b></p>
<p><b>Associate Professor of Medicine, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheva, Israel</b></p>
<p>There has been an explosion in interest in Jewish Medical Ethics since the publication of Lord Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits monumental work <i>Jewish Medical Ethics</i> and culminating in Avraham Steinberg&#8217;s <i>Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics</i>. Scholars and Rabbis have over the last fifty years developed a particular Jewish bioethics and given an authentic Jewish response to such questions as end of life care, artificial reproduction and abortion. Notwithstanding these achievements I think there are five fundamental areas that future Jewish bioethicists have to pay particular attention to.</p>
<ol>
<li>An authentic Jewish ethical response is heavily dependent on Talmudic sources and precedent. However many modern ethical questions simply have no precedent in the Jewish sources as Louis Newman has pointed out in his landmark article <i>On Woodchoppers and Respirators</i> <i>The Problem of Interpretation in Contemporary Jewish Ethics</i>. (1) For example, how does develop a Jewish approach to such questions as cloning and the development of human-animal chimeras (not to mention the rapidly growing fields of public health ethics and bio-environmental ethics) where there is a paucity or absence of halakhic material. Jewish ethicists in the past have relied on aggadda and Jewish theology to help answer these questions but this also raises the methodological question of how to use these sources to develop normative law. (2)</li>
<li>Another question related to Jewish medical ethics is what is the relevance of the field to general medical ethics? In other words why should a non-Jew care about what the Jewish tradition says about a particular area? Daniel Callahan has argued that for the benefit of an extensive exposure &#8220;to the accumulated wisdom and knowledge that are the fruit of long established religious traditions. I do not have to be Jewish to find it profitable and illuminating to see how the great rabbinical teachers have tried to understand moral problems over the centuries.&#8221;(3) From a different perspective David Novak has long claimed that halakha and particularly the seven universal commandments, from which most of JME is derived, are rooted in natural law and therefore have universal applicability. (4)</li>
<li>In modern secular medical ethics there is a consensus that the ultimate decision maker should be the patient or their surrogate. Autonomy is one of the four basic principles of modern bioethics (and some say the ultimate principle) and the Charter on Medical Professionalism, which states as one of its cardinal principles “Physicians must be honest with their patients and empower them to make informed decisions about their treatment.” (5) Traditionally, from a Jewish perspective the Rabbi has been the ultimate authority and the question arises in the modern healthcare environment if that is still a tenable position. Rabbi Emmanuel Rackman has even gone as far as to suggest in relation to triage that &#8220;&#8221;when one must choose between two persons, who will live and who will die, the decision must be that of the person who will act upon it and not that of the state or any of its duly authorized agents. ….the rich legal literature of Judaism provides him with no imperatives. No court will authorize his action in advance and no functionary of the state will or should be his surrogate to decide for him. The only sanction he may suffer will come from his conscience and public opinion. His problem is exclusively ethical and not legal in character…. It seems to me that human beings who are confronted with the problem of making a choice must evaluate all the circumstances and make their own decision&#8221;.(6)</li>
<li>The question also arises of whether there can even be a Jewish bioethics due to the lack of consensus even among ultra-orthodox authorities not to mention inter-denominational differences of opinions. For example Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, two of the greatest poskim of the twentieth century, have widely divergent opinions on such fundamental questions such as abortion and end of life care. An esteemed halakhic authority can come to the same conclusion as the Catholic Church regarding abortion and an equally distinguished authority can rule that even late term abortion is permitted in certain instances. If this is indeed the case then what is the meaning and significance of a Jewish bioethic?</li>
<li>JME has traditionally been focused on the relatively straightforward clinical questions such as how aggressively to treat a patient at the end of life or in which cases an abortion is permitted. However, there should be much more to a Jewish approach to these questions reflecting the traditional concern with character development and supererogatory behavior. For example, beyond the question of whether an elderly demented patient should be fed which relates to the question of quality of life versus sanctity of life, the commandment to respect your parents and the obligation to feed them should enter into the discourse. (7) The requirements of Bikur Cholim and confession before death and how they are done appropriately should be a factor in the Jewish  discussion of the doctor-patient relationship and professionalism. (8,9) However this perspective has been missing in may modern presentations of JME which tend to focus more on the dry legal issues and less on how these dilemmas relate to the development of an altruistic and empathic personality. These latter concerns have been a staple of those concerned with virtue ethics and should also play a role in JME.</li>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Remember the culture wars in Modern Orthodox Judaism between 1995-2002? The age of Edah, the founding of YCT, the promulgating of the doctrine of mesorah, ban of WPG and furthering women’s role in the synagogue, the decline of the Orthodox Caucus and RCA Roundtable, and the tehillim rallies against the new President. Did anyone record the events week by week? Did anyone produce a book by 2003 delineating the struggle within Orthodoxy?</p>
<p>I recently discovered that the similar struggles within Southern Baptists were immediately documented by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uneasy-Babylon-Southern-Convservative-American/dp/0817350810">Barry Hankins in his well received book <em>Uneasy in Babylon</em> in 2003.</a> The book had several good <a href="http://jsr.fsu.edu/2002/Reviews/watson.htm">reviews here</a> <a href="http://www.christreformedbaptist.org/uploads/1/0/6/4/10645670/book_review._uneasy_in_babylon.pdf">and here.</a> His book explains to the moderates that the new conservative forces were not a throwback to some Fundamentalism, and he explains to the conservatives that the moderates were not liberals rather they expected a broad accepting Church.  He explains the differences in various liberal and conservative positions seeking  to inform his readers that they are not all the same. Most importantly, he shows how a leadership role for women was the wedge issue that divided the groups. Let me know if any of this sound familiar in Modern Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The books starts with the once upon a time story that In 1967 southern Baptists were at ease in their enclave as Southern, Christian, Baptist- subculture “it was the catholic church of the south. ” However, by the end of the twentieth century it was no longer homogeneous (1) During this era there was a grand compromise of placing in control neither right or left. No one was seen as excluded, and their were various emphasis by congregations on mission to others, truth, service, and personal conversion (6)</p>
<p>In 1979, there were conservative appointments that were portrayed by moderates as a start of a takeover- originally seen as mild violation of grand compromise. (7) In the 1980’s conventions and meetings grew n size as each side began to recruit organize and mobilize. Liberals were seen as not believers and conservatives seen as power hungry.  Both sides focus on worst case scenario of the other’s position. (12) Hankins to avoid the conflict avoids using the words fundamentalist or liberals but conservatives and  moderates.</p>
<p>Many tried to tarnish the conservatives as Fundamentalists,  but Baptists were not fundamentalists in 1930’s. They have a denominational independence, they use different terms, are active missions,  (Compare Modern Orthodox vs Ultra-Orthodox split). Conservatives start in the 1980’s with rhetoric that they are the only true church (15) Prior to the 1980’s, Baptists have a negative view of evangelicals as narrow, card-carrying, and anti-denominational. Evangelicals are Yankees, Lutherans, or those preoccupied with Orthodoxy.   (16-17) Yet, by the end of the 1980’s there was a growing sense that they are becoming evangelical, reading Schaffer, and Christianity Today. (21)</p>
<p>Hankins has an interesting point on the difference between those groups like SBC  or RCA/ YU orthodoxy that is full service, in contrast northern Evangelicals and Artscroll/Community Kollel  are interdenominational in their publishing, in outreach work,  in colleges (and yeshivot),  and in periodicals.</p>
<p>The real story starts in 1996 when Albert Mohler takes over the seminary in Louisville Kentucky and turned it sharply right, accomplishing in three years a decade worth of turns. A turn to the right with a speed and velocity that overtook most students and faculty (28, 81) (Was it like this in Judaism?)In 1996, Mohler made women’s issues as the sole litmus test of hiring and firing, it left only a hardline group. Can a women be a preacher? He asked all incoming faculty and he made those faculty sympathetic to women clergy uncomfortable enough to leave. All speakers, authors, and affiliate personal could not affirm women clergy.</p>
<p>Hankins points out, and I have been saying it for years, that you can be hardline without being sectarian or fundamentalist. (or Haredi)  (85) Moderates could get phd but not speak in the university, now one should not read wrong authors in class, guest speakers now needed an ok. (28)</p>
<p>At the start of 1996, moderates called conservatives who didn’t accept critical theories morons. (33)The moderates had a false sense of academic elitism.  They saw themselves as conduits of college and graduate school study but Hankins points out that their sense of themselves was inflated and ideologically driven (Think of the Torah uMadda advocates).In reality these  moderates or liberals faculty were rather conservative by ivy league standards . (97, 104) Moderates say the right as combative in an un-Christian way against liberals, women’s roles, gays, and democrats  (98) This process removed the diversity of evangelicals (104)</p>
<p>The conservatives also started to portray America as a Christian country and to see state, university and media as against religion.  (119-120)</p>
<p>The seminary did not turn for inspiration to the new generation of believing philosophers such as Alvin Plantinga, Keith Yandell,  nor did they turn to Evangelical defenses and rebuttals of historical study.</p>
<p>Albert Mohler embraces post-modernism to argue that (1) truth is not universal or objective but socially constructed, hence one only knows it through the Church (  AB- compare halakhic man’s Kantian constructivism to only knowing the text though mesorah of authorized Rabbis.) (2) There is no metanarrative that all are bound to, so one should accept the  Christian narrative. (3) The text has lost its meaning in Western culture so we can affirm the inerrant Bible without worrying about historical research.(47-48)</p>
<p>The book concludes that no Baptist congregation was ever punished for its stance on women’s leadership or participation, the only ones that were punished were those allowing same sex marriage (226).</p>
<p>After remaking the seminary, between 2003 -2010 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mohler">-Albert Mohler turned outward</a> and became an outspoken leader in American Evangelical religion whose positions are to the right of his colleges, but this does make him a return to Fundamentalism or superstition.</p>
<p>So where was this like Modern Orthodoxy circa 1996-2002? After?</p>
<p>(Let me know typos in comments and I will correct them.)</p>

				<h3>Unearthed: the authentic sound of Sigmund Freud</h3>

<p><em>Psychology</em> magazine has retrieved the only known recording of Sigmund Freud, a statement in English taken by a BBC crew in December 1938 and deposited at the Library of Congress. This you must hear:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='480' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5jJ6Lhk1pNg?version=3&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
<p>Transcript: <em>I started my professional activity as a neurologist trying to bring relief to my neurotic patients. Under the influence of an older friend and by my own efforts, I discovered some important new facts about the unconscious in psychic life, the role of instinctual urges, and so on. Out of these findings grew a new science, psychoanalysis, a part of psychology, and a new method of treatment of the neuroses. I had to pay heavily for this bit of good luck. People did not believe in my facts and thought my theories unsavory. Resistance was strong and unrelenting. In the end I succeeded in acquiring pupils and building up an International Psychoanalytic Association. But the struggle is not yet over.  –Sigmund Freud.</em></p>
<p>And  for comparison Rav Soloveitchik</p>

				<p>This piece from ten years ago by Rabbi Prof. Marc Shapiro, which was written for <a href="http://www.kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=4915&amp;highlight=rashba">the Rabbi Abadie website,</a> was circulating on my Facebook page this morning. I never saw it before, enjoyed it, and thought others would find it interesting. I asked Marc if I could post it: He said sure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=4915&amp;highlight=rashba">Q &amp; A Board &#8211; View Post</a><br />
 Author: 	Marc<br />
E-mail: 	not available<br />
Date: 	11/11/2003 8:02:00 AM<br />
Subject: 	Clarification</p>
<p>Message: 	I have noticed that many people don&#8217;t understand the basic shitah of this website. With your permission, let me clarify something.<br />
Rav Henkin, who together with R. Moshe Feinstein was the leading halakhic authority in the U.S. in the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s, is quoted as saying that the entire basis for the existence of the kashrut organizations is the view of the rashba. What did he mean by this?<br />
   There is a machloket rishonim and the rashba holds that if a non-Jew, in the normal process of making a food product, adds some non-kosher element, even a very small percentage, then it is not batel. Bittul only works when it falls in by accident. This view is known by those who study Yoreh Deah since it is quoted in the Beit Yosef.<br />
   If you look at any of the standard Yoreh Deah books you will find, however, that the halakhah is not in accordance with this rashba. Rather, any time the goy puts a small amount of treif into the food it is batel, even if it is intentional on his part. There is a famous Noda Biyehudah that discusses this at length. See Mahadura Tinyana, Yoreh Deah no. 56 where he permits a drink that was produced using treif meat in the production but the amount of meat was very small and could not be tasted. He states that it is permissible. There is a Rama who has a teshuvah and states similarly. (I am sure if you describe the Noda Biyehudah&#8217;s case to people, even learned ones, and say that there is a contemporary rabbi who permits this, they will mockingly refer to him as a Conservative or Reform rabbi since in their mind no &#8220;real&#8221; rabbi who knows halakhah could ever permit something that has non-kosher meat in it!)</p>
<p>   So now we can understand R. Henkin&#8217;s comment. If you go to the kashrut organizations&#8217; websites and speak to them they will tell you that you need the hashgachah because sometimes the runs are not properly cleaned between kosher and non-kosher or milk and meat and some slight amounts of the objectionable ingredient might remain (yet here even rashba will agree that it&#8217;s not a problem!), or they tell you about release agents or that small amounts of ingredients are not listed on the label, etc. etc. The rashba indeed holds that these last cases are problematic, but the halakhah is not in accordance with the rashba. The hashgachot have raised the bar and are now operating at a chumra level here as well as in other areas. But the average person has no idea about any of this and has never even heard about the concept of bittul. Even if you explain the concept of bittul to him, his response will be: &#8220;OK maybe this is the strict halakhah, but I&#8217;m not starving so why should I eat something that we had to rely on bittul for. A person who cares about kashrut won&#8217;t eat something that has even the smallest amount of treif.&#8221; Since people haven&#8217;t been educated about the halakhot, they assume that bittul is a kula to be used in emergency situations, and it is not their fault that they believe this, since this is the view that the kashrut organization hold and publicize.<br />
    There is a good article waiting to be written about how in the last thirty years we went from halakhah to chumra when it comes to food issues.</p>

				<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">At another session at the Yarnton Manor Conference on Modern Orthodoxy the topic was the sociology of the Orthodox community. The speakers were Daniel Sperber: “Tradition, Continuity and Innovation: Opposing Halakhic Concerns” Sarah Benor, &#8220;Frum Unity, Frum Diversity: The Orthodox Continuum in Popular Culture.&#8221;Samuel Heilman, &#8220;Old and New Orthodoxies”and Chaim I Waxman – Respondent. The presentation by Sarah Benor was novel and engaging. For those who just missed her at Limmud-NY, then catch her talk at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/hillel/events/viewevent.xml?id=691">Princeton University this Wednesday.</a> (This blog has a sizable Princeton readership who should attend.)</span></p>
<p><a href="http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/benor.shtml"> Sarah Bunin Benor is an Associate Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College</a> – Jewish Institute of Religion (Los Angeles campus) and Adjunct Associate Professor in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. She received her Ph.D. from Stanford University in Linguistics in 2004. She teaches about the social science of American Jews, as well as about language and culture. In addition to the book&nbsp;<a href="http://becomingfrum.weebly.com/">Becoming Frum</a>, she has published many academic papers and given lectures around the country about Jewish languages, linguistics, Yiddish, and American Jews. Dr. Benor edits the Journal of Jewish Languages and the Jewish Language Research Website, both of which she founded.</p>
<p>She is almost single-handedly (re)creating a field of Jewish Linguistics.</p>
<p>She has a website of Jewish-English keeping track of Yinglish, Hebrish, and other distinctive ways Jews speak English.</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.jewish-languages.org/jewish-english-lexicon/welcome">goals of the Jewish English Lexicon (JEL) </a>are to collect data on the English of Jews in America and elsewhere and to make it available to the general public. JEL is a collaborative database of distinctive words that are used in the speech or writing of English-speaking Jews. Think of it as the Wikipedia or Urban Dictionary of Jewish language.</p></blockquote>
<p>She wrote a seminal paper on the language of American Jews as a Jewish language and concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, American Jews do speak a Jewish language comparable to Judeo-Persian, JudeoArabic, Judeo-Greek, and many other Diaspora languages.<br />
When we analyze the distinctive repertoire available to American Jews, we ﬁnd that it does have most of the components common among other Jewish languages. It has a non-Jewish coterritorial base language (English), a Hebrew/Aramaic component, inﬂuences from a previous Jewish language (Yiddish), displaced dialectalism, other distinctive features not linked to previous languages, avoidance of non-Jewish religious features, and a recognition that Jews use distinctive language.</p>
<p>In addition to these similarities, we also ﬁnd important differences. Jewish American English is written in the same alphabet as general American English (albeit with occasional remnants of Hebrew orthography), rendering it more accessible to non-Jews than any language written in the Jewish alphabet.<br />
American Jews are generally able to speak an English indistinguishable from that of nonJews—even to pass as non-Jews, if they so choose—leaving American Jews much less vulnerable to linguistic ridicule than some Jews of the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prof Benor’s recent book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Frum-Newcomers-Language-Orthodox/dp/081355389X/ref=la_B00A27A588_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361243524&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Becoming Frum: How Newcomers Learn the Language and Culture of Orthodox Judaism</strong></a> (Go read it!)</p>
<p>The <a href="becomingfrum.weebly.com/index.html">book has a website</a>&nbsp;and here are&nbsp;some&nbsp;excerpts:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the few times I heard Milldale Orthodox Jews listening to non-Orthodox music was in the Kramers’ van on the way to New York for a wed­ding. The Kramer parents both became BTs in their twenties, and their teenage children have grown up as FFBs. For part of the trip, they listened to an Orthodox band. When the tape ended, they turned on the radio, which was set to a classic rock station. When “American Pie” started, the children got excited. They sang along for the chorus and some of the verses. But just as the singer was about to say, “The three men I admire most, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost,” the mother turned the volume all the way down. One of the sons asked why, and she answered, “It’s words you don’t want stuck in your head.” The older daughter said, “Probably something about Yoshke” (the Yid­dish diminutive form of Jesus and the name I generally heard applied to him in Orthodox communities). After “American Pie” was over, the mother put in another Orthodox tape, which happened to start with “Ani ma’amin,” a Hebrew song stating a “full belief” that the Moshiach (Messiah) will come. I couldn’t help but smile about the ironic contrast.” (p. 74)<br />
“For many BTs, feeling or being called inauthentic does not stop them from participating in Orthodox practices. When Mark was a Peripheral BT, he told me that he felt he was not acting like himself when he used chanting intonation or wore a black hat. But he sometimes adopted these behaviors anyway, because, he said, “it’s fun.” So when he was planning his wedding, he told friends and family that it would be “black hat optional, and I’m opting in.” Although put­ting on this “costume” did not seem authentic to him, it was an enjoyable way of connecting with the community. As Ira, an advisor at a BT yeshiva, says, “To a large part, everyone’s putting on a costume in [a BT] yeshiva.” This self-consciousness tends to be only temporary; BTs who continue to participate in a cultural practice eventually feel it is an authentic part of who they have become.” (p. 178)</p></blockquote>
<p>She has a fascinating article on the <a href="http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=13602">language of non-Orthodox Jewish elites, </a>the super-Jews, showing their language as distinct from ordinary Jews.</p>
<blockquote><p>I argue that the major factor in the distinctive linguistic profile of non-Orthodox Jewish elites is their interaction with others like them. Anyone who attends synagogue more than monthly, has spent significant time in Israel, and/or reports that most of their close friends are engaged in Jewish life (the three criteria we used to define super Jews) likely has regular conversations with others like them. In addition, almost half of young super Jews in the sample refrain from handling money on Shabbat, which suggests that they may also host and/or attend Shabbat meals regularly. We know from studies around the world that people who talk to each other on a regular basis often converge linguistically&#8230;Participating in Jewish religious and communal life offers Jews ample opportunity to converse with others like them and to learn and spread Hebrew and Yiddish words. <a href="http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=13602">Read the rest here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>And she has an article on how the language of Reform sisterhoods changed . <a href="http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/benor/Reform%20sisterhood%20volume%20Benor%2012-12.pdf">“From Sabbath to Shabbat: Changing Language of Reform Sisterhood Leaders, 1913-2012.”</a> In Women of Reform Judaism / National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods Centenary Volume</p>
<p>1) <strong>What was it like for you as a non-Orthodox Jew doing research in an&nbsp;</strong><strong>Orthodox community? Is there anything you want to convey to the&nbsp;</strong><strong>Orthodox community?</strong></p>
<p>It was a great experience. I am a religiously engaged non-Orthodox<br />
Jew, and I came to my research with a good deal of knowledge about<br />
halacha, tefillah, brachot, and chagim. I also came in with<br />
proficiency in Hebrew and Yiddish. In that sense, I had an easier time<br />
making sense of Orthodox culture and fitting in than some new BTs and<br />
gerim (converts) who come from secular or non-Jewish backgrounds. On the other&nbsp;hand, my experiences also mirrored those of a new BT in many ways, as<br />
we both encountered new traditions, Ashkenazi pronunciations,<br />
different gender distinctions, and a community that’s much more tight<br />
knit than our own. One major difference between my experiences and<br />
those of BTs: I knew that my participation in Orthodoxy was just<br />
temporary, and they expect that theirs will be long-term. Some of the<br />
people I met during my research expected that I would become frum<br />
myself, and a few were disappointed that I didn’t. I hope that<br />
Orthodox Jews will read my book, even though it’s written by a<br />
non-Orthodox Jew. I hope they’ll see in my writing my deep respect for<br />
Orthodox communities and culture. And I hope they’ll invite me to give<br />
talks at their shuls and kiruv centers.</p>
<p>2) <strong>What is your method of sociolinguistics? And how does it produce&nbsp;</strong><strong>different results than other sociological methods?</strong></p>
<p>My main method is ethnography: hanging out with people, visiting their<br />
homes, attending their lifecycle events, going to shul and school with<br />
them, and going out to restaurants with them. I observe their<br />
interactions, I talk to them informally, and I also do formal<br />
interviews. Throughout this process, I write detailed notes about what<br />
I observed and heard, and I analyze those notes regularly, leading to<br />
more questions I can ask and hypotheses I can test. This is a classic<br />
anthropological technique, and it’s increasingly used in sociology<br />
too. In addition, I also listened carefully to their language and<br />
analyzed their use of words from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Yiddish, their<br />
grammatical influences from Yiddish, and other distinctive features<br />
(like /t/ release). I also did a sociolinguistic experiment called a<br />
matched guise test, in which I recorded an individual saying a<br />
sentence in two slightly different ways (like “Do you know where he<br />
was going?” and “Do you know where he was goingk” or “rosh chodesh”<br />
and “rosh choydesh”), mixed up a bunch of speech excerpts, and played<br />
them back for community members. I then asked them whether they<br />
thought the speaker was Orthodox and FFB (frum from birth), and their responses told me&nbsp;a lot about the linguistic feature in question.</p>
<p>3) <strong>How does your data show Modern Orthodoxy as separate from the rest of Orthodoxy?</strong></p>
<p>In my study of responses on Frumster.com, I found that users who<br />
self-select the category Modern Orthodox Liberal differed<br />
significantly from those who selected other categories (Modern<br />
Orthodox Machmir, Yeshivish Modern, and Yeshivish Black Hat) in a<br />
number of indicators, including head covering (kippah/hat type for<br />
men, plans to cover hair for women), tzitzit, and skirts vs. pants. I<br />
found a continuum in all four categories for several of the<br />
indicators, but for some, Modern Orthodox Liberal was distinct from<br />
the other three.</p>
<p>4) <strong>How do certain ways of pronouncing letters like stronger Ts show&nbsp;</strong><strong>rabbinic authority?</strong></p>
<p>Americans have a few ways of pronouncing a /t/ at the end of a word,<br />
including with or without a release of air.&nbsp;The released /t/ is common&nbsp;among people presenting themselves with an air of authority. This is&nbsp;not just an Orthodox thing- it can be heard in diverse communities. I&nbsp;found that in Orthodox communities /t/ release is more common among&nbsp;men than women and that people tend to release their /t/s more when&nbsp;they are in a position of authority (or when they want to indicate a&nbsp;stance of adamance). It’s not just a rabbinic linguistic feature, but&nbsp;certainly many rabbis release their /t/s frequently, because they&nbsp;often seek to speak with authority. &nbsp;( AB-&nbsp;to&nbsp;articulate -a&nbsp;speech&nbsp;sound,&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;as&nbsp;to&nbsp;produce&nbsp;an&nbsp;audible&nbsp;puff&nbsp;of&nbsp;breath,&nbsp;as with&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;total,&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;second&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;being &nbsp;usually unaspirated.)</p>
<p>5) <strong>What do you make of the Orthodox rejection of liberal Jews from their&nbsp;</strong><strong>purview? What do your HUC students not grasp about Orthodoxy or where&nbsp;</strong><strong>are they most resistant (other than egalitarianistm)?</strong></p>
<p>This is, in my opinion, one of the most pressing issues facing<br />
American Jewry today: the fact that many Orthodox and non-Orthodox<br />
Jews have disdain for each other. I think the problem stems mostly<br />
from lack of knowledge and contact. In my fieldwork I heard some<br />
Orthodox Jews (especially but not only ba’alei teshuva) making<br />
critical comments about Reform and Conservative Jews and their<br />
institutions. And in my everyday life in the non-Orthodox world (in<br />
Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative, and post-denominational<br />
egalitarian circles), I sometimes hear critical comments about<br />
Orthodox Jews and their institutions. I also hear people on both sides<br />
of this divide talking about “Jewish diversity and unity” and “klal yisrael” while<br />
(sometimes inadvertently) excluding those on the other side. Most<br />
people who make critical comments do not understand how diverse and<br />
dynamic the other group is.&nbsp;Orthodox Jews tend not to know that some Conservative Jews observe Shabbat strictly and that some Reform services are now mostly in Hebrew. And non-Orthodox Jews tend not to&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">know that some Modern Orthodox shuls have women’s tefillah groups and&nbsp;</span>that many Haredim have professional degrees. People in both groups&nbsp;assume that those in the other group have no interest in them. I hope&nbsp;this book serves as a small step in addressing this issue:&nbsp;non-Orthodox readers will learn about a Black Hat community and about&nbsp;diversity in the Orthodox world, and Orthodox readers will understand&nbsp;that a non-Orthodox researcher can represent frum Jews and frum&nbsp;culture in a positive and respectful way.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Any thoughts on how Orthodox Academics shift their way of speaking in&nbsp;</strong><strong>presentation, discussion, and dinner? Can you give examples?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>At the conference on Orthodoxy, most of the&nbsp;participants were Orthodox. One of my favorite parts of the conference&nbsp;was the question and answer session after one particular talk. This one<em>&nbsp;</em>speaker gave his presentation in a very academic way, talking about&nbsp;the Pentateuch and referring to biblical concepts with their English&nbsp;names. As soon as he began his answer to the first question, he&nbsp;switched to a more Yeshivish style, using Hebrew names for biblicalconcepts and using other distinctive Orthodox features, like the Israeli&nbsp;hesitation click. His New York accent even became stronger. During the&nbsp;rest of the conference, including coffee breaks, meals, and other&nbsp;academic sessions, he (along with most of the other attendees)&nbsp;used varying degrees of Orthodox features in his&nbsp;English, but he never shifted back to pure Academese. This kind of&nbsp;style shifting is common and useful. We wouldn’t expect a frum scholar&nbsp;to use Yeshivish at AAR, and we wouldn’t expect him to use Academese&nbsp;at his rov’s mussar shmues.</p>

<p>It depends on the individual. Some BTs (acronym for ba’alei teshuva),<br />
especially those who have been frum for many years, are<br />
indistinguishable from FFBs. Those individuals sometimes intentionally<br />
pass as FFB and don’t correct people who assume they are FFB. But many<br />
do not feel comfortable with this situation, and they avoid it by<br />
referring to their non-Orthodox past or to their process of teshuva.<br />
However, most new BTs are not able to pass as FFB. Some indicate their<br />
BT status by trying too hard to fit in – maybe their skirt is longer<br />
than it needs to be, they display their tzitzis too conspicuously, or<br />
they say “baruch Hashem” and “mamish” too much. Others indicate their<br />
BT status through unique combinations, like geflite fish made with<br />
with Indian spices, a black hat worn with trendy sunglasses, or Hebrew<br />
and Yiddish words combined with American slang (like “mamish keepin’<br />
it real”). This distinctiveness is sometimes intentional and sometimes<br />
not. As I write in chapter 1: “Even when BTs attempt to pass as FFB,<br />
their in-between status may become apparent to those in the know,<br />
based on the tilt of a hat, the slit of a skirt, or the shape of a<br />
vowel.”</p>
