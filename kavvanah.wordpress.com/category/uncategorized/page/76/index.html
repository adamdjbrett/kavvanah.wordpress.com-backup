				<p>Interview With Riccardo Di Segni<br />
By Giancarlo Giojelli</p>
<p>(For background on Rabbi di Segni and his positions, <a href="../../../../2010/01/17/chief-rabbi-desegni-on-the-jewish-catholic-encounter/index.html">see this prior post- be sure to scroll down in the prior post.</a>)</p>
<p>ROME, JAN. 18, 2011 The 22nd annual Jewish-Christian dialogue day was held in Italy on Monday. The religious leaders continued with a program that began in 2005 to focus on the Ten Commandments.<br />
The annual Jan. 17 event began in 1990 sponsored by the Italian bishops&#8217; conference and Jewish leaders.<br />
This year, the discussion turned to the Commandment: Honor your father and your mother. </p>
<p>For the occasion, ZENIT is publishing an Italian Radio and Television (RAI) interview with the chief rabbi of Rome, Riccardo Di Segni.</p>
<p>Q: Then, what does it mean to be brothers? Do Christians and Jews have a common Father and Mother?</p>
<p>Di Segni: The whole of humanity has a father and a mother in common if there is meaning in the story of the Bible that the whole of humanity derives from Adam and then from Noah, all of us must acknowledge we have a common predecessor so no one can say &#8212; our texts say this &#8212; he is superior to another, because we have a common origin. In this sense, the whole of humanity is brotherhood. Then there are three human groups linked more closely and undoubtedly the link that exists between Jews and Christians is a link of particular closeness, which can be represented under the image of brotherhood, with all the ups and downs that can exist in brotherhood.</p>
<p>Q: The word dialogue can have a strong or weak meaning. There can be, let us say, a diplomatic dialogue, which does not affect life, and a dialogue that involves and changes the person. The relationship between man and God in the Bible is often a dramatic dialogue. Hence, what is the dialogue between Christians and Jews?</p>
<p>Di Segni: I would say that it is a necessity that we cannot avoid, even if, as experience shows, it is a difficult experience because it must overcome a whole series of obstacles placed by history, by theology and by everyday life. The fact that it is difficult, however, must not exempt one from addressing it, having also a minimum of hope and a minimum of serenity that something good will come out of it.</p>
<p>Q: You lived John Paul II&#8217;s visits to the synagogue and last year you received Benedict XVI. What do you make of those meetings?</p>
<p>Di Segni: They were different visits. Different because of the time and the personality. The first was an epochal event, which marked a turn in history, symbolically. The second was an event of confirmation of a line. It is in these events &#8230; but the last was not an event in which everything went peacefully, there was a whole backdrop of controversies and I insisted much that in any case it take place because I believe that what it leaves is the sensation that beyond that which divides there are common elements and common obligations, above all the common obligation to walk together, which we cannot shun. Arriving at the synagogue, Benedict XVI paused before the stone that remembers the deported Roman Jews.</p>
<p>Q: How do Italians who are in contact with other cultures, who live in other parts of the world, live the relationship between the great monotheistic religions?</p>
<p>Di Segni: To go around the world is a great lesson to understand the differences. Today, Italy is free from provincialism, the human landscape we see walking through the streets of any Italian city is very changed from what it was 20 years ago. It is essential to know the differences to understand that humanity does not stop with someone who has a face like mine but that we must understand, above all, that there are these differences, and then learn to live together.</p>
<p>Q: Is diversity a danger or a richness?</p>
<p>Di Segni: Difference must be a richness.</p>
<p>Q: The prophet Zechariah and also Isaiah, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, speaks of a day in which Jews and Gentiles will eat together on the feast of Sukkot, which recalls the pilgrimage in the desert. Is this common table only a utopia or a prophecy that in some way already operates in the present?</p>
<p>Di Segni: Judaism lives from utopia and hence the fact that it is a utopia does not mean that it won&#8217;t take place but that instead it must take place and in our prayers we confirm the concept that nothing that has been said by the mouth of the prophets has failed and therefore sooner or later it must be fulfilled. In some way some little thing is happening but it is still a long way away.</p>
<p>Q: The desert is still long?</p>
<p>Di Segni: Yes. However, the situation of the desert could be an ideal situation.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The Romantic approach to Hasidism takes metaphysical statements projected onto nature and turns then into aesthetic statements about nature itself. For example, seeing God in all things which is about a mental state of devotion is understood by Romantic readers as meaning that Hasidim appreciated nature. Jay Michaelson has a long analytic article showing that this is not so; Hasidic panentheism does not lead to any appreciation of the natural order. Unfortunately, this was the analytic reading of texts that <a href="../../../../2009/09/30/a-post-secular-jewish-dharma-bum/index.html">was sorely lacking in his last book.</a> After this article, I am left with the question:Will Jay relinquish Hasidism since it is not world embracing or will he develop a  new Jewish metaphysics? </p>
<p>Hasidism and “Nature”: Negation and Affirmation By Jay Michaelson</p>
<p>As regards the natural world, Hasidic texts offer a range of theological and practical options, from the nature mysticism of Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav to panentheistic theologies which depict God as immanent in (and yet concealed by) the natural world.<br />
Would the early Hasidic masters be environmentalists? To ask such a question is, of course, anachronistic, yet to pose this anachronistic question is a useful entry point for exploring more general Hasidic attitudes towards the status not only of the “natural” world as we conceive it today, but the created cosmos as such.<br />
I want to suggest here that we can discern four distinct models of the relationships to what in contemporary parlance – though not to the Hasidim – is known as “nature,” </p>
<p><strong>The Shoemaker: Non-specific immanentism as a form of world-negation</strong></p>
<p>R. Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye quotes a story of the Baal Shem Tov that depicts the mystical hero Enoch as being a shoemaker who “united the Holy one, blessed be He and his Shechinah, by each and every [act of] sewing.” Regardless of the “deed” in question, uniting deed and thought effects a supernal union.</p>
<p>Initially, this view seems to be highly world-affirming, and highly radical. It makes every act important, as in the Hasidic story of the hasid who went to the Maggid of Mezrich not to learn some esoteric aspect of Kabbalah or learned insight into the Torah, but to see “how he tied his shoes.” This story has been used by Buber and others to suggest that the Hasidim were not interested in supernal realms and abstract mysteries but in the existential realms of the day-to-and here-and-now.</p>
<p>And yet, at the same time, the “shoemaker view” includes too much to be of use for environmentalism per se. Shoes or shoelaces are no more and no less useful than forests and rivers; this form of panentheism collapses into an apathy regarding what we today would call the “natural world” as against anything else. Moreover, Hasidic sources are ambivalent as to what, exactly, is meant by the yichudim in the Enoch story. Surely it is not a mindfulness-like attention to the texture of the shoes and the stitches. More likely it is utilizing the material object as a means to attain some spiritual insight or experience. Enoch is holding the shoes, but he is thinking of supernal spheres.<br />
But if any action can be done with devotion, then what matters is that devotion, not the context of the action. Phenomenal features of the natural world, be they forests or parking lots, are unimportant, because all are equally valid gateways to God.</p>
<p><strong>The Tanya: Nondual acosmism as an intermediate, but unsatisfying, position</strong></p>
<p>One of the most pregnant equations in Hasidic quasi-environmental thought is R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi’s quotation of the Zohar that Elohim is numerically equivalent to Hateva. Yet R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi’s Tanya presents an ontological worldview which essentially holds that everything we think of as yesh (something) is actually ayin (nothing) and that which is ayin is really the only true existent. </p>
<p>However, the Tanya is not purely acosmic, in the sense that it does not deny the reality of the world but envisions yesh as the “body” and ayin as the “soul.” The dichotomies of this aspect of the Tanya may be presented as:<br />
tzimtzum / or (uncontracted light)<br />
gevurah / hesed<br />
elohim / YHVH<br />
hateva/immanent / transcendent<br />
olam/maalim (covering) / ne’elam (that which is covered)<br />
what seems to be yesh / what seems to be ayin<br />
actually ayin / actually Yesh</p>
<p>What is critical to understand is that everything on the left covers what is on the right, but also in some way reveals it. First, there can be no existence without tzimtzum, according to the Tanya, so the left column is not merely the “bad stuff” from which the gnostic wants to get away – the left column is an integral, and real, element of the dialectic of existence. Second, and relatedly, the left column is not “unreal,” although I there is considerable unclarity on this point that leaves room for the possibility that R. Schneur Zalman believes the world is a “dream,” like his Vedantin counterparts. I think we can say, though, that although the tzimtzum is only a condition of the Ultimate, and not the Ultimate itself, it is still a real condition. The world is in a state of tzimtzum<br />
Elohim is a mask, not just a veil, and masks reveal, even as they conceal.</p>
<p><strong>The Beautiful Woman: Specific contemplation as a form of world-affirmation</strong></p>
<p>R. Jacob Joseph of Polonnoye tells a story of a humble man who meditates with great emotional longing on the image of a beautiful woman. Though his motives at first are purely carnal, he eventually separates himself from the corporeal aspects of this longing and unites with God. This story has its echo in the Maggid of Mezrich’s advice on dealing with distracting thoughts: rather than banish them from the mind, the Maggid advises taking the thought to its “root” – a beautiful woman, for example, is the aspect of tiferet. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think it is fair to say that the “beautiful woman” view does value the aesthetic qualities of the object of contemplation. Unlike the shoemaker, the hasid in the beautiful woman case is in some ways interested in the actual “structure” of the woman, at least insofar as it leads him to meditate on more sublime matters. This is hardly environmentalism, but it could be a start.</p>
<p><strong>The Song of the Grass: Simple Devotionalism as Ecological Foundation?</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, then, we turn to R. Nachman of Bratzlav. So far, we have seen three distinct Hasidic approaches to the “natural world”: first, that any form can be used for contemplation, a car as well as a cheetah; second, that while the contours of ‘nature’ reveal as well as conceal, they are not those of ‘nature’ in our contemporary sense; and third, that beautiful forms may be better than non-beautiful ones for proper intellection.</p>
<p>R. Nachman has a few isolated, but by now famous in Neo-Hasidic circles, passages in which he rhapsodizes about the beauty of the natural world and the efficacy of using natural settings for meditation: blades of grass sing a song to God, meditation should be done in fields to partake in their beauty, et cetera. (See e.g. Sichot HaRan #98, #144, #227) </p>
<p>If the goal of the shoemaker story was to show that a complete heart, lev shalem, is what is needed to attain the ultimate goal, let us remember that for R. Nachman, ein lev shalem k’lev shavur, there is no pure/complete heart like a broken heart. And for the heart to break, there must be action. There must be an actual giving of money, an actual trip to the rebbe, and above all, an actual cry. This means that the contours of the material world matter essentially for the spiritual world. That a field brings more joy than a basement is relevant, because the emotional journey of the mystic is relevant.</p>
<p>Without the challenges of the outside world, this psychomachia could not take place. There must be something to push against, a challenge to fight against, or else there can be no challenge, and thus no religious value. For R. Nachman, unlike the shoemaker, there must be real difficulties in the actual making of the actual shoes. Correspondingly, R. Nachman will be more willing to use “natural” objects to attain joyfulness.. If it is a shoe, it is a shoe. If it is a beautiful field, it is a beautiful field.</p>
<p>R. Nachman is precisely the Hasidic master who had the least to do with nondualism, panentheism, and immanentism – all of which are popular with neo-Hasidim. Precisely the Hasidic outlier who didn’t see “God in all things” turns out to generate the best religio-mystical foundation for an affirmation of the natural world.</p>
<p>But what today’s popularizers miss is that “seeing God everywhere” does not offer a reason to preserve the trees and streams. At some intermediate level, natural settings are important for spiritual experiences. Yet at an advanced level, seeing God everywhere means that God is also in the parking lots and shopping malls.</p>
<p>As we have seen in actual Hasidic communities, the belief that God is everywhere goes quite well with a total disregard for the material world, and, at the very least, a lot of littering. Focused on a higher beauty, many Hasidim pay little attention to the “lower” forms. Our ecological consciousness must come from elsewhere.<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The famous sociologist Peter Berger is retired but still blogs about religious ideas that catch his eye. Berger, in his classic <em>The Sacred Canopy</em> (1967) explained how Eastern European immigrants to the US, lost their shtetl sacred canopy and thereby replaced their old faith with the pluralism of America. Now everyone as moderns is autonomous and makes decisions that create a personal functional sacred canopy. The major thing that one gets from the book is that we are all now conscious of our ability to choose and choose we must. Nothing is destiny or compelling us anymore.<br />
In this blog post, it seems that Berger has just discovered that post 1967 Judaism with its emphasis on Holocaust and Zionism as well as the renewed vigor of Orthodoxy uses the language of destiny, compelled by community and God, and not choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>I occasionally pick up The Jerusalem Post at the famous out-of-town newspaper kiosk on Harvard Square (for ongoing news about the Middle East I rely on its very informative sister publication The Jerusalem Report). In the current international edition my attention was immediately grabbed by a big advertisement on the very first page of the paper. The headline of the ad reads “Jews in America… Wake Up! Anti-Semitism is Raising its Ugly Head Once Again”</p>
<p>There is an intrinsic tension between destiny and choice in that definition. In traditional Judaism to be a Jew is a destiny grounded in God’s covenant with the people of Israel – the individual does not choose to enter into this covenant, but is bound to it by the fact of birth. The Jews have not chosen God; He has chosen them. </p>
<p>But as more and more Jews entered the mainstream of American society a world of choices opened up to them. Willy-nilly they became part of the turbulent pluralism of this society. Of course they could choose to belong to a traditional Jewish community that continued to affirm the destiny of belonging to the people of the Covenant – but, paradoxically, this affirmation of destiny is itself chosen, no longer to be taken for granted. The individual can certainly choose what kind of Judaism to affiliate with – America has produced the historically unparalleled phenomenon of a whole emporium of Jewish denominations (a profoundly American term). The individual can also choose to be a secular Jew, or choose any number of non-Jewish religious affiliations (not only Christian ones – a surprising number of American Buddhists are of Jewish origin), or for that matter choose to be religiously unaffiliated and ethnically vague. And all these choices are protected by law, understood as rights by the larger culture (“it’s a free country!”), and solemnly legitimated by the democratic ideology of the American republic.</p>
<p>Jewish identity as destiny is also affirmed by reference to the Holocaust and to the state of Israel. There are problems with both references. While remembrance of the Holocaust can be seen as a moral duty (I agree with this), the very horror of these events can have the opposite effect – namely, the effect of wanting to have nothing to do with it. Ruth Wisse, who teaches Yiddish literature at Harvard, expressed her uneasiness with the spread of Holocaust studies in American academia by questioning whether young people should relate to Jewish history by focusing on its most terrible period. As to grounding Jewish identity in solidarity with the state of Israel, the taken-for-granted character of this identity will be most plausibly maintained to the degree that Israel conforms to the idealistic aspirations of the Zionist vision. Many American Jews have had difficulties with this vision in the decades since the triumphant Israeli victory in the 1967 war.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the assertion, that anti-Semitism is inexorable and ubiquitous, occupies a strategic place in any effort to make Jewish identity a matter of destiny rather than choice. If even in America a recurrence of Nazi-like anti-Semitism is likely or unavoidable, Jewish identity is indeed a matter of destiny from which there is no escape. </p>
<p>It is always perilous to anchor an identity in a definition of the situation which goes against the empirical realities. It seems to me that Jewish identity, whether understood in religious or ethnic terms, should not deny the choices made possible by American pluralism – and indeed should affirm the value of freedom by which these choices are legitimated. The long history of Judaism and of Jewish culture provides ample resources for making plausible a choice for Jewish identity. To see America today through the lens of Germany in the 1930s is a delusion – a thoroughly counter-productive one.</p>
<p>Could this change? Of course it could. Every catastrophe is possible. But it would be extremely foolish to pretend that a possible catastrophe is now happening or is about to happen, and even more foolish to act on the pretense. Put differently, hypochondria is not a good method of health care.</p>
<p>Quite a few years ago I was on a panel with a prominent American rabbi. I don’t recall what the panel was about. All I recall is a brief exchange I had with the rabbi. He said that he was telling his children that the Holocaust could happen in America. He turned to me and asked whether I thought that he was paranoid. I replied that, on the contrary, he was not paranoid enough. He could only imagine being killed because he is a Jew. Depending on circumstances, he might be killed because he is an American, or a bourgeois, or white. I did not add that he might well be doing psychological damage to his children. I don’t remember whether or how he responded. <a href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/berger/2011/01/12/jewish-identity-in-america/">Read his entire post here.</a></p></blockquote>

				<p>Jerusalem Post article &#8211; A bit overstated but it has a point. There are some Orthodox Jews who do go into music and art, and there are kippot at Lincoln Center &#8211; it is not all or nothing. We have to distinguish between the two points the author is making- that few Orthodox kids go into the arts and that the community is philistine and wedded to pop culture.<br />
His answer about courage is not the issue; his answer about risk aversion seems more to the point. Anyone who wants certainty in values, certainty in religion, and certainty in society-which are the reasons many choose Orthodoxy- would want certainty in the rest of their lives. But why the be philistine? There are many European orthodox in the Hirschian tradition, that are even more stiff and certain but appreciate the arts.<br />
It is not the shomer shabbat question because in Israel they have founded Orthodox art and music HS&#8217;s and one can attend the arts on other days of the week. And if there was talent and desire, then people would find a way.</p>
<blockquote><p>Guest Columnist: US Orthodoxy and fear of the arts<br />
By JJ GROSS 14/01/2011<br />
How can a society that crams the classes of law schools and medical schools barely yield a single poet or painter?</p>
<p>After making aliya last March, I started taking clarinet lessons at the Academy of Music and Dance, this country’s answer to Juilliard. Unsurprisingly, my instructor, Gadi, is a graduate student at the academy. What might surprise my friends in New York – as it did me – was his kippa.</p>
<p>In New York, one cannot find an Orthodox teacher at a serious conservatory. In fact, the likelihood of finding a classically trained Orthodox clarinetist in the Big Apple hovers at about zero.</p>
<p>As the weeks progressed, I realized that Gadi was hardly an anomaly. At the academy I noticed young kippa-wearing violinists, cellists, pianists and more. And surely there were at least as many Orthodox young women.</p>
<p>In fact, music is not the only art in which Orthodox Israelis are represented. Here one finds Orthodox painters, filmmakers, composers, writers and poets. In America? Forget about it! A celebrated fiction writer who is also a rosh yeshiva? In America, unthinkable. Here there’s Haim Sabato.</p>
<p>What’s more, Israel boasts a boys yeshiva-music high school, an Orthodox girls art high school, an Orthodox film school, and even a haredi classical conservatory for girls – not to mention myriad observant students at major art academies.</p>
<p>The hermetic absence of Orthodox Americans in the arts has long troubled me. There has never been a society without its quota of creative spirits. African tribes, barbarians in medieval Europe, aborigines in New Zealand, Indians in Central America have always had their dancers, musicians, artists and storytellers. Orthodox Jews in America? Nada.</p>
<p> Art is not a luxury. It is a necessary vitamin, if not our oxygen.</p>
<p>Indeed, both the modern Orthodox and the yeshivish borrow their celebratory and liturgical music exclusively from the hassidic world. And one often finds hassidic paintings on modern Orthodox walls. Kitsch? Maybe. But still.</p>
<p>How can a society that crams the classes of law schools and medical schools barely yield a single poet or painter? One explanation must be the prohibitive cost of being religious in America. The price of admission to Orthodox society for a family of four is a combined household income in the top 2%. </p>
<p>Understandably, Orthodox parents steer their children into lucrative professions rather than encouraging them to do what they love (and I include the sciences as well). The word “muse” is not part of their vocabulary. Even the rabbinate and Jewish pedagogy are spurned by the best and brightest, as these do not pay enough to make Jewish life affordable. It shows in the quality of American rabbis and day-school teachers who, with a few noteworthy exceptions, are distressingly average.</p>
<p>I believe the answer is courage. Diaspora Jews are not blessed with a surfeit of courage. They are geniuses at risk aversion. They choose safety in numbers, safety in professions, safety in neighborhoods, safety in the cars they drive. None ride motorcycles.</p>
<p>Choosing painting over law, music over medical school, writing over banking takes courage. One chooses an art because it is a passion, not because it comes with a guarantee. </p>
<p>American Orthodox teens are fast-tracked into college and narrow-tracked into law school or dental school&#8230; And if their gift is playing oboe or videography, they don’t have frightened parents and gutless pedagogues weaning them into life with a safety net.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I just submitted my overdue <a href="../../../../2009/09/22/maharal-at-huc-and-beyond/index.html">Maharal paper from the 2009 conference</a> and now continue on my examination of <a href="../../../../2010/12/27/religion-and-popular-culture-rescripting-the-sacred/index.html">popular culture. </a> and <a href="../../../../2011/01/11/more-on-the-rock-and-roll-shabbaton/index.html">rock and roll Orthodoxy.</a></p>
<p>1] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Border-Crossings-Christian-Trespasses-Popular/dp/1587430037">Rodney Clapp&#8217;s &#8216;Border Crossings</a> affirms that and that  forays into other areas of public culture (across &#8220;borders&#8221;) should be undertaken first and foremost as Christians. Popular culture has gone mainstream in the US and religion has been swept up into popular culture  American evangelicals have got to stop being so rational and seemingly intellectual, it wont reach anyone. It assumes people we disagree with are “benighted or ill-intentioned.&#8221; He says the plan of identifying with American culture leaves no alternative if it fails. Clapp instead wants greater emphasis on community and worship and less on individual belief or individual practice.<br />
What about the future? Clapp wants greater involvement in culture but as religious people.What does a film or jazz piece teach? How does it help our journey? </p>
<p><strong>Any thoughts on the application of this to orthodoxy?</strong> It seems higher education as in Mada is opposed to Torah, but popular culture seems to be synthesized well with Torah. Can we make any of Torah as counter popular culture? </p>
<blockquote><p>Rodney Clapp&#8217;s &#8216;Border Crossings&#8217; says that everything evangelicals think they know about American culture is wrong.<br />
For this baby boomer, it&#8217;s jarring, and a little unsettling, to see Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s &#8220;Voodoo Child, Part II&#8221; being used to sell a truck. Wasn&#8217;t rock and roll&#8211;at least the good stuff&#8211;supposed to be about maintaining a critical distance from corruptive influences such as the marketplace?<br />
American evangelicalism (specifically, the white suburban variety) is even more captive in this regard than is the music of Hendrix.<br />
Christians should work at being an alternative to the &#8220;technologically-oriented&#8221; and &#8220;consumer-based&#8221; mainstream culture.</p>
<p>According to Clapp, evangelicals believe that Christian truths are &#8220;available to rationally able, well-intended individuals quite apart from any particular tradition or social context.&#8221; It may be hard to believe in our post-&#8220;Inherit the Wind&#8221; world, but evangelical faith is indeed dominated by a kind of rationalism, which says that the content of evangelical faith is expressed in propositions supposedly accessible to any &#8220;well-intended individual.&#8221; The Bible is a sort of instruction manual, albeit one sometimes more difficult to interpret than what comes with Ikea furniture.</p>
<p>Clapp is saying that almost everything American evangelicals know about relating to their non-evangelical contemporaries is wrong, or at least outdated. Other Americans share neither their spiritual aspirations nor their moral reasoning. Sticking to the &#8220;foundationalist&#8221; script is not only unproductive, it&#8217;s counterproductive. Why? Because in addition to assuming something about your interlocutor that isn&#8217;t true, it &#8220;inclines us towards believing that those who disagree are necessarily benighted or ill-intentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evangelical faith places huge emphasis on the individual and the idea of a personal relationship with God. And the less said about liturgy, the better.<br />
With no real sense of what it means to be the church&#8211;what Christians call an ecclesiology&#8211;evangelicals depend on being American&#8211;and Americans being Christian&#8211;as their sole source of a corporate identity. Little wonder so much of the &#8220;religious right&#8217;s&#8221; rhetoric is characterized by fear and sense of crisis. There&#8217;s no plan &#8220;B.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Books/2000/12/Re-Contextualizing-Christianity.aspx#ixzz1BF1yX3VE">Full review here.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>2] Another Book on the topic- this one argues that youth leaders should strive for something deeper than entertainment.<br />
In <a href="http://www.congregationalresources.org/growing-souls-experiments-contemplative-youth-ministry">Growing Souls Mark Yaconelli </a>reaches beyond <strong>the tendency for youth pastors to make ministry to adolescents an exercise in entertainment.</strong> He believes both adolescents and those who work with them are longing for &#8220;deeper, more authentic forms of … discipleship&#8221; but that traditional approaches don&#8217;t cultivate this</p>
<p>3] Finally, I wish to discuss the SNL sketch from last night.<br />
The sketch opened and closed with a nice shot of Park East Synagogue. The sketch itself made fun of the 1980’s Bar Mizvah’s that were all Bar and no Torah. Garish Bar Mitzvah’s of entertainment, hiring Hollywood stars, sports figures,  rock musicians, wild themes and high budgets. Nick Kroll, better known as the caveman of Geico commercials,  helped produce a humorous documentary book on the topic a few years ago, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bar-Mitzvah-Disco-Stopped-Partys/dp/1400080444">Bar Mizvah Disco.</a></p>
<p>25 years later these bar mizvah&#8217;s seems not religious, garish and devoid of Torah and spirituality- everything that made people leave their suburban and predominately Conservative congregations. But at the same time, these events kept people in the synagogue, they served to show the relevance of Judaism.If people were into ostentatious wealth, then they found a way to keep it in the synagogue.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/fashion/sundaystyles/23BAR.html">NYT wrote about the book</a> in 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>During this period, Mr. Neuman said, &#8220;the country clubs that used to not want to have us as members want us as members.&#8221; So the proud new members of the Cadillac-driving gentry began organizing religious ceremonies around &#8220;enduring American themes,&#8221; he continued..&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Part of the move to the suburbs is seen as a step to being more integrated with your non-Jewish neighbors,&#8221; Dr. Shandler said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a family celebration. It becomes a kind of mega birthday party. Parents are using this as a social occasion, so their business associates and neighbors get invited to the celebration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now to what I really want to ask. Here is the SNL clip making fun of one of these Bar-Mitzvah. The father in the skit says that we do tis because we can afford it and to entertain the guests. Meaning that they see that Jews don’t have to be excluded, they can have everything in popular culture.  <strong>How is this different than a Rock and Roll Shabbaton? In both there are rock performers instead of Torah. If you answer kiruv and getting people into shul, I can say the same thing about the 1980’s bar mitzvah. People wanted to be part of these suburban Jewish centers because it allowed to do the things that interested them. Both assumed that once in the door the rabbi would teach them more about Judaism. So what is the difference?</strong></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Today&#8217;s NYT had a nice piece about an Orthodox Dance Ensemble just for men.  You can go to their <a href="http://www.othermove.com/?lat=en">Ka&#8217;et website</a> to find out their bios and pieces they perform as well as the schedule of courses.  <a href="http://ko-kr.connect.facebook.com/pages/Kaet-Ensemble-nsmbl-kt/152254648158622">Facebook page of Ka&#8217;et</a> Israeli Religious Zionists have created a film school and teach film and poetry in their high schools, here is another element for them to create a rich expressionistic religious life. This are the types of arts which American Orthodoxy lacks. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/arts/dance/16kaet.html">Whirling Along The Borders Of Israeli Life By JANICE ROSS</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the epitome of this effort is Ka’et, a group of five Orthodox men working under the direction of a Tel Aviv choreographer, Ronen Izhaki. Together they create spare yet emotionally rich work that takes gestures from daily prayer movements along with chants and synagogue attire, and gently shifts and reframes these elements as postmodern dance. It’s a savvy move, reflecting both the explosive body of Ohad Naharin’s choreography and its social opposite, the trancelike swaying of devout Jews in deep prayer. “We are using the stage to awaken a new discussion between our lives and our bodies,” said Amitai Stern, 25, the youngest member of the group.</p>
<p>The men of Ka’et (a Hebrew acronym that means “timely”) are not professional dancers. In their 20s and 30s, some have families; all have day jobs — one is a rabbi at a yeshiva, another works with runaways from ultra-Orthodox homes. But when they made their debut in the fall at the Lab, an important alternative space in Jerusalem, and afterward in sold-out concerts elsewhere, their lack of performing experience didn’t matter. They presented an astonishingly intense dance, “Highway No. 1,” with movement, costumes and sound score taken from Jewish religious practice.</p>
<p>Starting with Emmanuel Witzthum’s techno music overlaid with chanted Kabbalah passages, the dance revealed prayer as not just its medium but also its subject. The men, barefoot and wearing worn slacks and shirts, sway softly, palms forward, eyes rolled back, lips moving noiselessly. Suddenly one begins accelerating his movements. With growing agitation he tries to climb over the others clustered around him — like a sleepwalker driven by a disturbing dream. The ensemble responds reflexively, folding his swimming arms down to his sides and pressing him back into a posture of quiet prayer without breaking the steady rocking motions of their own davening.</p>
<p>When a group of religious men from Mr. Izhaki’s dance school saw a performance, several chuckled out loud at this passage. “It reminds me exactly of when I am praying and an errant thought keeps trying to interrupt me,” one of them, Yuval Azulay, said. “You try to put it aside and get back to the focus of the prayer, but it keeps coming back.”</p>
<p>“Highway No. 1” takes its title from the road connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, which epitomize the secular and religious in Israel. “If you work in Jerusalem with religious people, you are right wing,” Mr. Izhaki, 38, said. “And if you live in Tel Aviv and are a dancer, you are left wing and a vegetarian. But I didn’t take the package with either of those.”</p>
<p>The men’s ability to draw religious and secular Israelis into the same theater for a dance performance is highly unusual. Alon Ben-Yaacov, a tour guide and the one member of Ka’et who wears long payos, the side curls of Orthodox Jews, said it took three years for his family members to understand that he wanted to dance, but now, he said, they are supportive.<br />
Hananya Schwartz, the young rabbi in Ka’et, was anxious about his own rabbi’s seeing him dance onstage. His anxiety wasn’t entirely misplaced: after the performance, his rabbi quoted a passage from the Talmud that Mr. Schwartz said could be summed up as “interesting but you are wasting your time.”</p>
<p> &#8230; and all of the men said they were looking for a way to teach movement in yeshivas and religious centers.<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>For the last few months,  I have been thinking about how to organize the material coming into my feed about brain death. My most basic comment is to point out that the Catholic Church is also busy defining the time of death. After the Terry Schiavo case, they realize that they did not have clear enough decisions. So in 2008-2010, there have been speeches, documents and Catholic policy papers on brain death. Catholic run hospitals are the largest group of hospitals in the US. The question is whether they will adopt a theory of human nature approach or a casuistry approach for the final documents.</p>
<p>Another set of documents relates to the changes in the President’s Commission on Bioethics, there have been major changes from the <a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/">Bush commission </a>to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-4-7-10">Obama commission.</a> (You can read the papers and transcripts <a href="http://www.bioethics.gov/transcripts/">here</a> and <a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/transcripttopic.html">here.</a>) But also the change from clergy as bioethicists to professional bioethicists and now a majority are physicians and scientists. Pay attention when you a read a statement if it is by a scientist, a clergy acting as a scientist, or a clergy speaking from religion. Also pay attention if the new clergy statements are following Bush or Obama President’s Commission on Bioethics guidelines and visions. In this set of documents, I also should mention the Congressional debates over end-of life panels.</p>
<p>The current perspective for those in theology, hospice, or those wanted to give a religious meaning to death is return to a deathbed and a natural acceptance of death. People feel there has been too much medical intervention in our lives. <a href="../../../../2010/06/08/paul-griffiths-on-death/index.html">Here is a prior post on the topic</a> with two thoughtful comments.</p>
<p>These debates about the definition of end of life have bothered moderns for 250 years already. 19<sup>th</sup> century Europeans projected their anxiety of burying still alive people onto vampire stories and tales from the crypt. The famous Schwerin debate between Mendelssohn and Emden was over end of life, Mendelssohn claiming that someone can still be alive in coma and life takes precedent over burial customs.  </p>
<p>Post WWII Twentieth Century thinking tended to be infatuated with medicine and trusted the doctor; there are several excellent books on that topic. Now there is a greater skepticism toward physicians as deciding the big question of end of life. Whichever way the brain death issues of 2008-2012  get settled, it is only for a few decades. Know that the question will most likely be opened up at least twice more within the next hundred years. </p>
<p>American newspapers set this as a personal choice and do not usually reflect on the complex weave created by a religious affiliation hospital, and the religious affiliations of the doctors and nurses in the mix. The Catholics involved in health care that I know are familiar with the writings of Fred Rosner and the Jews are familiar with Catholic Bishops statements.</p>
<p>So I was delighted when I was saved the trouble of organizing my links by the post last Thursday by Religion Link, a service that gives resources for papers to write articles on religion. Many papers take the bait and in three weeks one can compare how various papers covered the same religion story from the same sources.  I will give selections from a <a href="http://www.religionlink.com/tip_110114.php">much longer Religion Link post.</a> As you can see, the post gives lots of great links.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://www.religionlink.com/tip_110114.php">Defining brain death and sparking a health care debate</a></strong><br />
Posted on January 12th, 2011</p>
<p>The Obama administration’s decision to halt regulations authorizing end-of-life counseling through Medicare once again shows how politically fraught the issue can be in the wake of the health care reform controversy over so-called death panels. But knotty issues remain for ethicists and religious groups on what constitutes brain death and the end of life.</p>
<p>The renewed debate can be traced to technological advances and new brain research, and also to questions being raised by believers, particularly in Catholicism and Judaism.</p>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI and Vatican officials have in <a href="http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/209766?eng=y" target="_blank">recent years questioned</a> whether “brain death” is an adequate marker to determine biological death.</p>
<p>Caring for people in the final stages of life is one of the most expensive aspects of the nation’s health care system, accounting for as much as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69C3KY20101014" target="_blank">one-third of all health care costs</a>, and about 30 percent of Medicare expenditures come in the last year of a patient’s life. Moreover, modern medicine is able to keep human beings — or at least their bodies — alive for increasingly long periods, often in what is known as a “persistent vegetative state,” or PVS.</p>
<p>This comes as the nation’s population continues to grow grayer, with the responsibility of providing for the terminally ill falling on the next generation, and on strained state and federal budgets.</p>
<p>Americans last engaged in widespread public discussion about the emotional topic of people in a “persistent vegetative state” in 2005, during the protracted and acrimonious national debate over the fate of Terri Schiavo.</p>
<p>At that time, Schiavo’s husband, Michael Schiavo, decided to remove the feeding tube that had kept the severely brain-injured woman alive — though unconscious and unresponsive –- for 15 years. Her parents strongly objected and took legal action to prevent the move. Michael prevailed after weeks of rancorous dispute that eventually involved national politicians as well as religious figures, ethical experts and, ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court. Points of contention included whether and how Terri Schiavo had expressed her desires about her situation, whether her condition justified steps that would have the effect of ending her life, and who had the right to decide. The recent developments in medical technology and ethics involve each of these issues.</p>
<p>In the brain imaging study published in February 2010, British and Belgian researchers reported on studies of 54 persistently unconscious individuals. In five of these people, a brain-imaging machine revealed particular patterns of brain activity that occurred after researchers asked “yes” or “no” questions to the patients. “A small proportion of patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state have brain activation reflecting some awareness and cognition,” the article states. The technique “may be useful in establishing basic communication with patients who appear to be unresponsive.” But an editorial in the Journal cautioned families of brain-injured patients against taking from these results any unfounded hope that the patients with severe brain injuries can improve.</p>
<p>In November 2009, the nation’s Catholic bishops issued new guidelines on care of terminally ill patients in Catholic hospitals that tightened standards to prevent the actions taken in Schiavo’s case from occurring in institutions under church control. The new policies would make refusal or removal of feeding tubes and some other life-sustaining measures more difficult and, many observers believe, conflict with the desires — and even the legally valid directives — of some patients to have such measures ended or never begun. “In principle, there is an obligation to provide patients with food and water, including medically assisted nutrition and hydration for those who cannot take food orally,” states the document, Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. “This obligation extends to patients in chronic and presumably irreversible conditions (e.g., the “persistent vegetative state”) who can reasonably be expected to live indefinitely if given such care.”</p>
<p>These standards, however, differ sharply from the general practices of American hospitals, which permit end-of-life decisions that include withholding of nutrition and hydration if such comports with the express wish of the patient. Observers therefore predict the probability of conflict between the new guidance and the desires and decisions of many dying individuals and their families.</p>
<ul>
<li>The      University of Miami’s second Global Business Forum, held Jan. 12-14, 2011,      explored <a href="http://www.bus.miami.edu/events/gbf2011/index.html" target="_blank">“The Business of Health Care: Defining the Future”</a> and      included a panel titled “Care Models, Economics and Ethics of End of Life      Decision Making.”</li>
<li>On Jan. 6,      2011, the Obama administration <a href="http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/01/obama_admin_rev.html" target="_blank">reversed course</a> on end-of-life counseling regulations      due to concerns that they would revive the “death panels” controversy.</li>
<li>Research <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0905370" target="_blank">reported      in the February 2010 edition</a> of <em>The New England Journal of      Medicine</em> indicates that some individuals with brain damage      previously thought to prevent thought, consciousness and communication in      fact possess previously unsuspected levels of awareness. Even if aided by      advanced technology, they have the ability to answer questions accurately.      Experts caution that this dealt with a small percentage of patients in PVS      and that hopes for a recovery for these patients were vanishingly small.</li>
<li>In      November 2009 the Catholic bishops of the United States issued guidance to      Catholic hospitals banning the removal of nutrition and hydration from      patients who would survive if they were provided. That has raised concerns      that advance directives could be ignored in Catholic hospitals if they      conflict with Catholic policies. There are more than 600 Catholic medical      facilities in the United States, the largest single private provider of      health care in the country.</li>
<li>Catholic      teaching on the definition of death and the ethics of organ harvesting      appears to be in flux. In the latter half of 2008 the issue came to the      fore when <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804529.htm" target="_blank">the Vatican newspaper</a> published a front-page column      calling for a re-examination of the definition of brain death. Subsequently,      Pope Benedict XVI delivered <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4A658820081107" target="_blank">an      address</a> to a Vatican conference on organ donation in which he said      that “where certainty has not been reached the principle of precaution must      prevail.”</li>
<li>In October      2009, <em>Nature</em> magazine published <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7264/full/461570a.html" target="_blank">an editorial</a> calling for a “realistic definition of      life’s end” in order to facilitate the harvesting and donation of organs,      among other things. The editorial sums up the current laws and policies      and the state of the debate.</li>
