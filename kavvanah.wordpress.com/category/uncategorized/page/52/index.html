				<p>I received an email notice this morning for a brand new <a href="http://www.har-el.org/">Har&#8217;EL Yeshiva</a> that will combine the traditional Beit midrash with being a seeker. It will bring Hasidut, creative writing, Moreh Nevukhim, and great books in the Beit Midrash.The Rosh Yeshiva will be Rabbi Herzl Hefter (no ad hominem). Any thoughts?</p>
<p>From the Website -only some of this was in the email.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past 200 years, the world has seen more change than in the previous 5000.  These changes pose acute challenges for our faith and traditional way of life, as we hold tenaciously to our sacred traditions while fearlessly engaging a new reality.  To deal with those challenges, I am excited to announce the opening of Har’El Yeshiva, a new program for sincere and motivated young men between the ages of 21 and 30 in the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>(1) What we believe:<br />
The Torah teaches that God created the world and human beings with imperfections.  Facing our individual and communal imperfections honestly is the necessary first step to any sort of authentic relationship with ourselves (as individuals), with each other and with God.</p>
<p>We are driven by the conviction that love and devotion to Torah study transforms the individual into a more perfect reflection of Godliness.<br />
 At Har’El Yeshiva, we seek to confront challenges openly because we believe that this is our unique responsibility. We believe that love of Torah should develop love of truth and personal growth.</p>
<p>“Existential” Torah<br />
In the post modern era where all authority is suspect, it is insufficient to base religious observance upon obedience alone. Morning seder will commence with the study of Hasidic teachings. This is designed to provide meaningful context for the activities of the rest of the day. We will study the powerful and transformative works of the Mei haShiloah, R. Zadok Hakohen of Lublin and the Sefat Emet. These masters teach that God is present in the human heart. The immediacy of the Divine in the human heart feeds a sense of urgency to facilitate its revelation through the study of Torah, prayer and fear of Heaven. The consciousness of radical Divine immanence provides an authentic traditional framework to absorb the far reaching changes in human society over the last two hundred years.</p>
<p>Students will be inspired to internalize the Torah and make it their own, learning to express themselves creatively.  We will encourage our students to draw upon their life experiences to develop their avodat hashem and yir’at shamayim.</p>
<p>Guide to the Perplexed<br />
The Yeshiva will combine intellectual rigor and God-consciousness. This approach is embodied in Maimonides’ Guide to the Perplexed. Generally, mysticism has a complete disdain for the dry demands of logic and language. But, in his work, Maimonides starts from a place of cool Aristotelian rationalism, and follows a course of rigid reasoning about God’s perfection and about the nature of language. Eventually, he comes to the realization that language and logic do have their limits; that reality and religious experience do outstrip the descriptive powers of language; and that silent reverence of a God that cannot be described is the only appropriate attitude. This course will concentrate on these themes, and on Maimonides’ rationalization of the commandments. In his work, we will see an old-fashioned Aristotelianism that nevertheless reaches the same conclusions that Kant and Wittgenstein would later reach.</p>
<p>Writing workshop<br />
In the creative writing workshop, we will deepen our religious and Jewish identity through the medium of creativity.  Each session will begin with learning a short passage from one of the traditional Jewish texts: a midrash, a Hasidic story, a short passage from the Guide to the Perplexed, etc. This text will then be the springboard for the actual writing exercise, which will always try to focus on a Jewish theme.   Rabbi Nachman wrote that “the imagination is the cornerstone of faith.”  We believe that the imagination can be a gateway for a person to enter the palace of devekut and faith.</p>
<p>Great books<br />
Pursuant to our intention to prepare our students to engage the world, we will  integrate the following subjects into the yeshiva curriculum   in a way which will not compromise the intensity of the Torah studies.  We will produce a reading list of essential books on these subjects. The students will meet regularly to discuss these books. At times students themselves will be responsible to moderate the discussion.<br />
A partial list of great books:<br />
    Descartes, “Meditations on First Philosophy”<br />
    John Stuart Mill, “On Liberty”<br />
    Sigmund Freud, “The Psychopathology of Everyday Life”<br />
    Adam Smith, “The Wealth of Nations”<br />
    John Kenneth Galbraith, “The Affluent Society”<br />
    Ian Barbour, “Science and Religion”<br />
    Mircea Eliade, “The Myth of the Eternal Return”<br />
Students will be expected to present to their peers.  They will write their presentation for posting on our website.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="http://www.har-el.org/">Yeshivat Har&#8217;El here.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the first dvar Torah that they placed on their web- about the need for a personal calling.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Sefat Emet says that G-d is continuously calling to each and every one of us: “Lech lecha! – ‘Get thee out!” What differentiates Avraham is that he heard the call.</p>
<p>When we reflect upon the Biblical personalities who hear the voice of God, our first instinct is to think of the call in a literal way, sound waves echoing in the prophet’s inner ear.  The Sefat Emet says that this is not so.  Rather, God’s voice resonates within each of us, calling us to our spiritual journey. As creatures created in the Divine image, we are charged to attune ourselves to the Divine calling that echoes in our hearts and minds.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There is a nice article in today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/books/82555/camus-the-jew/">Tablet on Camus and the Jews.</a> It shows his closeness to the Jewish Resistance, his support of Israel, and his Biblical philosophy of absurdity. A study of the influence of major influence of Camus on modern Jewish thought is a desideratum. Much of Holocaust thought -Amery, Wiesel, Fackenheim- is based on Camus. Camus is mixed with Buber in Berkovits, Soloveitchik, and others. And there is a nice volume of Camus Biblical exegesis written by Andre Neher, <em>Exile of the Word.</em> Long term, I am working on an article on Camus in Wiesel&#8217;s Hasidic stories.  </p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, he began to reach out to Jewish friends. To one, Irène Djian, he denounced these “despicable” laws and reassured her: “This wind cannot last if each and every one of us calmly affirmed that the wind smells rotten.” He reminded her he would always stand by her—a remarkable position for a Frenchman to take in 1940, when the vast majority of his compatriots either embraced or accepted the new laws. </p>
<p>Among the few visitors he had was his friend the historian André Chouraqui, a French Algerian Jew whom Camus peppered with questions about the Old Testament, all the while taking notes for the book he was then writing, The Plague.</p>
<p>By then, Chouraqui was already risking his life in the French Resistance, particularly in the critical work of finding homes for Jewish refugee children. Much of this activity centered on Chambon, where the pastor, André Trocmé, had already mobilized the village in the work of welcoming, housing, and hiding these children. By the end of the war, the people of Chambon had saved the lives of at least 3,000 Jewish children and adults.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is the theme of absurdity that most powerfully underscores Camus’ understanding of Jews, Judaism, and Israel. At the political and existential level, Camus felt a visceral connection with the absurd predicament of the young Jewish state. It was a political bond insofar as many on the French left, from whom Camus was estranged, had grown deeply anti-Zionist in the wake of the Suez War. In 1957, he publicly affirmed his sympathy and support for Israel. His reasons still echo today: Not only must Europe accept Israel’s existence as the only possible response to the continent’s complicity in the Final Solution, but Israel must also exist as a counter-example to the oppressive rule of Arab leaders. The Arab people, he declared, wished for deserts covered with olive trees, not canons. Let Israel show the way.</p>
<p>His plea for cooperation and collaboration between Jews and Arabs in Israel echoed his pleas to his fellow pied-noirs and Arabs in Algeria. </p>
<p>Yet Camus’ deepest and most intriguing bond to Judaism is revealed in his philosophy of the absurd. In early 1941, when Vichy was preparing a second round of anti-Semitic legislation and the papers in France and Algeria were giving free rein to anti-Semitic rhetoric, Camus completed his philosophical essay “The Myth of Sisyphus.” The opening lines are among the best known written by Camus: “There is just one truly important philosophical question: suicide. To decide whether life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question of philosophy. Everything else … is child’s play; we must first of all answer the question.” Of course that question needed to be answered in 1941. How could it be otherwise, given the dire predicament in which the French and French Jews, along with Camus, found themselves?</p>
<p>Job and Sisyphus, in short, are heaved into a world shorn of transcendence and meaning. In response to their demand for answers, they get only silence. Herein lies the absurdity, Camus writes: It is “the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. For the moment it is all that links them together.”</p>
<p>The silence of the world, in effect, only becomes silence when human beings enter the equation. All too absurdly, Job demands meaning. “Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard/ I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.” And no less absurdly, Job must ask himself what he must do if meaning is not to be found? What is our next step if meaning fails to show up at our appointed rendezvous? “But where shall wisdom be found?/ And where is the place of understanding?”</p>
<p>He is a Job who answers God’s deafening and dismal effort at self-justification with scornful silence.<br />

				<p>A Guest Post by Rabbi Avraham Bronstein- He is considering a year of Occupy Parsha.<br />
Rabbi Avraham Bronstein currently serves as Program Director of the Great Neck Synagogue. He previously served as Assistant Rabbi of The Hampton Synagogue where he developed and coordinated the extensive Cultural and Adult-Educational Program.</p>
<p><strong>Sermon: Occupy Noah</strong> </p>
<p>Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks <a href="http://bit.ly/vS6rNv">wrote on Parshat Noach:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Flood tells us what happens to civilization when individuals rule and there is no collective&#8230;It was Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), the thinker who laid the foundations of modern politics in his classic Leviathan (1651), who – without referring to the Flood – gave it its best interpretation. Before there were political institutions, said Hobbes, human beings were in a “state of nature.” They were individuals, packs, bands. Lacking a stable ruler, an effective government and enforceable laws, people would be in a state of permanent and violent chaos – “a war of every man against every man” – as they competed for scarce resources. There would be “continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Such situations exist today in a whole series of failed or failing states. That is precisely the Torah’s description of life before the Flood. When there is no rule of law to constrain individuals, the world is filled with violence.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I read Sack&#8217;s piece, I got the sense that making his point about failed states or chaotic, violent societies really takes the bite out of the narrative. It teaches us a lesson we already know about, say, Rwanda, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily teach us about ourselves. If anything, we come away with a false assurance, almost a cultural triumphalism.</p>
<p>Instead, I would argue that the pre-Flood landscape Sacks calls &#8220;Hobbesian&#8221; is actually much closer to Wall Street, 2011 than Iraq, 2005. Our new Guilded Age, with its vast wealth and innovation but gaping chasm between haves and have-nots, is the direct result of an unregulated &#8220;war of every many against every man,&#8221; where the winners wield the political process itself as a weapon, using their resources to ensure that it represents their interests as opposed to those of society at large.</p>
<p>The Rabbis were eerily sensitive to this in their own depiction of the pre-Flood society. They describe a remarkable situation where, despite an environment of amazing prosperity, people were robbed of the opportunity to succeed:</p>
<p>The wantonness of this generation was in a measure due to the ideal conditions under which mankind lived before the flood. They knew neither toil nor care, and as a consequence of their extraordinary prosperity they grew insolent&#8230;.So cunningly were their depredations planned that the law could not touch them. If a countryman brought a basket of vegetables to market, they would edge up to it, one after the other, and abstract a bit, each in itself of petty value, but in a little while the dealer would have none left to sell.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a great imagination to make the jump to deceptive ATM fees, crippling student loans, punitive foreclosure procedures, and taxpayer bailouts of &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; financial institutions. The laws on the books that provide no protection to the weak nor accountability for the powerful ring strikingly familiar as well.</p>
<p>The amount of overall wealth in our society is truly staggering, yet our culture&#8217;s blinding focus on individualism has resulted in both the rich getting richer and social mobility becoming harder. In short, the &#8220;hamas/corruption&#8221; that doomed the world to the Flood was not Bernie Madoff &#8211; it was AIG and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>The Rabbis, as is well known, were ambivalent about Noah as a character:</p>
<p>“These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous, innocent man in his generation” (Gen 6:9). Rashi: “in his generations.” Some of our Sages expound this to his praise: all the more so had he lived in a generation of righteous people, he would have been even more righteous. And there are those who expound it to his defamation: by the standard of his generation he was righteous, but had he lived in the generation of Abraham he would have been considered as nothing.</p>
<p>The most damning critique of Noah for those who thought less highly of him was his silent acceptance of the Flood without protest. In contrast to Abraham who forcefully resisted God&#8217;s plan to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gemorah, at possible risk to himself, Noah quietly built his Ark, content to save himself. He may have assured himself that his neighbors and associates deserved their fate, or he may not have really thought about it much at all.</p>
<p>I would argue that, according to this reading, Noah perfectly embodied the harshly individualistic culture of his generation. The same lack of shared responsibility than enabled Noah&#8217;s peers to steal each others vegetables blinded him to his responsibility to society at large. In fact, his success came at their expense. Noah may well have been righteous, but he was certainly &#8220;in his generation.&#8221; There are surely many Noahs in our world today, people who live privately decent lives but do not address the systemic failures and injustices of the system. Noah demonstrates a passive &#8220;hamas&#8221; by accepting the world as presented to him, by trying to succeed within the prevailing system and not making himself fully aware of its ramifications and larger costs.</p>
<p>The Midrash maintains that the extended period it took Noah to build the Ark was intended to attract the interest of those around him, so as to make them aware of what was going on so that they would reform their behavior. It could well have also been to sensitize Noah to the implications of his own lifestyle, to demonstrate to him that by continuing to passively live his life, he was condemning everyone around him to the coming flood.</p>
<p>Perhaps a question we need to ask ourselves is: what are the Arks that we build in our own lives to secure our own prosperity, and what are the costs (social, economic, moral) to the world at large? </p>

				<p>Meet the new Shabbat- Same as the old Shabbat.<br />
One Generation got old&#8230;Got a revolution Got to revolution </p>
<p>Forty years ago, the Jewish Catalog gave instructions for creating a pot-luck local Shabbat as a way of bringing the spirit of the Havurah to your own community. Unlike the stuffy organized synagogue, this shabbat would be participatory, celebratory, and have a counter-culture ethos. At the same time NCSY put out a little mustard colored pamphlet on how to run a circa 1972 shabbaton of asking to use the basement of a synagogue, invite friends, photocopy benchers, find a kosher take-out store for food. Unlike the stuffy organized synagogue, this shabbat would be ruah, singing, and participatory. The ethos would be counter counter-culture, how you dont need the counter-culture. </p>
<p>Now we have a wave of social-action, occupy {insert location here}, and feeling the establishment is against social -justice. They feel that Judaism has become injustice and libertarianism. There is a new blog called <a href="http://blog.occupyjudaism.org/">Occupy Judaism </a>with the byline &#8220;Bringing Occupy Wall Street to the Jews.&#8221;  In it we have an important document to recreate Shabbat as an Occupy Shabbat. Unlike the stuffy organized synagogue, this one will be social action oriented. The 1970&#8217;s rejected the organizational man of the 1950&#8217;s and this one rejects the organizational man of the 1990&#8217;s. As I read it, it looks and sounds like many documents of the early 1970&#8217;s, except for the absence of the faux-Hasidic ideal. It could almost have been written by NJOP of Effie Buchwald circa 1980 (except for the egalitarianism.)<br />
For those old enough to remember, substitute at the right places &#8220;Save Soviet Jewry&#8221; &#8220;Russia is not healthy for Jews and other living things&#8221; &#8220;Free Biafra&#8221; &#8220;Never Again&#8221; </p>
<blockquote><p>Want to Occupy Shabbat in your community? Here’s how to get started!</p>
<p>    Start planning a week in advance.<br />
    Decide whether you want to do Kabbalat Shabbat and a potluck dinner, or just a potluck dinner.<br />
    Check in with your local occupation’s relevant working groups to make sure you won’t be creating a disturbance and find a good location to hold your event. Aim for a place that’s relatively quiet and decently lit at night.<br />
    Create an online sign-up sheet where people can volunteer to take on responsibilities for different pieces of the service or dinner. We recommended either Google Docs or Etherpad.<br />
    For Kabbalat Shabbat:<br />
        Determine what kind of service you want to have. Aim for the highest level of inclusivity as possible according to the needs of your community.<br />
        Aim for gender neutrality – welcoming people of all genders to lead and participate in services, without division.<br />
        You will want to find experienced volunteers to lead services – preferably one for Kabbalat Shabbat and one for Maariv.<br />
        If you expect a larger crowd, you may want to have several people with strong voices supporting the service leader.<br />
        If you need help learning the liturgy, check out Siddur Audio.<br />
        You may want to bring extra siddurim (prayer books), kippot/yarlmulkes, and instruments (if applicable) for those that do not have or who forget to bring their own.<br />
    For Shabbat dinner:<br />
        You will need volunteers to say the blessings over grape juice and challah, as well as birkat hamazon (grace after meals).<br />
        Make sure that potluck participants sign-up to bring a kiddush cup, grape juice, challah, a challah cover, water for people to wash with, a towel for hand drying, and some bentshers (prayerbooks containing grace after meals and Shabbat songs). You will also need bags for trash and recycling.<br />
        If it will be cold and/or wet outside, consider bringing a folding table.<br />
        Try to ensure an even mix of appetizers, entrees and desserts.<br />
        Encourage people to bring either their own reusable plates and utensils from home, or biodegradable plates, utensils and napkins to share with others. Don’t forget serving utensils!<br />
    For either Kabbalat Shabbat or Shabbat dinner:<br />
        You should find someone to give a d’var tzdek – a short Torah teaching that connects the efforts of the Occupy Wall Street movement back to either the current Torah portion or to Jewish values more broadly. Check out AJWS and Jewcology for ideas.<br />
    Create a Facebook, Tumblr or Eventbrite page calling for a Kabbalat Shabbat service and/or Shabbat potluck dinner at your local occupation.<br />
        Set the start-time for shortly after sundown.<br />
        Specify the location where you’ll be meeting.<br />
        Be sure to include the link to your volunteer sign-up sheet.<br />
        Tell people to bring their own prayer books or to download and print out their own prayer sheets (Kabbalat Shabbat | Shabbat Meal).<br />
        If the space is not terribly well-lit, let folks know who are non-halakhic to bring flashlights or headlamps to read by.<br />
        Let people know your event is open to non-Jewish observers and participants.<br />
    Invite every Jew you know in your local area! Ask your friends who say ‘Yes’ to invite their friends as well.<br />
    Share the event with Facebook and Google groups frequented by Jews in your local community.<br />
    Reach out to progressive Jewish congregations and Jewish social justice organizations in your community and ask them to partner with or promote your event.<br />
    Share the event on your local occupation’s Facebook page, as well as tweeting it at them.<br />
    Post your event to the Occupy Judaism Facebook page and tweet it at us as well. Use the hashtag #occupyshabbat.<br />
    Let your local Jewish newspaper and blogs know!<br />
    Consider having an email sign-up sheet the day of your event for people who are comfortable writing on Shabbat. Try to have a clipboard handy.<br />
    If your event is a success, consider building on the momentum by setting up an Occupy Judaism Facebook or Google group for your local community. Use the group to plan future actions: those that bring more Jews out to your local occupation and those that bring the values of the occupation back to your Jewish community.<br />
    Consider having members of your group join the working group at your local occupation that deals with outreach to the spiritual/religious community.<br />
    Have your group’s key organizers join the Occupy Judaism National Working Group (which is far less daunting than it sounds). Email us at info at occupyjudaism dot org.<br />

				<p>Interesting series of mini-interviews at Moment. Here are four of my favorites.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/12/symposium.html"><strong>THE ORIGINS OF JEWISH CREATIVITY</strong></a><br />
Moment Talks With Artists, Scientists and Scholars to Illuminate the Source of Human Creativity</p>
<p><strong>David Brooks</strong></p>
<p>The dominant theory about creativity is that it is the result of the blending of two different idea networks. The classic example is Picasso, who took the idea network of the Western artistic tradition and the idea network of African masks—not just their physical look but the spirituality implied by them—and jammed them together like two galaxies crashing. That’s how it works: Two networks crash, and out of the ensuing clashes, conflicts, congruences, you spin off new things. So creativity is very rarely inventing something new out of whole cloth; it’s using two or more old things to create new combinations. The theory of why Jews are so accomplished has to do with them living in what one historian calls “verges”—spots where different cultures come together, whether it’s Jerusalem, Istanbul, Baghdad or New York, places with a lot of traders, a lot of coming and going, where ideas are clashing. And then as Jews we’ve got our own experience of our minority culture clashing with whatever majority culture we’re living in—whether Christian or something else. That gives us the ideal space for new things to come in. It gives you a Saul Bellow, for instance, mixing his Jewish heritage with the tough guy culture of Chicago, so he ends up with a sensibility that’s part Chicago tough guy and part Talmudic intellectual. That’s my theory.</p>
<p><strong>David Brooks</strong> is a columnist for The New York Times and the author of The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald Schroeder</strong></p>
<p>Einstein said it perfectly: Religion without science is blind. A Jewish mystic said that when the Torah came into the world, it was split in two parts—one part was given on Sinai and the other part is nature. Creativity arises from wonder, from being amazed at the magnificence of the world—wondering what’s underlying all the amazing complexity we see all around us. Judaism favors asking questions, whereas some religions expect you to take everything on faith. The very fact that Jews ask questions means they’re being creative because they’re wondering how things work. Doubting isn’t against our faith; for me, doubting is part of it. Doubting is trying to understand how the world works. The subtlety of biblical text itself encourages trying to understand its deeper meaning, looking below the surface to understand what’s really there. Creativity is digging below the surface and finding what’s under the superficial world we see. And in this sense, I think Moses was creative because he realized that God wants arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald Schroeder</strong> is a physicist and also teaches at Aish HaTorah College of Jewish Studies. He is author of four books, including The Science of God: The Convergence of Scientific and Biblical Wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Matt</strong></p>
<p>The Zohar, the foundational text of kabbalah, is a celebration of creativity—it shows how the Torah endlessly unfolds in meaning. Jacob ben-Sheshet Gerondi, a 13th century kabbalist, said it’s a mitzvah for every wise person to innovate in Torah according to his capacity. That’s refreshing because you often hear the traditional notion, to accept what’s been handed down or to learn from the master because you’re not able to create on your own. But ben-Sheshet says (after conveying one of his innovations), “If I hadn’t invented it in my mind I would say that this was transmitted to Moses at Mt. Sinai.” He’s aware that his interpretation is new, but he thinks it harmonizes with the ultimate source of tradition—the creative work itself is somehow deeply connected to an ancient mainstream. An essential component of all creativity is tapping into something deeper than your normal state of mind.</p>
<p>The basic approach of the rabbis is to apply midrash to reading the Torah—the rabbis are willing to be very bold in their interpretation. It’s natural for a Jew to be bold and innovative—that’s the secret to keeping the tradition alive. The Zohar reads the very opening words of the Torah radically. Instead of “In the beginning God created,” it’s “In the beginning the Infinite created God.” It sounds bizarre to say that God is the object of creation, but I think the meaning is that what we think of as God doesn’t do justice to the true nature of God, which they call ein sof, “without end.” Going beyond traditional midrash, the Zohar employs radical creativity to make us question our current assumptions about life, about the nature of the human being, about God and spirituality. It moves through the Torah verse by verse asking probing, challenging questions. As the Zohar says, “God is known and grasped to the degree that one opens the gates of imagination,” so it’s up to our imaginative faculty to understand reality, or the reality of God.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Matt</strong> served for 20 years as a professor of Jewish spirituality at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. He is currently composing a multi-volume annotated translation of the Zohar, entitled The Zohar: Pritzker Edition. </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Boyarin</strong></p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud is the most extraordinary creation of the Jewish people—it speaks a kind of manic energy and records that extraordinary energy and vitality from the areas where it was produced in the Babylonian Diaspora. Jews were imbued with creative energy through the intense study of this one peculiar vibrant work through the centuries. Sholom Aleichem, for example, records how the world of talmudic learning was diffused from the yeshiva throughout Jewish communities across class and gender. While the making of the Talmud was a creative act, so was the Jewish openness to many cultures: The cross-fertilization between ancient Jewish tradition and the outside world led to the taking in of new ideas and energy. Since the 19th century, much of Jewish creativity has stemmed from being in two cultures at the same time. Being in a position to observe a culture that you are also a part of is very conducive to creativity.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Boyarin,</strong> Hermann P. and Sophia Taubman Professor of Talmudic Culture at the University of California Berkeley, has written extensively on the Talmud and gender studies.<br />
